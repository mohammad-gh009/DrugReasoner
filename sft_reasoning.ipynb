The final step in the synthesis of acetylcholine consists of the choline acetylase transfer of acetyl group from acetylcoenzyme A to choline. Acetylcholine is the neurohumoral transmitter in the parasympathetic system and as such maintains the normal functions of the intestine. Decrease in acetylcholine content would result in decreased peristalsis and in extreme cases adynamic ileus. \\', \\'mechanism of action\\': \\'Dexpanthenol is an alcohol derivative of pantothenic acid, a component of the B complex vitamins and an essential component of a normally functioning epithelium.

Adverse events observed in the HIV studies included granulocytopenia, dizziness, and paresthesia. Leukopenia and neutropenia have also been observed in a similar group of patients receiving 800 mg/day or above.\\', \\'indication\\': \"For the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderate type 1 (nonneuropathic) Gaucher\\'s disease for whom enzyme replacement therapy is not a therapeutic option (e.g. due to constraints such as allergy, hypersensitivity, or poor venous access). Now approved in some countries for the treatment of progressive neurological symptoms in adult and pediatric patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C). \", \\'pharmacodynamics\\': \"Miglustat, an N-alkylated imino sugar, is a synthetic analogue of D-glucose. Miglustat is an inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase, which is a glucosyl transferase enzyme responsible for catalyzing the formation of glucosylceramide (glucocerebroside). Glucosylceramide is a substrate for the endogenous glucocerebrosidase, an enzyme that is deficient in Gaucher\\'s disease. The accumulation of glucosylceramide due to the absence of glucocerebrosidase results in the storage of this material in the lysosomes of tissue macrophages, leading to widespread pathology due to infiltration of lipid-engorged macrophages in the viscera, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. This results in secondary hematologic consequences including sever anemia and thrombocytopenia, in addition to the characteristic progressive hepatosplenomegaly, as well as skeletal complications including osteonecrosis and osteopenia with secondary pathological fractures.\", \\'mechanism of action\\': \\'Miglustat functions as a competitive and reversible inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase, the initial enzyme in a series of reactions which results in the synthesis of most glycosphingolipids. The goal of treatment with miglustat is to reduce the rate of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis so that the amount of glycosphingolipid substrate is reduced to a level which allows the residual activity of the deficient glucocerebrosidase enzyme to be more effective (substrate reduction therapy), reducing the accumulation of glucocerebroside in macrophages. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that miglustat can reduce the synthesis of glucosylceramide-based glycosphingolipids. In clinical trials, miglustat improved liver and spleen volume, as well as hemoglobin concentration and platelet count. Inhibition of glycosphingolipid synthesis has also shown to reduce intracellular lipid storage, improve fluid-phase endosomal uptake and normalize lipid transport in peripheral blood B lymphocytes of NP-C patients, which results in a decrease in the potentially neurotoxic accumulation of gnagliosides G<sub>M2</sub> and G<sub>M3</sub>, lactosylceramide and glucosylceramide, possibly preventing further neuronal damage. Other studies have also suggested that miglustat may indirectly modulate intracellular calcium homeostasis through its effects on glucosylceramide levels, and evidence has shown that an initiating factor in the pathogenesis of NP-C may be impaired calcium homeostasis related to sphingosine storage. Therefore, the effect that miglustat exerts on intracellular calcium levels may influence an important underlying pathogenic mechanism of NP-C.\\', \\'metabolism\\': \\'There is no evidence that miglustat is metabolized in humans.\\', \\'descriptions\\': \\'Miglustat, commonly marketed under the trade name Zavesca, is a drug used to treat Gaucher disease. It inhibits the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase, an essential enzyme for the synthesis of most glycosphingolipids. It is only used for patients who cannot be treated with enzyme replacement therapy with imiglucerase. Miglustat is now the first and only approved therapy for patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C). It has recently been approved for treatment of progressive neurological symptoms in adult and pediatric patients in the European Union, Brazil, and South Korea. Miglustat was first developed as an anti-HIV agent in the 1990s. However, clinical experience with miglustat showed that therapeutic levels of the drug could not be achieved in patients without a high incidence of adverse effect.\\'}, {\\'name\\': \\'Glucosamine\\', \\'similarity score\\': 0.8864784836769104, \\'approval groups\\': [\\'approved\\', \\'investigational\\'], \\'average mass\\': 179.1711, \\'half life\\': \\'The estimated half-life for glucosamine is 15 hours after an oral dose.[A232279] After a bolus intravenous injection of 1005 mg crystalline glucosamine sulfate, the parent drug has an apparent half life of 1.11 hours.[A232274]\\', \\'toxicity\\': \\'The oral LD50 of glucosamine in rats is >5000 mg/kg.[L32684] Symptoms of an overdose with glucosamine may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea (common side effects of this drug).

Studies to this date examining the efficacy of glucosamine sulfate have been inconclusive. Glycosaminoglycans contribute to joint cartilage elasticity, strength, and flexibility.[A232144] A systematic review of various studies and guidelines determined that modest improvements were reported for joint pain and function in patients taking glucosamine.

Because glucosamine is a precursor for glycosaminoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans are a major component of joint cartilage,[A232289] glucosamine supplements may help to rebuild cartilage and treat the symptoms of arthritis.  Some in vitro studies show evidence that glucosamine reduces inflammation via inhibition of interferon gamma[A12619,A12616,A12621]  and Nuclear factor kappa B subunit 65 (NF-κB p65),[A12616,A232284] improving the symptoms of arthritis and joint pain.

In patients with amenable galactosidase alpha gene (GLA) mutations, globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) levels tended to decrease in the urine and in the kidney interstitial capillaries.[L47057]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn an in vitro assay (HEK-293 assay), Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK-293) cell lines were transfected with specific GLA variants (mutations) which produced mutant alpha-Gal A proteins. In the transfected cells, amenability of the GLA variants was assessed after a 5-day incubation with 10 micromol/L migalastat. A GLA variant was categorized as amenable if the resultant mutant alpha-Gal A activity (measured in the cell lysates) met two criteria: 1) it showed a relative increase of at least 20% compared to the pre-treatment alpha-Gal A activity, and 2) it showed an absolute increase of at least 3% of the wild-type (normal) alpha-Gal activity. The in vitro assay did not evaluate the trafficking of the mutant alpha-Gal A proteins into the lysosome or the dissociation of migalastat from the mutant alpha-Gal A proteins within the lysosome. Also, the in vitro assay did not test whether a GLA variant causes Fabry disease or not.[L47036] \\', \\'mechanism of action\\': \\'Fabry disease is a progressive X-linked lysosomal storage disorder that affects males and females [FDA Label, F1107]. Fabry disease-causing mutations occur in the galactosidase alpha (GLA) gene and result in a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) that is required for glycosphingolipid substrate (GL-3 and lyso-Gb3) metabolism [FDA Label, F1107]. Reduced alpha-Gal A activity is, therefore, associated with the progressive accumulation of glycosphingolipid substrate in vulnerable organs and tissues, which ultimately leads to the morbidity and mortality associated with Fabry disease.[L47057]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMigalastat is a pharmacological chaperone that reversibly binds to the active site of the alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) protein (encoded by the galactosidase alpha gene, GLA), which is deficient in Fabry disease. This binding stabilizes alpha-Gal A allowing its trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum into the lysosome where it exerts its action. In the lysosome, at a lower pH and at a higher concentration of relevant substrates, migalastat dissociates from alpha-Gal A allowing it to break down the glycosphingolipids globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3). Certain GLA variants (mutations) causing Fabry disease result in the production of abnormally folded and less stable forms of the alpha-Gal A protein which, however, retain enzymatic activity. Those GLA variants, referred to as amenable variants, produce alpha-Gal A proteins that may be stabilized by migalastat thereby restoring their trafficking to lysosomes and their intralysosomal activity.[L47036] \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe GLA mutations that are amenable and not amenable to treatment with migalastat are regularly maintained and updated on online sites that are readily accessible by healthcare providers.[L47036]   \\', \\'metabolism\\': \\'Based upon in vivo data, migalastat is a substrate for uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (otherwise known as UGT or UDPGT), being a minor elimination pathway.[L47036]\\', \\'descriptions\\': \"Fabry disease is a rare, progressive genetic disorder characterized by a defective GLA gene that causes a deficiency in the enzyme alpha-Galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A). This enzyme is responsible for breaking down glycosphingolipid substrate that, when deficient in patients with Fabry disease, builds up in the blood vessels, the kidneys, the nerves, the heart, and other organs.[L47036,L47057,L4274,L4278] In the U.S., it is estimated that more than 3,000 people are living with Fabry disease, and an estimated more than 50 percent of these diagnosed patients are currently untreated.[L4274]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMigalastat (approved and sold under Amicus Therapeutics\\' brand name Galafold) is subsequently an oral pharmacological chaperone of alpha-Gal A for the treatment of Fabry disease in adults who have amenable GLA variants.[L47036,L47057,L4274,L4278] In these patients, migalastat works by stabilizing the body’s dysfunctional alpha-Gal A enzyme so that it can clear the accumulation of glycosphingolipid disease substrate.[L47036,L47057,L4274,L4278] Globally, it is estimated that approximately 35 to 50 percent of Fabry patients may have amenable GLA variants that are treatable with migalastat.

Dermal LD50 value in rat and mouse was reported to be greater than 928 mg/kg bw, according to an acute dermal toxicity study [F44]. Extremely high doses may cause ringing in the ears, shortness of breath, convulsions, collapse, vomiting and delirium [F43]. Nausea and vomiting were seen individuals with sensitive stomachs following oral ingestion of 15 g of dried uva ursi leaves that contain arbutin [F43]. \\', \\'indication\\': \\'Indicated for over-the-counter use for epidermal hyperpigmentation in various skin conditions, such as melasma, freckles, and senile lentigines. \\', \\'pharmacodynamics\\': \\'At non-toxic concentrations, arbutin inhibited the activity of tyrosinase in cultured human keratinocytes, while having minimal effect on the expression of tyrosinase mRNA or the synthesis of the enzyme [A27248]. α-Arbutin produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of melanin synthesis of human melanoma cells, HMV-II [A32939]. No inhibitory effect on HMV-II cell growth was seen at concentrations lower than 1.0 mM. At concentrations of 0.5 mM of arbutin, tyrosinase activity was reduced to 60% of that in non-treated cells [A32939]. The addition of arbutin blocked and inhibited α-MSH-stimulated melanogenesis in B16 melanoma cells, brownish guinea pig, and human skin tissue [A32940]. In a pilot study of healthy male adults exposed to UV B irradiation, topical administration of arbutin inhibited UV-induced nuclear factor-kappaB activation in human keratinocytes [F43]. In mouse skin, arbutin counteracted oxidative stress induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate [F43].\\', \\'mechanism of action\\': \\'Arbutin is a hydroquinone glycoside, however the hydroquinone moiety is not solely responsible for the de-pigmentating actions of arbutin [A32942]. It acts as a competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase enzyme by acting on the L-tyrosine binding site to suppress melanogenesis and mediate its de-pigmenting actions on human skin [A27248]. Tyrosinase is an enzyme involved in the regulation of rate-limiting steps during the synthesis of melanin; it regulates the conversion of L-tyrosine into L-dopa, and subsequent conversion of L-dopa to L-dopaquinone [A27248]. Via inhibition of tyrosinase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, arbutin attenuates the production of melanin in melanocytes. While most studies suggest that arbutin has negligible effect on the tyrosinase mRNA expression, a study assessing the effect of arbutin on melanocyte differentiation inducement system using ES cells propose that arbutin may also downregulate the expression of tyrosinase in addition to its inhibitory action on the enzyme [A32938]. The contradictory findings across studies may be due to previous studies using terminally-differentiated melanocytes and melanoma cells [A32938]. \\', \\'metabolism\\': \\'Arbutin is readily susceptible to hydrolysis in dilute acids to yield D-glucose and hydroquinone. It is expected that orally administered arbutin is easily hydrolyzed to free hydroquinone molecules by stomach acid [F43]. Hydroquinone is further metabolized into the main metabolites, hydroquinone glucuronide and hydroquinone sulfate [F43]. \\', \\'descriptions\\': \\'Extracted from the dried leaves of bearberry plant in the genus _Arctostaphylos_ and other plants commonly in the _Ericaceae_ family, arbutin is a beta-D-glucopyranoside of [DB09526]. It is found in foods, over-the-counter drugs, and herbal dietary supplements [F43]. Most commonly, it is an active ingredient in skincare and cosmetic products as a skin-lightening agent for the prevention of melanin formation in various skin conditions that involve cutaneous hyperpigmentation or hyperactive melanocyte function [A27248]. It has also been used as an anti-infective for the urinary system as well as a diuretic [F43]. Arbutin is available in both natural and synthetic forms; it can be synthesized from acetobromglucose and [DB09526] [F43]. Arbutin is a competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase (E.C.1.14.18.1) in melanocytes [A27248], and the inhibition of melanin synthesis at non-toxic concentrations was observed _in vitro_.

        "Okay, let's try to figure out why the compound X wasn't approved even though the initial analysis suggested it might be. First, I need to recall the data provided. The user mentioned that the model listed similar approved and non-approved molecules. The approved ones like Dexpanthenol, Miglustat, Glucosamine, and Nadolol had high similarity scores. The non-approved ones included Duvoglustat, Migalastat, Arbutin, and Indole-3-carbinol.\n",
        "\n",
        "The initial analysis looked at drug-likeness rules (Lipinski, Veber) and ADMET properties, and everything seemed okay. Molecular weight, LogP, TPSA, rotatable bonds—all within acceptable ranges. Toxicity data from similar approved drugs suggested low acute toxicity. So why the rejection?\n",
        "\n",
        "Hmm, maybe the answer lies in the specifics of the non-approved molecules. Let me check those again. Migalastat is mentioned as approved but under accelerated pathways, which sometimes means there's conditional approval pending further studies. Duvoglustat is investigational, so maybe it has issues. Arbutin is approved but for topical use, which is different from systemic administration. Indole-3-carbinol is investigational, possibly with unresolved safety issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "Wait, the user said the true answer is \"Not Approved.\" So what's missing here? Maybe the ADMET profile isn't as good as thought. Let's re-examine the ADMET part. The compound has low LogP (-1.14), which is quite hydrophilic. High solubility is good, but too low LogP can mean poor membrane permeability, making oral bioavailability challenging. Even if similar approved drugs have low LogP, maybe this compound's combination of properties leads to poor absorption despite passing the rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another angle: the similar non-approved drugs. If the compound is structurally closer to non-approved ones with issues, that's a red flag. For example, Migalastat's approval is under accelerated pathways with ongoing trials. If compound X's mechanism or metabolism mirrors a drug that later showed toxicity in confirmatory trials, that could be a problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, looking at the approved analogs: Dexpanthenol is used topically or as a supplement. Miglustat is for a rare disease (Gaucher) with specific indications. If compound X is intended for a broader use, the safety profile might not hold up. The high similarity to Dexpanthenol might not translate to efficacy in a different therapeutic area.\n",
        "\n",
        "Toxicity data: The LD50 values from Dexpanthenol are high, but maybe compound X has off-target effects not captured in acute toxicity. Chronic toxicity or specific organ toxicity (like hepatotoxicity) could be a concern. The initial analysis didn't mention CYP interactions or detailed metabolism beyond what's in similar drugs. If compound X has unique metabolites that are toxic, that's a risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pharmacodynamics and mechanism of action: If the approved analogs work through well-understood mechanisms but compound X's MoA is novel or less understood, regulators might be cautious. The non-approved analogs might have mechanisms that failed in clinical trials, and similarity to those could be a negative.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another point: The presence of 4 hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. While within Lipinski's limits, this might lead to high polarity, affecting passive diffusion. Even if TPSA is under 140, the specific arrangement could hinder absorption.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, the rotatable bonds (6) are at the higher end of Veber's criteria. This might increase molecular flexibility, potentially leading to poor bioavailability or rapid metabolism. Approved drugs with similar counts might have optimized structures that compound X lacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Looking at the non-approved list, Arbutin is approved but for topical use. If compound X is intended for systemic use, the safety profile from topical applications doesn't guarantee safety orally or intravenously. Similarly, Indole-3-carbinol is investigational, possibly due to insufficient efficacy or safety concerns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regulatory agencies also look at therapeutic need. If compound X is similar to existing drugs but doesn't offer significant advantages (e.g., better efficacy, fewer side effects), approval might be denied. The market might already be saturated with similar molecules.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, maybe the model's similarity scores aren't the whole story. Structural similarity doesn't always translate to similar pharmacokinetics or dynamics. Subtle differences in the structure could lead to unexpected issues in clinical trials, like drug interactions or immune responses not seen in analogs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Putting it all together, despite passing initial drug-likeness and ADMET checks, compound X's high similarity to drugs with limited use (topical, rare diseases) or non-approved molecules, combined with potential bioavailability issues and lack of therapeutic innovation, likely led to its rejection.\n",
