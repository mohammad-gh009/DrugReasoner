Some weights of RobertaModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /home/u111169/wrkdir/mgh-project/arxive/checkpoints-arxive/fine_tuning_chemberta_classic_way/augmented/checkpoint-500 and are newly initialized: ['roberta.pooler.dense.bias', 'roberta.pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.
