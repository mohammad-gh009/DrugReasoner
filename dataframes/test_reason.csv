Approximately 10% of patients with NSCLC have a rapid and clinically effective response to EGFR-TKIs due to the presence of specific activating EGFR mutations within the tumour cells.[A7927] More specifically, deletions around the LREA motif in exon 19 and exon 21 L858R point mutations are correlated with response to therapy.[A7928]\r\n\r\nDevelopment of third-generation EGFR-TKIs, such as osimertinib, has been in response to altered tumour resistance patterns following treatment and toxic side effects that impact patient quality of life. Treatment with first-generation EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib and erlotinib) has been associated with the development of resistance through activating mutations in the EGFR gene. Second-generation EGFR-TKIs (afatinib and dacomitinib) were then developed to be more potent inhibitors, although their use is associated with increased toxicity through nonspecific targeting of wild-type EGFR. In contrast, third-generation inhibitors are specific for the gate-keeper T790M mutations which increases ATP binding activity to EGFR and result in poor prognosis for late-stage disease.

However, the relative infant dose (RID) is low, 1% to 2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage [FDA Label].

Reversal of effects in females was observed following a 28-day recovery period [FDA Label]. In male rats, brexanolone was associated with decreased mating and fertility indices, decreased conception rate, lower prostate, seminal vesicle, and epididymis weight, as well as decreased sperm numbers.

Since PPD, like various other types of depression, is characterized by feelings of sadness, worthlessness or guilt, cognitive impairment, and/or possibly suicidal ideation, it is considered a life-threatening condition [F4072]. Studies have consequently found that PPD can genuinely have profound negative effects on the maternal-infant bond and later infant development [F4072, A176080, A176083]. The development and availability of brexanolone for the treatment of PPD in adult females subsequently provides a new and promising therapy where few existed before [F4066].\r\n\r\nIn particular, the use of brexanolone in treating PPD is surrounded with promise because it acts in part as a synthetic supplement for possible deficiencies in endogenous brexanolone (allopregnanolone) in postpartum women susceptible to PPD whereas many commonly used anti-depressive medications elicit actions that may modulate the presence and activity of substances like serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or monoamine oxidase but do not mediate activities directly associated with PPD like natural fluctuations in the levels of endogenous neuroactive steroids like allopregnanolone [F4063].\r\n\r\nAnd finally, although brexanolone may also be undergoing clinical trials to investigate its abilities to treat super-refractory status epilepticus, it appears that some such studies have failed to meet primary endpoints that compare success in the weaning of third-line agents and resolution of potentially life-threatening status epilepticus with brexanolone vs. placebo when added to standard-of-care [L5750].'}]","[{'name': 'Anecortave', 'simmilarity score': array([0.98643076]), 'approval status': 'not_approved', 'average mass': 344.451, 'toxicity': '', 'descriptions': 'Anecortave is under investigation in clinical trial NCT00691717 (Anecortave Acetate Safety in Patients With Open-Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension).'}, {'name': None, 'simmilarity score': array([0.98592174]), 'approval status': None, 'average mass': None, 'toxicity': None, 'descriptions': None}, {'name': None, 'simmilarity score': array([0.98284322]), 'approval status': None, 'average mass': None, 'toxicity': None, 'descriptions': None}, {'name': None, 'simmilarity score': array([0.97931826]), 'approval status': None, 'average mass': None, 'toxicity': None, 'descriptions': None}, {'name': 'Telapristone acetate', 'simmilarity score': array([0.97925782]), 'approval status': 'not_approved', 'average mass': 505.655, 'toxicity': '', 'descriptions': 'Telapristone acetate, an orally-available, selective progesterone receptor modulator, is in development to alleviate symptoms associated with both uterine fibroids and endometriosis.'}]"

Indometacin was first discovered in 1963 and it was first approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration in 1965, [A486] along with other acetic acid derivatives such as [diclofenac] and [sulindac] that were also developed during the 1960s.[A177871] Since then, indometacin has been extensively studied in clinical trials as one of the most potent NSAIDs in blocking prostaglandin synthesis and was among the first NSAIDs to be used in the symptomatic treatment of migraine and for headaches that eventually became known as “indomethacin-responsive” headache disorders.[A177871] \r\n\r\nMost commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, acute shoulder pains, and acute gouty arthritis, indometacin is currently available as oral capsules as well as other methods of administration, including rectal and intravenous formulations.

Elevations of serum bilirubin may be observed due to inhibition of bilirubin transporters OATP1B1 and MRP2 by simeprevir. ', 'descriptions': ""Simeprevir is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease inhibitor indicated in patient's with HCV genotype 1 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Like all NS3/4A inhibitors, simeprevir is a serine protease inhibitor in similarity to [DB08873] and [DB05521] but is classified as a second generation protease inhibitor. This class of antiviral drugs were the first direct acting antivirals approved but are associated with lower cure rates than newer drugs. Broad use of simeprevir occurred when it was used in combination with a newer drug, [DB08934]. Inhibiting HCV NS3/4A protease in a potent and highly specific manner, simeprevir is a direct-acting antiviral agent against the hepatitis C virus. Since the viral protease NS3/4A complex is essential for cleaving the HCV encoded polyprotein into individual viral proteins facilitating replication [A19632], the drug blocks the viral replication process. It is shown to display synergistic effects with interferon-α and HCV NS5B inhibitor, and additive effects with ribavirin in HCV replicon cells [A19629]. Unlike first generation serine protease inhibitors, simprevir has a sightly different resistance profile where limited therapeutic efficacy of the drug is observed with NS3 Q80K polymorphic variants and simeprevir-specific amino acid position of 168 also results in higher treatment failure rates [A19630]. The observed prevalence of the N3 Q80K polymorphism was 30% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1a and 0.5% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1b [A19630]. \r\n\r\nAccording to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), simeprevir can be used as first-line or second-line threapies for treatment-naïve patients as adjunct to sofosbuvir treatment for genotype 1 or PEG-Interferon/ribavirin combination therapy for genotype 1 or 4. The combination therapy of simeprevir and other antiviral agents are initiated in HCV-positive patients with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].\r\n\r\nSimeprevir was approved by the FDA in November 2014 and is marketed under the brand name Olysio as oral tablets. Administered once daily with food, 150mg simeprevir capsule is used in combination with [DB08934] in patients with HCV genotype 1 without cirrhosis for 12 week duration. In patients with HCV genotype 1 with compensated cirrhosis, the treatment is directed for 24 week duration. Sustained virologic response 12 weeks after planned end of treatment (SVR12) was achieved in 170/176 (97%) subjects without cirrhosis treated with 12 weeks simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir (FDA Label). The overall SVR12 was 88% (44/50) in treatment-naïve patients with cirrhosis [L852].\r\n\r\nSimeprevir is also used in treatment of HCV genotype 4 patients with or without cirrhosis and is taken with [DB00008] and [DB00811]; this triple therapy allows shortening treatment duration from 48 weeks or longer to 12 or 24 weeks [A19630] depending on prior response status and presence of HIV-1 co-infection. Prior to initiation of treatment with [DB00008] and [DB00811], screening for the presence of virus with the NS3 Q80K polymorphism is strongly recommended and if detected, alternative treatment should be considered instead to prevent therapeutic failure. The SVR12 was 83% (29/35) in treatment-naïve patients and 86% (19/22) in relapsing patients.""}]","[{'name': 'Chlorotrianisene', 'simmilarity score': array([0.80461705]), 'approval status': 'not_approved', 'average mass': 380.864, 'toxicity': 'Acute overdosage of large doses of oral contraceptives in chidren reportedly produces almost no toxicity except nausea and vomiting.

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as paritaprevir. As a newer generation and directly acting HCV antiviral, paritaprevir products have better Sustained Virological Response (SVR) rates, higher barriers to resistance, fewer side effects, and a reduced pill burden compared to older agents such as [DB08873], [DB05521], [DB00008], [DB00022], and [DB00811]. By combining multiple antiretroviral medications into fixed dose products, the viral lifecycle can be targeted at multiple stages while simultaneously reducing the risk of developing resistant viral strains [A19593]. Within Canada and the United States, paritaprevir is currently available in three fixed dose products: Viekira Pak (FDA), Technivie (FDA and Health Canada), and Holkira Pak (Health Canada).\r\n\r\nMore specifically, paritaprevir prevents viral replication by inhibiting the NS3/4A serine protease of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) [FDA Label]. Following viral replication of HCV genetic material and translation into a single polypeptide, Nonstructural Protein 3 (NS3) and its activating cofactor Nonstructural Protein 4A (NS4A) are responsible for cleaving genetic material into the following structural and nonstructural proteins required for assembly into mature virus: NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B [A19643]. By inhibiting viral protease NS3/4A, paritaprevir therefore prevents viral replication and function. \r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Paritaprevir as a first line therapy option when used in combination with other antivirals for genotypes 1a, 1b, and 4[L852]. Depending on the genotype, Paritaprevir is often used in combination with other antivirals such as [DB09296], [DB09183], [DB00503], and [DB00811], with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as paritaprevir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635]. \r\n\r\nParitaprevir first came on the market as a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09296], [DB09183], and [DB00503] as the FDA-approved product Viekira Pak.

Under this hypothesized mechanism of action, the therapeutic effects of galantamine may decrease as the disease progression advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact.[L13571] It is therefore not considered to be a disease-modifying drug.[A203558] Galantamine is marketed under the brand name Razadyne, and is available as oral immediate- and extended-release tablets and solution.[L13571]""}, {'name': 'Butorphanol', 'simmilarity score': array([0.99285674]), 'approval status': 'approved', 'average mass': 327.4605, 'toxicity': 'The clinical manifestations of butorphanol overdose are those of opioid drugs in general.

Since the viral protease NS3/4A complex is essential for cleaving the HCV encoded polyprotein into individual viral proteins facilitating replication [A19632], the drug blocks the viral replication process.

Unlike first generation serine protease inhibitors, simprevir has a sightly different resistance profile where limited therapeutic efficacy of the drug is observed with NS3 Q80K polymorphic variants and simeprevir-specific amino acid position of 168 also results in higher treatment failure rates [A19630]. The observed prevalence of the N3 Q80K polymorphism was 30% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1a and 0.5% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1b [A19630]. \r\n\r\nAccording to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), simeprevir can be used as first-line or second-line threapies for treatment-naïve patients as adjunct to sofosbuvir treatment for genotype 1 or PEG-Interferon/ribavirin combination therapy for genotype 1 or 4. The combination therapy of simeprevir and other antiviral agents are initiated in HCV-positive patients with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].\r\n\r\nSimeprevir was approved by the FDA in November 2014 and is marketed under the brand name Olysio as oral tablets. Administered once daily with food, 150mg simeprevir capsule is used in combination with [DB08934] in patients with HCV genotype 1 without cirrhosis for 12 week duration. In patients with HCV genotype 1 with compensated cirrhosis, the treatment is directed for 24 week duration. Sustained virologic response 12 weeks after planned end of treatment (SVR12) was achieved in 170/176 (97%) subjects without cirrhosis treated with 12 weeks simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir (FDA Label). The overall SVR12 was 88% (44/50) in treatment-naïve patients with cirrhosis [L852].\r\n\r\nSimeprevir is also used in treatment of HCV genotype 4 patients with or without cirrhosis and is taken with [DB00008] and [DB00811]; this triple therapy allows shortening treatment duration from 48 weeks or longer to 12 or 24 weeks [A19630] depending on prior response status and presence of HIV-1 co-infection. Prior to initiation of treatment with [DB00008] and [DB00811], screening for the presence of virus with the NS3 Q80K polymorphism is strongly recommended and if detected, alternative treatment should be considered instead to prevent therapeutic failure. The SVR12 was 83% (29/35) in treatment-naïve patients and 86% (19/22) in relapsing patients.""}, {'name': 'Albendazole', 'simmilarity score': array([0.51499605]), 'approval status': 'approved', 'average mass': 265.331, 'toxicity': 'Symptoms of overdose include elevated liver enzymes, headaches, hair loss, low levels of white blood cells (neutropenia), fever, and itching.', 'descriptions': 'A benzimidazole broad-spectrum anthelmintic structurally related to mebendazole that is effective against many diseases.

The risk of death in drug-treated patients was about 1.6 to 1.7 times that of placebo-treated patients. Deaths were largely resulting from cardiovascular, such as heart failure and sudden death, or infectious, such as pneumonia, conditions.[label] Due to its antagonist action on dopamine receptors, prochlorperazine is associated with a risk for developing extrapyramidal symptoms such as tardive dyskinesia, which is a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. This risk is also conferred on other antipsychotic agents that block dopamine receptors. It is proposed that increased duration of the drug treatment is likely thus increased total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient leads to increased risk for developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversible. As with other antipsychotic agents, prochlorperazine is associated with a risk for causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which is a potentially fatal symptom complex, which is manifested as hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability. \r\n\r\nThere is no known antidote for prochlorperazine thus overdose treatment should be supportive and symptomatic. Overdose of prochlorperazine may produce dystonic reactions that involve extrapyramidal mechanism. To reduce these symptoms, antiparkinsonism drugs, barbiturates, or diphenhydramine may be used. Symptoms of central nervous system depression, such as somnolence or coma, may also be observed. Amphetamine, destroamphetamine, or caffeine and sodium benzoate may be used to induce stimulatory effects. In contrast, agitation and restlessness may also be seen in case of overdose. Other possible manifestations include convulsions, EKG changes and cardiac arrhythmias, fever, and autonomic reactions such as hypotension, dry mouth and ileus.

However, a number of studies involving fenofibrate and agents that are chemically and pharmacologically similar to fenofibrate demonstrate inconclusive results. In the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study, a non-significant 11% (HR 1.11 [0.95, 1.29], p=0.18) and 19% (HR 1.19 [0.90, 1.57], p=0.22) increase in total and coronary heart disease mortality, respectively, with Fenofibrate as compared to placebo [FDA Label]. For the Coronary Drug Project, a large study of post myocardial infarction of patients treated for 5 years with clofibrate, there was a difference in the rate of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis requiring surgery between the clofibrate and placebo groups of 3.0% vs. 1.8%, respectively [FDA Label]. The World Health Organization (WHO) also conducted a study in which 5000 subjects without known coronary artery disease were treated with placebo or clofibrate for 5 years and followed for an additional year [FDA Label]. The results involved a statistically significant, higher age-adjusted all-cause mortality in the clofibrate group compared with the placebo group (5.70% vs. 3.96%, p<0.01) in which excess mortality was due to a 33% increase in non-cardiovascular causes, including malignancy, post-cholecystectomy complications, and pancreatitis [FDA Label]. With the Helsinki Heart Study, 4081 middle aged men without a history of coronary artery disease were given either placebo or gemfibrozil for 5 years, with a 3.5 year open extension afterward [FDA Label]. Although total mortality was numerically higher in the gemfibrozil arm, it was statistically significant (p=0.19, 95% confidence interval for relative risk = 0.91-1.64). Finally, a secondary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study observed middle aged men not included in the primary prevention study because they had known or suspected coronary heart disease [FDA Label]. When these subjects were administered gemfibrozil or placebo therapy for 5 years, cardiac deaths trended higher in the gemfibrozil group but was ultimately not statistically significant (HR 2.2, 95% confidence interval: 0.94-5.05) [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nFibrates facilitate the risk for myopathy and have been associated with rhabdomyolysis [FDA Label]. The risk for serious muscle toxicity appears to be increased in elderly patients and in patients with diabetes, renal failure, or hypothyroidism [FDA Label]. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgia, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevations of creatine phosphokinase levels [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nFenofibrate administered across a range of doses with the higher dose equivalent to 105 mg fenofibric acid has been associated with increases in serum transaminases like AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) [FDA Label]. In a pooled analysis of 10 placebo-controlled trials, increases to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal of ALT occurred in 5.3% of patients taking Fenofibrate versus 1.1% of patients treated with placebo [FDA Label]. If enzyme levels persist above three times the normal limit, therapy is to be discontinued [FDA Label]. After discontinuing fenofibrate treatment or during continued treatment a return to normal transaminase limits was usually observed [FDA Label]. The incidence of increases in transaminases observed with fenofibrate therapy appear to be dose related [FDA Label]. From an 8 week dose-ranging study, the incidence of ALT or AST elevations to at least three times the upper limit of normal was 13% in patients receiving dosages equivalent to 35 mg to 105 mg fenofibric acid per day and was comparatively 0% in those receiving placebo or doses equivalent to 35 mg or less fenofibric acid per day [FDA Label]. Hepatocellular, chronic active and cholestatic hepatitis associated with Fenofibrate therapy have been reported after exposures of weeks to several years [FDA Label]. In extremely rare cases, cirrhosis has been reported in associated with chronic active hepatitis [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nIncreases in serum creatinine have been reported in patients on Fenofibrate [FDA Label]. These elevations tend to return to baseline following discontinuation of the drug [FDA Label]. Although the clinical significance of these observations is unknown, renal monitoring should be considered for patients with renal impairment and for patients at risk for renal insufficiency, perhaps like patients with diabetes or the elderly [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nFenofibric acid may increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to cholelithiasis [FDA Label]. If gallstones are found, fenofibric acid should be discontinued [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nCaution must be exercised over the ability of fenofibric acid to potentiate the anticoagulant effects of coumarin anticoagulants, resulting in prolongation of the prothrombin time/International Normalized Ratio (PT/INR) [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nPancreatitis has also been reported in patients taking Fenofibrate [FDA Label]. This effect may be caused by the failure of efficacy in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, a direct drug effect, or a secondary phenomenon mediated through biliary tract stone or sludge formation with obstruction of the common bile duct [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nMild to moderate hemoglobin, hematocrit, and white blood cell decreases have been observed in patients following the start of fenofibrate therapy [FDA Label]. However, although these levels tend to stabilize during long-term administration of the medication [FDA Label], thrombocytopenia and agranulocytosis have been observed in patients treated with fenofibrates as well [FDA Label]. Scheduled monitoring of red and white blood cell counts during the first 12 months of fenofibric acid administration is subsequently recommended [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nAcute hypersensitivity reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis requiring patient hospitalization and treatment with steroids have been reported in patients treated with fenofibrates [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nIn the fenofibrate arm during the FIELD trial, occurrences of pulmonary embolus (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were recorded at higher rates when compared to the placebo group [FDA Label]. In particular, the placebo group had N=4900 and the fenofibrate group N=4895 [FDA Label]. For DVT there were 48 events (1%) in the placebo group and 67 (1%) in the fenofibrate group with p=0.074 [FDA Label]. While for PE, there were 32 (0.7%) events in the placebo group and 53 (1%) in the fenofibrate group with p=0.022 [FDA Label]. Likewise, in the Coronary Drug Project, a higher proportion of the clofibrate group reported definite or suspected fatal or nonfatal PE or thrombophlebitis when compared to the placebo group (5.2% vs 3.3% at 5 years with p<0.01) [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nAdditionally there have been postmarketing and clinical trial reports of serious paradoxical decreases in HDL cholesterol levels to as low as 2 mg/dL happening in diabetic and non-diabetic patients initiated on fibrate therapy [FDA Label]. This decrease in HDL-C is accompanied by a decrease in apolipoprotein A1. Such decreases have been reported to occur within 2 weeks to years after initiation of fibrate therapy [FDA Label]. The HDL-C levels remain depressed until fibrate therapy has been withdrawn; the response to withdrawal of fibrate therapy is in fact rapid and sustained [FDA Label]. HDL-C levels are recommended to be checked within the first few months after initiation of fibrate therapy. In the case of severely depressed HDL-C levels being detected, fibrate therapy should be withdrawn and HDL-C levels monitored until it has returned to baseline with no intention or plan to re-initiate fibrate therapy [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nAdverse effects associated with the use of fenofibrate and fenofibric acid include abdominal pain, back pain, headache, nausea, constipation, abnormal liver tests, increased AST, increased ALT, increased creatine phosphokinase, respiratory disorder, rhinitis, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, myalgia, pain in extremity, and/or dizziness [FDA Label, L1526].\r\n\r\nAdverse effects identified during the post-approval use period of fenofibrate include rhabdomyolysis, panrcreatitis, renal failure, muscle spasms, acute renal failure, hepatitis, cirrhosis, anemia, asthenia, and severely depressed HDL-cholesterol levels [L1526].\r\n\r\nAs Fenofibric acid has the capability to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of coumarin anticoagulants (and subsequently prolong the PT/INR of patients), caution should be exercised when oral coumarin anticoagulants are given in conjunction with fenofibric acid. Frequent PT/INR determinations are therefore advisable until stabilized PT/INR readings are obtained\r\n[FDA Label, L1526].\r\n\r\nFenofibric acid should be administered to patients at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after a bile acid resin is given as such drugs may bind other agents being given concurrently and impede their absorption [FDA Label, L1526].\r\n\r\nImmunosuppressant medications like cyclosporine and tacrolimus can cause nephrotoxicity with decreases in creatinine clearance and rises in serum creatinine, and because renal excretion is the main elimination route for fenofibric acid, there exists a risk that an interaction could lead to deterioration of renal function [FDA Label, L1526]. As a consequence, the benefits and risks of using fenofibric acid with any other potentially nephrotoxic agents should be carefully considered and the lowest effective dose employed [FDA Label, L1526].\r\n\r\nCases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with fenofibrates co-administered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when considering the combination use of fenofibrates with colchicine [FDA Label, L1526].\r\n\r\nNo well controlled studies regarding the use of fenofibric acid in pregnant women have been established [FDA Label, L1526]. Since the safety of fenofibric acid in pregnant women has not been formally elucidated, fenofibric acid should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus [FDA Label, L1526].\r\n\r\nMoreover, fenofibric acid should not be used in nursing mothers. Under the circumstances, a decision should be made between having to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the use of fenofibric acid, taking into perspective the importance of the drug therapy to the mother [FDA Label, L1526].\r\n\r\nThe safety and effectiveness of fenofibric acid in paediatric patients has not been formally established [FDA Label, L1526].\r\n\r\nFenofibric acid is predominantly excreted by the kidney system unchanged or as fenofibric acid glucuronide [FDA Label, L1526]. The risk of experiencing adverse reactions associated with exposure to fenofibric acid may consequently be greater in patients with impaired renal function [FDA Label, L1526]. Subsequently, because elderly patients may have a higher incidence of renal impairment, the dosage of fenofibric acid for geriatric patients should be based upon renal function, with normal renal function requiring no dosage modifications [FDA Label, L1526]. Renal function monitoring in elderly patients taking fenofibric acid is recommended [FDA Label, L1526].\r\n\r\nIn patients with severe renal impairment, the use of fenofibric acid is to be avoided while dose reductions is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [FDA Label, L1526].

Deaths were largely resulting from cardiovascular, such as heart failure and sudden death, or infectious, such as pneumonia, conditions.[label] Due to its antagonist action on dopamine receptors, prochlorperazine is associated with a risk for developing extrapyramidal symptoms such as tardive dyskinesia, which is a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. This risk is also conferred on other antipsychotic agents that block dopamine receptors. It is proposed that increased duration of the drug treatment is likely thus increased total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient leads to increased risk for developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversible. As with other antipsychotic agents, prochlorperazine is associated with a risk for causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which is a potentially fatal symptom complex, which is manifested as hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability. \r\n\r\nThere is no known antidote for prochlorperazine thus overdose treatment should be supportive and symptomatic. Overdose of prochlorperazine may produce dystonic reactions that involve extrapyramidal mechanism. To reduce these symptoms, antiparkinsonism drugs, barbiturates, or diphenhydramine may be used. Symptoms of central nervous system depression, such as somnolence or coma, may also be observed. Amphetamine, destroamphetamine, or caffeine and sodium benzoate may be used to induce stimulatory effects. In contrast, agitation and restlessness may also be seen in case of overdose. Other possible manifestations include convulsions, EKG changes and cardiac arrhythmias, fever, and autonomic reactions such as hypotension, dry mouth and ileus. Hypotension can be responded with the standard measures for managing circulatory shock.[label] \r\n\r\n**Nonclinical Toxicology**\r\n\r\nIn a rat developmental or reproductive toxicity study, abnormalities in both the reproductive measures and neurobehavioral testing were observed following administration of 25 mg/kg of prochlorperazine.[L6649] \r\n\r\n**Use in specific populations**\r\n\r\nAs the use of antipsychotic agents during the third trimester of pregnancy is associated with a risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery, the use of prochlorperazine in pregnant patients is generally not recommended and it should be limited after careful consideration of the potential benefit of drug therapy justifying the potential risk to the fetus. Caution should be exercised when prochlorperazine is administered to a nursing mother. While lower doses of prochlorperazine is reported to be safe for elderly patients, caution is still advised, especially those with higher susceptibility to hypotension and neuromuscular reactions.[label]', 'descriptions': 'Prochlorperazine, also known as compazine, is a piperazine phenothiazine and first-generation antipsychotic drug that is used for the treatment of severe nausea and vomiting, as well as short-term management of psychotic disorders such as generalized non-psychotic anxiety and schizophrenia.[label] It mainly works by depressing the chemoreceptor trigger zone and blocking D2 dopamine receptors in the brain. It was shown to also block histaminergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic receptors.[L6637] Prochlorperazine was first developed in the 1950s [L6643] and was first approved by the FDA in 1956. Although newer antiemetic agents such as 5-HT3 antagonists are more heavily promoted, prochlorperazine is still widely used in nausea and vomiting.[L6640]'}, {'name': 'Aripiprazole', 'simmilarity score': array([0.99488312]), 'approval status': 'approved', 'average mass': 448.385, 'toxicity': ""Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY, during the third trimester of  pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. Overall available data from published epidemiologic studies of pregnant women exposed to aripiprazole have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, or major depressive disorder, and with exposure to antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, during pregnancy.[L45859] \r\n\r\nIn animal reproduction studies, oral and intravenous aripiprazole administration during organogenesis in rats and/or rabbits at doses 10 and 19 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 30 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area, produced fetal death, decreased fetal weight, undescended testicles, delayed skeletal ossification, skeletal abnormalities, and diaphragmatic hernia. Oral and intravenous aripiprazole administration during the pre- and post-natal period in rats at doses 10 times the MRHD based on mg/m2 body surface area, produced prolonged gestation, stillbirths, decreased pup weight, and decreased pup survival.[L45859]  \r\n\r\nABILIFY has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of ABILIFY misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drug-seeking behavior).[L45859]\r\n\r\nIn physical dependence studies in monkeys, withdrawal symptoms were observed upon abrupt cessation of dosing. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drug-seeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed.[L45859] \r\n\r\nIn clinical trials and in postmarketing experience, adverse reactions of deliberate or accidental overdosage with oral ABILIFY have been reported worldwide. These include overdoses with oral ABILIFY alone and in combination with other substances. No fatality was reported with ABILIFY alone. The largest known dose with a known outcome involved acute ingestion of 1,260 mg of oral ABILIFY (42 times the maximum recommended daily dose) by a patient who fully recovered. Deliberate or accidental overdosage was also reported in children (age 12 years and younger) involving oral ABILIFY ingestions up to 195 mg with no fatalities.[L45859]  \r\n\r\nCommon adverse reactions (reported in at least 5% of all overdose cases) reported with oral ABILIFY overdosage (alone or in combination with other substances) include vomiting, somnolence, and tremor. Other clinically important signs and symptoms observed in one or more patients with ABILIFY overdoses (alone or with other substances) include acidosis, aggression, aspartate aminotransferase increased, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, coma, confusional state, convulsion, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, depressed level of consciousness, hypertension, hypokalemia, hypotension, lethargy, loss of consciousness, QRS complex prolonged, QT prolonged, pneumonia aspiration, respiratory arrest, status epilepticus, and tachycardia.[L45859] \r\n\r\nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with ABILIFY. An electrocardiogram should be obtained in case of overdosage and if QT interval prolongation is present, cardiac monitoring should be instituted. Otherwise, management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.[L45859]  \r\n_Charcoal_: In the event of an overdose of ABILIFY, an early charcoal administration may be useful in partially preventing the absorption of aripiprazole. Administration of 50 g of activated charcoal, one hour after a single 15 mg oral dose of ABILIFY, decreased the mean AUC and C<sub>max</sub> of aripiprazole by 50%.[L45859] \r\n_Hemodialysis_: Although there is no information on the effect of hemodialysis in treating an overdose with ABILIFY, hemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.[L45859]  \r\n\r\nLifetime carcinogenicity studies were conducted in ICR mice, F344 rats, and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Aripiprazole was administered for 2 years in the diet at doses of 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day to ICR mice and 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day to F344 rats (0.2, 0.5, 2 and 5 times and 0.3, 1 and 3 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area, respectively). In addition, SD rats were dosed orally for 2 years at 10, 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg/day, which are 3, 6, 13 and 19 times the MRHD based on mg/m2 body surface area. Aripiprazole did not induce tumors in male mice or male rats. In female mice, the incidences of pituitary gland adenomas and mammary gland adenocarcinomas and adenoacanthomas were increased at dietary doses of 3 to 30 mg/kg/day (0.5 to 5 times the MRHD). In female rats, the incidence of mammary gland fibroadenomas was increased at a dietary dose of 10 mg/kg/day (3 times the MRHD); and the incidences of adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/carcinomas were increased at an oral dose of 60 mg/kg/day (19 times the MRHD).[L45859] \r\n\r\nAn increase in mammary, pituitary, and endocrine pancreas neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is considered to be mediated by prolonged dopamine D2-receptor antagonism and hyperprolactinemia. Serum prolactin was not measured in the aripiprazole carcinogenicity studies. However, increases in serum prolactin levels were observed in female mice in a 13 week dietary study at the doses associated with mammary gland and pituitary tumors. Serum prolactin was not increased in female rats in 4 week and 13 week dietary studies at the dose associated with mammary gland tumors. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unclear.[L45859]\r\n\r\nThe mutagenic potential of aripiprazole was tested in the in vitro bacterial reverse-mutation assay, the in vitro bacterial DNA repair assay, the in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells, the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells, the in vivo micronucleus assay in mice, and the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in rats. Aripiprazole and a metabolite (2,3-DCPP) were clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in CHL cells with and without metabolic activation. The metabolite, 2,3-DCPP, increased numerical aberrations in the in vitro assay in CHL cells in the absence of metabolic activation. A positive response was obtained in the in vivo micronucleus assay in mice; however, the response was due to a mechanism not considered relevant to humans.[L45859] \r\n\r\nFemale rats were treated orally with aripiprazole from 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation Day 7 at doses of 2, 6, and 20 mg/kg/day, which are 0.6, 2, and 6 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area. Estrus cycle irregularities and increased corpora lutea were seen at all doses, but no impairment of fertility was seen. Increased pre-implantation loss was seen at 2 and 6 times the MRHD, and decreased fetal weight was seen at 6 times the MRHD.[L45859] \r\n\r\nMale rats were treated orally with aripiprazole from 9 weeks prior to mating through mating at doses of 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg/day, which are 6, 13, and 19 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area. Disturbances in spermatogenesis were seen at 19 times the MRHD and prostate atrophy was seen at 13 and 19 times the MRHD without impairment of fertility.[L45859] \r\n\r\n\r\nPharmacokinetic properties in patients 10-17 years of age are similar to that of adults once body weight has been corrected for. No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients however aripiprazole is not approved for Alzheimer's associated psychosis. Patients classified as CYP2D6 poor metabolizers should be prescribed half the regular dose of aripiprazole.

Many studies have found no effects on fetal development associated with long-term use of contraceptive doses of oral progestins. Studies of infant growth and development that have been conducted have not demonstrated significant adverse effects, however, these studies are few in number. It is therefore advisable to rule out suspected pregnancy before starting any hormonal contraceptive [F3904]. \r\n\r\n**Effects on fertility**\r\n\r\nProgesterone at high doses is an antifertility drug and high doses would be expected to impair fertility until cessation [F3916]. The progesterone contraceptive should not be used during pregnancy. \r\n\r\n**Carcinogenicity**\r\n\r\nProgesterone has been shown to induce or promote the formation of ovarian, uterine, mammary, and genital tract tumors in animals. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown [F3913]. Certain epidemiological studies of patients using oral contraceptives have reported an increased relative risk of developing breast cancer, especially at a younger age and associated with a longer duration of use. These studies have mainly involved combined oral contraceptives, and therefore, it is unknown whether this risk is attributable to progestins, estrogens, or a combination of both. At this time, there is insufficient data to determine whether the use of progestin-only contraceptives increases the risk in a similar way to combined contraceptives. A meta-analysis of 54 studies showed a small increase in the frequency of breast cancer diagnosis for women who were currently using combined oral contraceptives, or had used them within the past 10 years. There was no increase in the frequency of having breast cancer diagnosed ten or more years after cessation of hormone use. Women with breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives, as there is no sufficient data to fully establish or negate the risk of cancer with hormonal contraceptive use [F3904]. \r\n\r\n**Use in breastfeeding**\r\n\r\nProgesterone has been detected in the milk of nursing mothers [F3901], [F3904]. No adverse effects, in general, have been found on breastfeeding ability or on the health, growth, or development of the growing infant. Despite this, isolated post-marketing cases of decreased milk production have been reported [F3904].

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as paritaprevir. As a newer generation and directly acting HCV antiviral, paritaprevir products have better Sustained Virological Response (SVR) rates, higher barriers to resistance, fewer side effects, and a reduced pill burden compared to older agents such as [DB08873], [DB05521], [DB00008], [DB00022], and [DB00811]. By combining multiple antiretroviral medications into fixed dose products, the viral lifecycle can be targeted at multiple stages while simultaneously reducing the risk of developing resistant viral strains [A19593]. Within Canada and the United States, paritaprevir is currently available in three fixed dose products: Viekira Pak (FDA), Technivie (FDA and Health Canada), and Holkira Pak (Health Canada).\r\n\r\nMore specifically, paritaprevir prevents viral replication by inhibiting the NS3/4A serine protease of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) [FDA Label]. Following viral replication of HCV genetic material and translation into a single polypeptide, Nonstructural Protein 3 (NS3) and its activating cofactor Nonstructural Protein 4A (NS4A) are responsible for cleaving genetic material into the following structural and nonstructural proteins required for assembly into mature virus: NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B [A19643]. By inhibiting viral protease NS3/4A, paritaprevir therefore prevents viral replication and function. \r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Paritaprevir as a first line therapy option when used in combination with other antivirals for genotypes 1a, 1b, and 4[L852]. Depending on the genotype, Paritaprevir is often used in combination with other antivirals such as [DB09296], [DB09183], [DB00503], and [DB00811], with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as paritaprevir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635]. \r\n\r\nParitaprevir first came on the market as a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09296], [DB09183], and [DB00503] as the FDA-approved product Viekira Pak. First approved in December 2014, Viekira Pak is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1b without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, and when combined with [DB00811] for the treatment of HCV genotype 1a without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.\r\n\r\nParitaprevir is also available as a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09296] and [DB00503] as the FDA- and Health Canada-approved product Technivie. First approved in July 2015, Technivie is indicated in combination with [DB00811] for the treatment of patients with genotype 4 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, paritaprevir is also available as a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09296], [DB09183], and [DB00503] as the Health Canada-approved, commercially available product Holkira Pak.

The evidence supporting statin use, coupled with minimal side effects and long term benefits, has resulted in wide use of this medication in North America.[A181087, A181406]\r\n\r\nAtorvastatin and other statins including [lovastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line treatment options for dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] The increasing use of this class of drugs is largely attributed to the rise in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (such as heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke) in many countries.[A181084] An elevated cholesterol level (elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) is a significant risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Several landmark studies demonstrate that the use of statins is associated with both a reduction in LDL levels and CVD risk.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins were shown to reduce the incidences of all-cause mortality, including fatal and non-fatal CVD, as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Some evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within five years) statin use leads to a 20%-22% relative reduction in the number of major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]\r\n\r\nAtorvastatin was first synthesized in 1985 by Dr. Bruce Roth and approved by the FDA in 1996.[T568] It is a pentasubstituted pyrrole [A177415] formed by two contrasting moieties with an achiral heterocyclic core unit and a 3,5-dihydroxypentanoyl side chain identical to its parent compound.[T571] Unlike other members of the statin group, atorvastatin is an active compound and therefore does not require activation.[A177436]'}, {'name': None, 'simmilarity score': array([0.9927696]), 'approval status': None, 'average mass': None, 'toxicity': None, 'descriptions': None}, {'name': 'Rosuvastatin', 'simmilarity score': array([0.99233449]), 'approval status': 'approved', 'average mass': 481.538, 'toxicity': 'Generally well-tolerated.

', 'descriptions': 'Rosuvastatin, also known as the brand name product Crestor, is a lipid-lowering drug that belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage elevated lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes.

Vestibular toxicity may cause vertigo, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and loss of balance.[F1949,Label]\r\n\r\n**Neuromuscular blockade**\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, amikacin may exacerbate neuromuscular blockade, however, this is less common.[Label,L4680]\r\n\r\n**Use in Pregnancy**\r\n\r\nCategory D. Gentamicin and other aminoglycosides are known to cross the placenta. There is evidence of selective uptake of gentamicin by the fetal kidney resulting in damage to immature nephrons. Eighth cranial nerve damage has also been reported after in-utero exposure to some of the aminoglycosides. Because of the chemical similarity, all aminoglycosides should be considered potentially nephrotoxic and ototoxic to the developing fetus. Therapeutic blood amikacin levels in the mother do not equate with safety for the fetus. In reproductive toxicity studies in mice and rats, no effects on fertility or fetal toxicity were observed.[F1949]\r\n\r\n**Use in Lactation**\r\n\r\nIt is not known whether amikacin is excreted in breast milk. Since the possible harmful effect on the infant is not known, it is recommended that if nursing mothers must be given amikacin, the infants should not be breastfed during therapy.[F1949]', 'descriptions': ""Amikacin is a semi-synthetic aminoglycoside antibiotic that is derived from kanamycin A.[FDA label] Amikacin is synthesized by acylation with the l-(-)-γ-amino-α-hydroxybutyryl side chain at the C-1 amino group of the deoxystreptamine moiety of kanamycin A.[A39531]\r\n\r\nAmikacin's unique property is that it exerts activity against more resistant gram-negative bacilli such as Acinetobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Amikacin also exerts excellent activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacilli from the Enterobacteriaceae family, including Nocardia and some Mycobacterium (M. avium-intracellulare, M. chelonae, and M. fortuitum)[L4680]. M. avium-intracellulare (MAC) is a type of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) found in water and soil.

It belongs to the meglitinide class of short-acting insulin secretagogues, which act by binding to β cells of the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Nateglinide is an amino acid derivative that induces an early insulin response to meals decreasing postprandial blood glucose levels. It should only be taken with meals and meal-time doses should be skipped with any skipped meal. Approximately one month of therapy is required before a decrease in fasting blood glucose is seen. Meglitnides may have a neutral effect on weight or cause a slight increase in weight. The average weight gain caused by meglitinides appears to be lower than that caused by sulfonylureas and insulin and appears to occur only in those naïve to oral antidiabetic agents. Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones.

It belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage abnormal lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]\r\n\r\nSimvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]\r\n\r\nWhile all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while simvastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of ~35%.[A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Potency is thought to correlate to tissue permeability as the more lipophilic statins such as simvastatin are thought to enter endothelial cells by passive diffusion, as opposed to hydrophilic statins such as [pravastatin] and [rosuvastatin] which are taken up into hepatocytes through OATP1B1 (organic anion transporter protein 1B1)-mediated transport.[A181424,A181460] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181427]'}, {'name': 'Fluocinonide', 'simmilarity score': array([0.99394697]), 'approval status': 'approved', 'average mass': 494.5249, 'toxicity': 'Side effects may include acne-like eruptions, burning, dryness, excessive hair growth, infection of the skin, irritation, itching, lack of skin colour, prickly heat, skin inflammation, skin loss or softening, stretch marks.', 'descriptions': 'A topical glucocorticoid used in the treatment of eczema.'}, {'name': None, 'simmilarity score': array([0.99300253]), 'approval status': None, 'average mass': None, 'toxicity': None, 'descriptions': None}]","[{'name': 'Anecortave acetate', 'simmilarity score': array([0.98986983]), 'approval status': 'not_approved', 'average mass': 386.4813, 'toxicity': '', 'descriptions': 'Anecortave acetate (Retaane) is an analog of cortisol acetate; among the modifications to the steroid are the removal of the 11ß hydroxyl OH group and an addition of a 21-acetate group.

Dasabuvir is a non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitor which binds to the palm domain of NS5B and induces a conformational change which renders the polymerase unable to elongate viral RNA [FDA Label]. The binding sites for non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitors are poorly conserved across HCV genotypes leading to the restriction of Dasabuvir's use to genotype 1 only.\r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Dasabuvir as first line therapy in combination with [DB09296], [DB09297], and [DB00503] for genotype 1b and with [DB00811] for genotype 1a of Hepatitis C [L852]. Dasabuvir, [DB09296], [DB09297], [DB00503], and [DB00811] are used with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].\r\n\r\nDasabuvir is available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB09296], [DB09297], and [DB00503] (tradename Viekira Pak) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in December 2014 by the FDA, Viekira Pak is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1a with [DB00811] or genotype 1b without [DB00811] [FDA Label]. When combined together, Dasabuvir [DB09296], [DB09297], and [DB00503] as the combination product Viekira Pak have been shown to achieve a SVR of 100% for genotype 1b and 89% or 95% for genotype 1a after 12 weeks or 24 weeks of treatment including [DB00811].""}, {'name': None, 'simmilarity score': array([0.51966208]), 'approval status': None, 'average mass': None, 'toxicity': None, 'descriptions': None}]","[{'name': 'Sarizotan', 'simmilarity score': array([0.72980201]), 'approval status': 'not_approved', 'average mass': 348.421, 'toxicity': '', 'descriptions': ''}, {'name': 'Saroglitazar', 'simmilarity score': array([0.68432415]), 'approval status': 'not_approved', 'average mass': 439.57, 'toxicity': '', 'descriptions': 'Saroglitazar has been investigated for the treatment of Fatty Liver.'}, {'name': 'Dinaciclib', 'simmilarity score': array([0.62777239]), 'approval status': 'not_approved', 'average mass': 396.495, 'toxicity': '', 'descriptions': 'Dinaciclib has been used in trials studying the treatment of rrMM, rrCLL, rrDLBCL, Solid Tumors, and Solid Neoplasm, among others.'}, {'name': 'Enecadin', 'simmilarity score': array([0.62195206]), 'approval status': 'not_approved', 'average mass': 357.473, 'toxicity': '', 'descriptions': 'Enecadin has been investigated for the treatment of Stroke.'}, {'name': 'Palovarotene', 'simmilarity score': array([0.61213136]), 'approval status': 'approved', 'average mass': 414.549, 'toxicity': 'Palovarotene is contraindicated during pregnancy.

In a female rat fertility study, palovarotene was orally administered to females for 14 days prior to mating with drug naïve males and up to GD 7 at the dose levels of 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/day.

Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Telaprevir. Telaprevir is an inhibitor of NS3/4A, a serine protease enzyme, encoded by HCV genotype 1 [FDA Label]. These enzymes are essential for viral replication and serve to cleave the virally encoded polyprotein into mature proteins like NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B. The barrier for develoment of resistance to NS3/4A inhibitors is lower than that of NS5B inhibitors, another class of DAAs [A19593]. Subtitutions at amino acid positions 155, 156, or 168 are known to confer resistance. The substitutions of the enzyme's catalytic triad consisting of H58, D82, and S139 are also likely to alter the affinity of the drug for NS3/4A or the activity of the enzyme itself.

It is similar in structure to anthracyclines such as mitoxantrone, but exerts fewer toxic effects on cardiac tissue. [2] The lower cardio-toxic effects of pixantrone may be explained, in part, by its redox inactivity [3]. Pixantrone does not bind iron and promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species to a lesser degree than other anthracyclines. It also inhibits doxorubicinol formation in human myocardium. [3] As a result, it is believed to be less cardiotoxic while still exerting efficacy.  \r\n\r\nPixantrone was designed to treat relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma(NHL) in patients who have failed two prior lines of therapy. [2] For patients suffering from NHL, first line therapies consist of anthracycline containing multi-drug treatments which unfortunately are known to cause irreversible myocardial tissue damage. Patients refractory to treatment, or those who relapse, are discouraged from further anthracycline use due to cumulative cardiotoxicity. Pixantrone dimaleate, administered intravenously, was designed by Cell Therapeutics Incorporated as an alternative second line therapy in refractory or relapsed NHL. It is currently being tested in Phase III trials. [2]\r\n\r\nAlthough pixantrone has not yet received FDA approval in the United States, it has been granted conditional marketing approval by the European Union. Conditional approval was granted by the European Medicines Agency after a phase III EXTEND trial of patients with NHL showed that pixantrone was tolerable and that it resulted in significantly higher complete response rate and progression free survival in comparison to other single chemotherapy agents. However, it is notable that the EXTEND trial was stopped early, leaving the statistical significance of the results in question. Based on this uncertainty, in 2009, the FDA ultimately rejected Cell Therapeutic's initial application for accelerated approval for pixantrone use in relapsed or refractory NHL. Another phase III trial, PIX-R, is now ongoing to clarify pixantrones place in therapy. It will compare pixantrone efficacy to that of gemcitabine.

Intraperitoneal and subcutaneous LD<sub>50</sub> in mice are 191 mg/kg and 320 mg/kg, respectively.[MSDS] In placebo-controlled trials, there were increased incidences of mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis receiving antipsychotic medications. The risk of death in drug-treated patients was about 1.6 to 1.7 times that of placebo-treated patients. Deaths were largely resulting from cardiovascular, such as heart failure and sudden death, or infectious, such as pneumonia, conditions.[label] Due to its antagonist action on dopamine receptors, prochlorperazine is associated with a risk for developing extrapyramidal symptoms such as tardive dyskinesia, which is a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. This risk is also conferred on other antipsychotic agents that block dopamine receptors. It is proposed that increased duration of the drug treatment is likely thus increased total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient leads to increased risk for developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversible. As with other antipsychotic agents, prochlorperazine is associated with a risk for causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which is a potentially fatal symptom complex, which is manifested as hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability. \r\n\r\nThere is no known antidote for prochlorperazine thus overdose treatment should be supportive and symptomatic. Overdose of prochlorperazine may produce dystonic reactions that involve extrapyramidal mechanism. To reduce these symptoms, antiparkinsonism drugs, barbiturates, or diphenhydramine may be used. Symptoms of central nervous system depression, such as somnolence or coma, may also be observed. Amphetamine, destroamphetamine, or caffeine and sodium benzoate may be used to induce stimulatory effects. In contrast, agitation and restlessness may also be seen in case of overdose. Other possible manifestations include convulsions, EKG changes and cardiac arrhythmias, fever, and autonomic reactions such as hypotension, dry mouth and ileus. Hypotension can be responded with the standard measures for managing circulatory shock.[label] \r\n\r\n**Nonclinical Toxicology**\r\n\r\nIn a rat developmental or reproductive toxicity study, abnormalities in both the reproductive measures and neurobehavioral testing were observed following administration of 25 mg/kg of prochlorperazine.[L6649] \r\n\r\n**Use in specific populations**\r\n\r\nAs the use of antipsychotic agents during the third trimester of pregnancy is associated with a risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery, the use of prochlorperazine in pregnant patients is generally not recommended and it should be limited after careful consideration of the potential benefit of drug therapy justifying the potential risk to the fetus.

The most common adverse reactions are headache and fatigue. The FDA Label currently warns of a risk of symptomatic bradycardia when Epclusa is used in combination with amiodarone [FDA Label]. ', 'descriptions': ""Sofosbuvir (tradename Sovaldi) is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as sofosbuvir. As a prodrug nucleotide analog, Sofosbuvir is metabolized into its active form as the antiviral agent 2'-deoxy-2'-α-fluoro-β-C-methyluridine-5'-triphosphate (also known as GS-461203), which acts as a defective substrate for NS5B (non-structural protein 5B) [synthesis]. NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is essential for the transcription of Hepatitis C viral RNA and for its high replicative rate and genetic diversity [A19594]. Sofosbuvir and other direct acting antivirals are therefore very potent options for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as they exhibit a high barrier to the development of resistance [A19593]. This is an important advantage relative to HCV drugs that target other viral enzymes such as the protease, for which rapid development of resistance has proven to be an important cause of therapeutic failure.  \r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Sofosbuvir as first line therapy in combination with other antivirals for all six genotypes of Hepatitis C [L852]. Depending on the genotype, sofosbuvir is often used in combination with other antivirals such as [DB09027], [DB11613], [DB09102], [DB06290], [DB11574], [DB11575], [DB00811], [DB00008], or [DB00022] with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as sofosbuvir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon- and ribavirin-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635]. \r\n\r\nSince 2014, sofosbuvir has been available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB09027] (tradename Harvoni) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in October 2014 by the FDA, Harvoni is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 with or without [DB00811] depending on the level of liver damage or cirrhosis [FDA Label].  When combined together, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as the combination product Harvoni has been shown to achieve a SVR between 93 and 99% after 12 weeks of treatment [A7535]. Its use has also proven successful in the treatment of HCV in patients co-infected with HIV [A19627].\r\n\r\nSofosbuvir is also available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB11613] as the commercially available product Epclusa. First approved in June 2016, Epclusa is the first combination HCV product indicated for the treatment of all genotypes of Hepatitis C with or without cirrhosis. Epclusa is also currently the most potent HCV antiviral medication on the market with a sustained virologic response (SVR) after 12 weeks of therapy of 93-99% depending on genotype and level of cirrhosis [L852]. Both Canadian and American guidelines list Epclusa as a first line recommendation for all genotypes of HCV [L852, A19626].\r\n\r\nNotably, sofosbuvir has come under intense scrutiny since its release to market in 2013. With the price per pill set at $1000, a 12-week treatment can cost upwards of $84,000 per patient [A19636].""}, {'name': 'TMP', 'simmilarity score': array([0.95333791]), 'approval status': 'not_approved', 'average mass': 338.2079, 'toxicity': '', 'descriptions': ''}, {'name': None, 'simmilarity score': array([0.94816393]), 'approval status': None, 'average mass': None, 'toxicity': None, 'descriptions': None}, {'name': 'Telithromycin', 'simmilarity score': array([0.94447541]), 'approval status': 'approved', 'average mass': 812.018, 'toxicity': 'LD50>2000 mg/kg (PO in rats).

Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]\r\n\r\nLovastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]\r\n\r\nWhile all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while lovastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of 25-40%.[A174580,A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Potency is thought to correlate to tissue permeability as the more lipophilic statins such as lovastatin are thought to enter endothelial cells by passive diffusion, as opposed to hydrophilic statins such as [pravastatin] and [rosuvastatin] which are taken up into hepatocytes through OATP1B1 (organic anion transporter protein 1B1)-mediated transport.[A181424,A181460] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181538, A181427]'}, {'name': 'Hydroxyprogesterone caproate', 'simmilarity score': array([0.99081737]), 'approval status': 'approved', 'average mass': 428.6041, 'toxicity': 'Injection site pain is the most common adverse effect associated with hydroxyprogesterone caproate.

Aaron B. Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958.  In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and lowering the body temperature.  Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood, learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant.  Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Reduced melatonin production has also been proposed as a likely factor in the significantly higher cancer rates in night workers.'}, {'name': 'Ramipril', 'simmilarity score': array([0.9703902]), 'approval status': 'approved', 'average mass': 416.5106, 'toxicity': 'Symptoms of overdose may include excessive peripheral vasodilation (with marked hypotension and shock), bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances, and renal failure.

In clinical trials, cases of acute ingestions up to 1000 mg daily were reported with none being fatal [F3925]. In postmarketing experience, fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses primarily involving multiple drugs but also with milnacipran only [F3925]. The most common signs and symptoms of overdose included increased blood pressure, cardio-respiratory arrest, changes in the level of consciousness (ranging from somnolence to coma), confusional state, dizziness, and increased hepatic enzymes [F3919, F3922, F3925].\r\n\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women [F3919, F3922, F3925]. In fact, milnacipram should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus [F3919, F3922, F3925].\r\n\r\nNeonates exposed to SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding [F3919, F3922, F3925]. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying [F3919, F3922, F3925]. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SNRI class drugs like milnacipran or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome [F3919, F3922, F3925]. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [F3919, F3922, F3925].\r\n\r\nThe effect of milnacipran on labor and delivery in humans is unknown [F3919, F3922, F3925]. Milnacipran should be used during labor and delivery only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks [F3919, F3922, F3925].\r\n\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in nursing mothers [F3919, F3922, F3925]. It is not known if milnacipran is excreted in human milk [F3919, F3922, F3925]. Studies have shown that levomilnacipran is excreted into the milk of lactating rats [F3919, F3922, F3925]. Subsequently, possible excretion into human milk possesses the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants [F3919, F3922, F3925]. As a consequence, breastfeeding by women treated with levomilnacipran should be considered only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the child [F3919, F3922, F3925].\r\n\r\nMilnacipran is not indicated for use in children under 18 years of age due to concerns over the potential for agitation-type emotional and behavioral changes, as well as suicidal ideation and/or behavior [F3919, F3922, F3925].\r\n\r\nSNRIs like milnacipran have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event [F3919, F3922, F3925].\r\n\r\nLevomilnacipran was not mutagenic when evaluated in vitro in a bacterial mutagenicity study (Ames test) and not genotoxic in a mouse lymphoma study [F3919, F3922, F3925]. It was not clastogenic in an in vivo micronucleus assay in rats [F3919, F3922, F3925].\r\n\r\nThe potential effects of levomilnacipran on gonadal function, mating behavior, reproductive performance and early pregnancy were evaluated in rats at oral doses of 0, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/day [F3919, F3922, F3925]. The NOAEL was 100 mg/kg/day based on reductions in body weight gain and food consumption [F3919, F3922, F3925]. There were no levomilnacipran effects on male and female fertility parameters [F3919, F3922, F3925].\r\n\r\nIn the rat and rabbit embryo/fetal development studies, decreases in maternal body weight gain and food consumption were noted [F3919, F3922, F3925]. In the fetuses, increases in the incidence of ossification anomalies were noted but were of no toxicological significance [F3919, F3922, F3925]. In both species, the NOAEL was determined to be 100 mg/kg/day, a dose which represents a rat or rabbit animal-to-human exposure margin of 9-fold and 4-fold, respectively relative to the human exposure from 120 mg/day of levomilnacipran [F3919, F3922, F3925].    \r\n \r\nMaterial safety data for milnacipran has documented the LD50 oral value in the rat model as being 213 mg/kg [MSDS].', 'descriptions': ""Milnacipran is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) and like many agents in this category was originally developed for and continues to be approved and indicated for the treatment of depression [F3928, F3934, A175786, A175951]. Furthermore, in 2009 the US FDA approved milnacipran for the additional indication of treating fibromyalgia [F3925], although other regional regulatory authorities like the EMA, among others, have not yet approved the agent for such treatment, citing lack of robust evidence of efficacy, insufficient demonstration of maintenance of effect, and other concerns [F3928, F3934]. Nevertheless, milnacipran demonstrates a somewhat unique characteristic among SNRIs to elicit a relatively balanced reuptake inhibition of both serotonin and noradrenaline, with a somewhat increased preference for noradrenaline reuptake inhibition - which is potentially a point of interest given the plausible proposal that noradrenaline plays an important role in the mitigation of pain signals in the descending inhibitory pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord [A175759, A175843, A175846].\r\n\r\nMoreover, recent research has shown that the levorotatory enantiomer of milnacipran, levomilnacipran, may have the capacity to inhibit the activity of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1), which has investigationally been associated with β-amyloid plaque formation - making the agent a possible course of treatment for Alzheimer's disease [A175957].""}]","[{'name': 'Indole-3-carbinol', 'simmilarity score': array([0.96886981]), 'approval status': 'not_approved', 'average mass': 147.1739, 'toxicity': '', 'descriptions': 'Indole 3 Carbinol is under investigation in clinical trial NCT00033345 (Indole-3-Carbinol in Preventing Breast Cancer in Nonsmoking Women Who Are at High Risk For Breast Cancer).'}, {'name': 'Lonidamine', 'simmilarity score': array([0.96815878]), 'approval status': 'not_approved', 'average mass': 321.158, 'toxicity': '', 'descriptions': 'Lonidamine (LND) is a drug that interferes with energy metabolism of cancer cells, principally inhibiting aerobic glycolytic activity, by its effect on mitochondrially-bound hexokinase (HK).

Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as paritaprevir. As a newer generation and directly acting HCV antiviral, paritaprevir products have better Sustained Virological Response (SVR) rates, higher barriers to resistance, fewer side effects, and a reduced pill burden compared to older agents such as [DB08873], [DB05521], [DB00008], [DB00022], and [DB00811]. By combining multiple antiretroviral medications into fixed dose products, the viral lifecycle can be targeted at multiple stages while simultaneously reducing the risk of developing resistant viral strains [A19593]. Within Canada and the United States, paritaprevir is currently available in three fixed dose products: Viekira Pak (FDA), Technivie (FDA and Health Canada), and Holkira Pak (Health Canada).\r\n\r\nMore specifically, paritaprevir prevents viral replication by inhibiting the NS3/4A serine protease of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) [FDA Label].

Target organs for neoplastic changes were the kidneys (renal tubule and renal pelvis), urinary bladder, urethra, preputial and clitoral gland, small intestine, parathyroid glands, adrenal glands, and non-glandular stomach. Neoplastic lesions were not seen at 30 mg/kg/day for the kidneys, urinary bladder, urethra, small intestine, parathyroid glands, adrenal glands, and non-glandular stomach, and 15 mg/kg/day for the preputial and clitoral gland.

This result contrasts with the finding in a planned 1-year dog study that was prematurely terminated because of deaths associated with convulsions in dogs receiving as little as 0.5mg/kg/day. The earliest deaths, however, occurred at 56 days in dogs receiving 2mg/kg/day. The unusual vulnerability of the dog is not understood; it is hypothesised, however, that the explanation lies in the fact that the dog differs markedly from other species (including humans) in its metabolism of Nabilone.', 'descriptions': ""Nabilone (marketed as Cesamet) is a synthetic form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ⁹-THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis (marijuana). Although structurally distinct from THC, nabilone mimics THC's structure and pharmacological activity through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, however it is considered to be twice as active as Δ⁹-THC. Nabilone is approved by the FDA for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nTetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body [A32830]. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms like Nabilone or [DB00470]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.\r\n\r\nFrom a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (via the Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 and CB2) and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others [A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. CB2 receptors are mainly located in the peripheral nervous system and can be found on lymphoid tissue where they are involved in regulation of immune function [A32676].\r\n\r\nIn Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Mexico, nabilone is marketed as Cesamet. It was approved in 1985 by the United States FDA for treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting that has not responded to conventional antiemetics. Though it was approved by the FDA in 1985, the drug only began marketing in the United States in 2006.

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Dasabuvir. Dasabuvir is a non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitor which binds to the palm domain of NS5B and induces a conformational change which renders the polymerase unable to elongate viral RNA [FDA Label]. The binding sites for non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitors are poorly conserved across HCV genotypes leading to the restriction of Dasabuvir's use to genotype 1 only.\r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Dasabuvir as first line therapy in combination with [DB09296], [DB09297], and [DB00503] for genotype 1b and with [DB00811] for genotype 1a of Hepatitis C [L852].

Many studies have found no effects on fetal development associated with long-term use of contraceptive doses of oral progestins.

At this time, there is insufficient data to determine whether the use of progestin-only contraceptives increases the risk in a similar way to combined contraceptives. A meta-analysis of 54 studies showed a small increase in the frequency of breast cancer diagnosis for women who were currently using combined oral contraceptives, or had used them within the past 10 years. There was no increase in the frequency of having breast cancer diagnosed ten or more years after cessation of hormone use.

', 'descriptions': 'Rosuvastatin, also known as the brand name product Crestor, is a lipid-lowering drug that belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage elevated lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]\r\n\r\nRosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]\r\n\r\nWhile all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]\'s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.\r\n\r\nRosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]'}, {'name': 'Olopatadine', 'simmilarity score': array([0.98880017]), 'approval status': 'approved', 'average mass': 337.4122, 'toxicity': 'Based on the findings of an acute toxicity study in animals, the oral LD<sub>50</sub> of olopatadine was >1150 mg/kg in mice and >3870 mg/kg in rats.[L6790] The Lowest published toxic dose via the oral route was 20 mg/kg in rat and 0.1 mg/kg in mouse.[MSDS]\r\n\r\nThere are no known reports on overdosage following oral, ophthalmic, or intranasal administration of olopatadine.

', 'descriptions': ""Simeprevir is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease inhibitor indicated in patient's with HCV genotype 1 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Like all NS3/4A inhibitors, simeprevir is a serine protease inhibitor in similarity to [DB08873] and [DB05521] but is classified as a second generation protease inhibitor. This class of antiviral drugs were the first direct acting antivirals approved but are associated with lower cure rates than newer drugs. Broad use of simeprevir occurred when it was used in combination with a newer drug, [DB08934]. Inhibiting HCV NS3/4A protease in a potent and highly specific manner, simeprevir is a direct-acting antiviral agent against the hepatitis C virus. Since the viral protease NS3/4A complex is essential for cleaving the HCV encoded polyprotein into individual viral proteins facilitating replication [A19632], the drug blocks the viral replication process. It is shown to display synergistic effects with interferon-α and HCV NS5B inhibitor, and additive effects with ribavirin in HCV replicon cells [A19629]. Unlike first generation serine protease inhibitors, simprevir has a sightly different resistance profile where limited therapeutic efficacy of the drug is observed with NS3 Q80K polymorphic variants and simeprevir-specific amino acid position of 168 also results in higher treatment failure rates [A19630]. The observed prevalence of the N3 Q80K polymorphism was 30% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1a and 0.5% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1b [A19630]. \r\n\r\nAccording to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), simeprevir can be used as first-line or second-line threapies for treatment-naïve patients as adjunct to sofosbuvir treatment for genotype 1 or PEG-Interferon/ribavirin combination therapy for genotype 1 or 4. The combination therapy of simeprevir and other antiviral agents are initiated in HCV-positive patients with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].\r\n\r\nSimeprevir was approved by the FDA in November 2014 and is marketed under the brand name Olysio as oral tablets. Administered once daily with food, 150mg simeprevir capsule is used in combination with [DB08934] in patients with HCV genotype 1 without cirrhosis for 12 week duration. In patients with HCV genotype 1 with compensated cirrhosis, the treatment is directed for 24 week duration. Sustained virologic response 12 weeks after planned end of treatment (SVR12) was achieved in 170/176 (97%) subjects without cirrhosis treated with 12 weeks simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir (FDA Label). The overall SVR12 was 88% (44/50) in treatment-naïve patients with cirrhosis [L852].\r\n\r\nSimeprevir is also used in treatment of HCV genotype 4 patients with or without cirrhosis and is taken with [DB00008] and [DB00811]; this triple therapy allows shortening treatment duration from 48 weeks or longer to 12 or 24 weeks [A19630] depending on prior response status and presence of HIV-1 co-infection. Prior to initiation of treatment with [DB00008] and [DB00811], screening for the presence of virus with the NS3 Q80K polymorphism is strongly recommended and if detected, alternative treatment should be considered instead to prevent therapeutic failure. The SVR12 was 83% (29/35) in treatment-naïve patients and 86% (19/22) in relapsing patients.""}, {'name': None, 'simmilarity score': array([0.924999]), 'approval status': None, 'average mass': None, 'toxicity': None, 'descriptions': None}, {'name': None, 'simmilarity score': array([0.91760135]), 'approval status': None, 'average mass': None, 'toxicity': None, 'descriptions': None}, {'name': 'Dotatate gallium Ga-68', 'simmilarity score': array([0.91643357]), 'approval status': 'approved', 'average mass': 1500.54, 'toxicity': 'Studies on dotatate gallium 68 have not been studied but the comparative studies to other non-radioactivity compounds showed no mutation.[FDA label]', 'descriptions': 'Dotatate gallium (Ga-68) is a somatostatin-2 receptor analog which is radiolabeled with gallium 68 as a positron-emitting radioisotope.

It is available in 200, 400, 600, or 800mg tablets that are taken once daily, with or without food. Eslicarbazepine acetate is associated with numerous side effects including dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, aphasia, lack of concentration, psychomotor retardation, speech disturbances, ataxia, depression and hyponatremia. It is recommended that patients taking eslicarbazepine acetate be monitored for suicidality.""}]","[{'name': 'Nimorazole', 'simmilarity score': array([0.97624004]), 'approval status': 'not_approved', 'average mass': 226.236, 'toxicity': '', 'descriptions': 'Nimorazole has been used in trials studying the treatment of Hypoxia, Radiotherapy, Hypoxic Modification, Gene Profile, Gene Signature, and Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma, among others.'}, {'name': 'Carfentanil', 'simmilarity score': array([0.97447467]), 'approval status': 'not_approved', 'average mass': 394.5066, 'toxicity': '', 'descriptions': 'Carfentanil or carfentanyl (Wildnil) is an analogue of the popular synthetic opioid analgesic fentanyl, and is one of the most potent opioids known (also the most potent opioid used commercially).

Intraperitoneal and subcutaneous LD<sub>50</sub> in mice are 191 mg/kg and 320 mg/kg, respectively.[MSDS] In placebo-controlled trials, there were increased incidences of mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis receiving antipsychotic medications. The risk of death in drug-treated patients was about 1.6 to 1.7 times that of placebo-treated patients. Deaths were largely resulting from cardiovascular, such as heart failure and sudden death, or infectious, such as pneumonia, conditions.[label] Due to its antagonist action on dopamine receptors, prochlorperazine is associated with a risk for developing extrapyramidal symptoms such as tardive dyskinesia, which is a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. This risk is also conferred on other antipsychotic agents that block dopamine receptors. It is proposed that increased duration of the drug treatment is likely thus increased total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient leads to increased risk for developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversible. As with other antipsychotic agents, prochlorperazine is associated with a risk for causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which is a potentially fatal symptom complex, which is manifested as hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability. \r\n\r\nThere is no known antidote for prochlorperazine thus overdose treatment should be supportive and symptomatic. Overdose of prochlorperazine may produce dystonic reactions that involve extrapyramidal mechanism. To reduce these symptoms, antiparkinsonism drugs, barbiturates, or diphenhydramine may be used. Symptoms of central nervous system depression, such as somnolence or coma, may also be observed. Amphetamine, destroamphetamine, or caffeine and sodium benzoate may be used to induce stimulatory effects. In contrast, agitation and restlessness may also be seen in case of overdose. Other possible manifestations include convulsions, EKG changes and cardiac arrhythmias, fever, and autonomic reactions such as hypotension, dry mouth and ileus.

More specifically, vortioxetine acts via the following biological mechanisms: as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) through inhibition of the serotonin transporter, as a partial agonist of the 5-HT1B receptor, an agonist of 5-HT1A, and an antagonist of the 5-HT3, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT7 receptors.

In clinical trials, cases of acute ingestions up to 1000 mg daily were reported with none being fatal [F3925]. In postmarketing experience, fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses primarily involving multiple drugs but also with milnacipran only [F3925]. The most common signs and symptoms of overdose included increased blood pressure, cardio-respiratory arrest, changes in the level of consciousness (ranging from somnolence to coma), confusional state, dizziness, and increased hepatic enzymes [F3919, F3922, F3925].\r\n\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women [F3919, F3922, F3925]. In fact, milnacipram should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus [F3919, F3922, F3925].\r\n\r\nNeonates exposed to SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding [F3919, F3922, F3925]. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying [F3919, F3922, F3925]. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SNRI class drugs like milnacipran or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome [F3919, F3922, F3925]. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [F3919, F3922, F3925].\r\n\r\nThe effect of milnacipran on labor and delivery in humans is unknown [F3919, F3922, F3925]. Milnacipran should be used during labor and delivery only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks [F3919, F3922, F3925].\r\n\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in nursing mothers [F3919, F3922, F3925]. It is not known if milnacipran is excreted in human milk [F3919, F3922, F3925]. Studies have shown that levomilnacipran is excreted into the milk of lactating rats [F3919, F3922, F3925]. Subsequently, possible excretion into human milk possesses the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants [F3919, F3922, F3925]. As a consequence, breastfeeding by women treated with levomilnacipran should be considered only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the child [F3919, F3922, F3925].\r\n\r\nMilnacipran is not indicated for use in children under 18 years of age due to concerns over the potential for agitation-type emotional and behavioral changes, as well as suicidal ideation and/or behavior [F3919, F3922, F3925].\r\n\r\nSNRIs like milnacipran have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event [F3919, F3922, F3925].\r\n\r\nLevomilnacipran was not mutagenic when evaluated in vitro in a bacterial mutagenicity study (Ames test) and not genotoxic in a mouse lymphoma study [F3919, F3922, F3925]. It was not clastogenic in an in vivo micronucleus assay in rats [F3919, F3922, F3925].\r\n\r\nThe potential effects of levomilnacipran on gonadal function, mating behavior, reproductive performance and early pregnancy were evaluated in rats at oral doses of 0, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/day [F3919, F3922, F3925]. The NOAEL was 100 mg/kg/day based on reductions in body weight gain and food consumption [F3919, F3922, F3925].

In the fetuses, increases in the incidence of ossification anomalies were noted but were of no toxicological significance [F3919, F3922, F3925]. In both species, the NOAEL was determined to be 100 mg/kg/day, a dose which represents a rat or rabbit animal-to-human exposure margin of 9-fold and 4-fold, respectively relative to the human exposure from 120 mg/day of levomilnacipran [F3919, F3922, F3925].    \r\n \r\nMaterial safety data for milnacipran has documented the LD50 oral value in the rat model as being 213 mg/kg [MSDS].', 'descriptions': ""Milnacipran is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) and like many agents in this category was originally developed for and continues to be approved and indicated for the treatment of depression [F3928, F3934, A175786, A175951]. Furthermore, in 2009 the US FDA approved milnacipran for the additional indication of treating fibromyalgia [F3925], although other regional regulatory authorities like the EMA, among others, have not yet approved the agent for such treatment, citing lack of robust evidence of efficacy, insufficient demonstration of maintenance of effect, and other concerns [F3928, F3934]. Nevertheless, milnacipran demonstrates a somewhat unique characteristic among SNRIs to elicit a relatively balanced reuptake inhibition of both serotonin and noradrenaline, with a somewhat increased preference for noradrenaline reuptake inhibition - which is potentially a point of interest given the plausible proposal that noradrenaline plays an important role in the mitigation of pain signals in the descending inhibitory pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord [A175759, A175843, A175846].\r\n\r\nMoreover, recent research has shown that the levorotatory enantiomer of milnacipran, levomilnacipran, may have the capacity to inhibit the activity of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1), which has investigationally been associated with β-amyloid plaque formation - making the agent a possible course of treatment for Alzheimer's disease [A175957].""}, {'name': 'Levomilnacipran', 'simmilarity score': array([0.98317891]), 'approval status': 'approved', 'average mass': 246.348, 'toxicity': 'The oral LD<sub>50</sub> in rats was 238 mg/kg.[L47951]\r\n\r\nThere is limited clinical experience with levomilnacipran overdose in humans.

Avoid the use of SYNDROS in pregnant women. Although there is little published data on the use of synthetic cannabinoids during pregnancy, the use of cannabis (e.g., marijuana) and the use of alcohol during pregnancy have been associated with adverse fetal/neonatal outcomes (see Clinical Considerations). Cannabinoids have been found in the umbilical cord blood of pregnant women who smoke cannabis. In animal reproduction studies, no teratogenicity was reported in mice administered dronabinol (delta-9-THC) at up to 30 times the MRHD (maximum recommended human doses) and up to 5 times the MRHD for patients with AIDS and cancer, respectively. Similar findings were reported in pregnant rats administered dronabinol at up to 5 to 20 times the MRHD and 3 times the MRHD for patients with AIDS and cancer, respectively.\r\nDecreased maternal weight gain and the number of viable pups and increased fetal mortality and early resorptions were observed in both species at doses that induced maternal toxicity. In rats, maternal administration of dronabinol from pregnancy (implantation) through weaning was associated with maternal toxicity, including mortality of pups, and adverse developmental and 10 neurodevelopmental effects on the pups at 2 to 20 times the MRHD for patients with AIDS and less than and up to 3.3 times the MRHD for patients with cancer.[L43438]\r\n\r\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.[L43438]\r\n\r\nFor mothers infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV. Because of the potential for HIV transmission (in 12 HIV-negative infants) and serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving SYNDROS. For mothers with nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, there are limited data on the presence of dronabinol in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The reported effects of inhaled cannabis transferred to the breastfeeding infant have been inconsistent and insufficient to establish causality. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for SYNDROS and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from SYNDROS or from the underlying maternal condition.[L43438] \r\n\r\nThe safety and effectiveness of SYNDROS have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychoactive effects of SYNDROS. SYNDROS contains the excipients 50% (w/w) dehydrated alcohol and 5.5% (w/w) propylene glycol. Ethanol competitively inhibits the metabolism of propylene glycol, which may lead to elevated concentrations of propylene glycol. Preterm neonates may be at increased risk of propylene glycol-associated adverse events due to\r\ndiminished ability to metabolize propylene glycol, thereby, leading to accumulation.[L43438]\r\n\r\nClinical studies of dronabinol capsules in AIDS and cancer patients did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the neuropsychiatric and postural hypotensive effects of SYNDROS. Elderly patients with dementia are at increased risk for falls as a result of their underlying disease state, which may be exacerbated by the CNS effects of somnolence and dizziness associated with\r\nSYNDROS. These patients should be monitored closely and placed on fall precautions prior to initiating SYNDROS therapy. In antiemetic studies, no difference in efficacy was apparent in patients greater than 55 years of age compared to younger\r\npatients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of falls decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, increased sensitivity to psychoactive effects, and concomitant disease or other drugs therapy.[L43438]\r\n\r\nSYNDROS contains dronabinol, the main psychoactive component in marijuana. Ingestion of high doses of dronabinol increases the risk of psychiatric adverse reactions if abused or misused, while continued administration can lead to addiction. Psychiatric adverse reactions may include psychosis, hallucinations, depersonalization, mood alteration, and paranoia. In vitro studies demonstrate that SYNDROS can be easily and effectively abused without manipulation. SYNDROS contains 50% (w/w) dehydrated alcohol. In a randomized, single-dose, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled crossover pharmacodynamic study of 43 experienced marijuana smokers, “drug liking” responses and safety of SYNDROS were compared with placebo and dronabinol in sesame oil oral capsules. Treatment arms were 10 mg and 30 mg dronabinol capsules, 10 mg and 30 mg dronabinol from= SYNDROS, and placebo oral solution and capsules. Greater “drug liking” scores were reported with the 30 mg dose, compared with the 10 mg dose, for both SYNDROS and dronabinol-containing capsules. Overall, the pharmacodynamic results from this study demonstrated no statistically significant differences in various measures of drug liking for the doses taken, though the SYNDROS results were consistently greater than those of dronabinol capsules. Similarly, observed adverse reactions were greater for SYNDROS. The pharmacodynamic and safety effects of SYNDROS following multiple doses have not been evaluated. Patients should be instructed to keep SYNDROS in a secure place out of reach of others for whom the medication has not been prescribed.[L43438] \r\n\r\nPhysical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use. Physical dependence manifests by drug class-specific withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. The appearance of a withdrawal syndrome when the administration of the drug is terminated is the only actual evidence\r\nof physical dependence. Physical dependence can develop during chronic therapy with SYNDROS and develops after chronic abuse of marijuana. A withdrawal syndrome was reported after the abrupt discontinuation of dronabinol capsules in subjects receiving dosages of 210 mg per day for 12 to 16 consecutive days. Within 12 hours after discontinuation, subjects manifested symptoms such as irritability, insomnia, and restlessness. By approximately 24 hours post-dronabinol discontinuation, withdrawal symptoms\r\nintensified to include “hot flashes”, sweating, rhinorrhea, loose stools, hiccoughs, and anorexia. These withdrawal symptoms gradually dissipated over the next 48 hours. Electroencephalographic changes consistent with the effects of drug withdrawal (hyperexcitation) were recorded in patients after abrupt dechallenge. Patients also complained of disturbed sleep for several weeks after discontinuing therapy with high dosages of dronabinol.[L43438]\r\n\r\nSigns and symptoms of dronabinol overdose include drowsiness, euphoria, heightened sensory awareness, altered time perception, reddened conjunctiva, dry mouth, tachycardia, memory impairment, depersonalization, mood alteration, urinary retention, reduced bowel motility, decreased motor coordination, lethargy, slurred speech, and postural hypotension. Patients may also experience panic reactions if they have a prior history of nervousness or anxiety and seizures may occur in patients with existing seizure disorders. It is not known if dronabinol can be removed by dialysis in cases of overdose.[L43438] \r\n', 'descriptions': ""Dronabinol (marketed as Marinol) is a synthetic form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ⁹-THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis (marijuana). THC demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, which results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes. Due to its evidence as an appetite stimulant and an anti-nauseant, Dronabinol is approved for use in anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS and for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nTetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body [A32830]. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms like Dronabinol or [DB00486]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.\r\n\r\nFrom a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (via the Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 and CB2) and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others [A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. CB2 receptors are mainly located in the peripheral nervous system and can be found on lymphoid tissue where they are involved in regulation of immune function [A32676].""}, {'name': 'Cisatracurium', 'simmilarity score': array([0.7665329]), 'approval status': 'approved', 'average mass': 929.16, 'toxicity': 'Overdosage with neuromuscular blocking agents such as cisatracurium may result in neuromuscular block beyond the time needed for surgery and anesthesia.

If complete neuromuscular blockade is evident or suspected, cholinesterase inhibitors should not be administered. The reversal of paralysis may not be sufficient to maintain a patent airway and an appropriate level of spontaneous ventilation.[L43577] \r\n\r\nThe long-term carcinogenicity of cisatracurium has not been evaluated.

However, it has a negligible effect on altering the development and progression of breast cancer itself.[label] The most common causes of osteoporosis include postmenopausal deficiency of estrogen and age-related deterioration in bone homeostasis. Due to the risk of bone fractures that may lead to morbidities and reduced quality of life, the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with the use of therapeutic agents in addition to concurrent therapies is critical. Due to the decline in estrogen levels in postmenopausal osteoporosis, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), such as estradiol, has been used to ameliorate the condition. However, due to the off-target actions by HRT, newer non-hormonal agents such as raloxifene and [tamoxifen] have been developed to reduce adverse events through selective pharmacological actions on tissue-specific therapeutic targets.[T28]\r\n\r\nThe main effects of raloxifene are to preserve the bone mineral density and decrease the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.

By inhibiting this enzyme, idelalisib induces apoptosis of malignant cells and inhibits several cell signaling pathways, including B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and C-X-C chemokine receptors type 5 and type 4 signalling, which are involved in trafficking and homing of B-cells to the lymph nodes and bone marrow. Treatment of lymphoma cells with idelalisib has been shown to result in inhibition of chemotaxis and adhesion, and reduced cell viability.'}]"

In most cases only observation of vital functions is required [F3157, F3160, L5188].\r\n\r\nExtreme overdosage may lead to coma, areflexia, cardio-respiratory depression and apnoea, requiring appropriate countermeasures (ventilation, cardiovascular support) [F3157, F3160, L5188].\r\n\r\nBenzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with severe chronic obstructive airways disease [F3157, F3160, L5188]. Severe effects in overdose also include rhabdomyolysis and hypothermia [L5188]. Overdose of benzodiazepines in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol) may be fatal and should be closely monitored [F3157].\r\n\r\nIn general, the use of diazepam in women of childbearing potential, and more specifically during known pregnancy, should be considered only when the clinical situation warrants the risk to the fetus [F3157]. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered [F3157]. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [F3157]. Patients should also be advised that if they become pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant they should communicate with their physician about the desirability of discontinuing the drug [F3157].\r\n\r\nSpecial care must be taken when diazepam is used during labor and delivery, as high single doses may produce irregularities in the fetal heart rate and hypotonia, poor sucking, hypothermia, and moderate respiratory depression in the neonates [F3157]. With newborn infants it must be remembered that the enzyme system involved in the breakdown of the drug is not yet fully developed (especially in premature infants) [F3157].\r\n\r\nDiazepam passes into breast milk [F3157]. Breastfeeding is therefore not recommended in patients receiving diazepam [F3157].\r\n\r\nSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established [F3157].\r\n\r\nIn elderly patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia or oversedation (2 mg to 2.5 mg once or twice daily, initially to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated) [F3157]. Extensive accumulation of diazepam and its major metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, has been noted following chronic administration of diazepam in healthy elderly male subjects. Metabolites of this drug are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function [F3157]. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [F3157].\r\n\r\nDecreases in clearance and protein binding, and increases in volume of distribution and half-life has been reported in patients with cirrhosis [F3157]. In such patients, a 2- to 5- fold increase in mean half-life has been reported [F3157]. Delayed elimination has also been reported for the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam [F3157].

The most common adverse reactions are headache and fatigue.', 'descriptions': 'Ledipasvir is a direct acting antiviral (DAA) medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as ledipasvir. More specifically, ledipasvir is an inhibitor of the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Non-Structural Protein 5A (NS5A), which is required for viral RNA replication and assembly of HCV virions. Although its exact mechanism of action is unknown, it is postulated to prevent hyperphosphorylation of NS5A which is required for viral protein production. It is effective against genotypes 1a, 1b, 4a, and 5a and with a lesser activity against genotypes 2a and 3a of HCV. Ledipasvir and other direct acting antivirals are very potent options for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as they exhibit a high barrier to the development of resistance [A19593]. This is an important advantage relative to HCV drugs that target other viral enzymes such as the protease, for which rapid development of resistance has proven to be an important cause of therapeutic failure.  \r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend ledipasvir as a first line therapy option in combination with [sofosbuvir] for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, 4, 5, and 6 [L852]. Treatment with ledipasvir is used with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as ledipasvir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon- and ribavirin-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635]. \r\n\r\nSince 2014, ledipasvir has been available as a fixed dose combination product with [sofosbuvir] (tradename Harvoni) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in October 2014 by the FDA, Harvoni is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 with or without [ribavirin] depending on the level of liver damage or cirrhosis [FDA Label]. When combined together, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as the combination product Harvoni has been shown to achieve a SVR between 93 and 99% after 12 weeks of treatment [FDA Label].

Target organs for neoplastic changes were the kidneys (renal tubule and renal pelvis), urinary bladder, urethra, preputial and clitoral gland, small intestine, parathyroid glands, adrenal glands, and non-glandular stomach. Neoplastic lesions were not seen at 30 mg/kg/day for the kidneys, urinary bladder, urethra, small intestine, parathyroid glands, adrenal glands, and non-glandular stomach, and 15 mg/kg/day for the preputial and clitoral gland. The papilloma/carcinoma of the preputial/clitoral gland was noted at 30 and 60 mg/kg/day, representing approximately 0.5 to 4 or 0.3 to 2.4 times the human daily exposure (based on AUC) at 400 mg/day or 800 mg/day, respectively, and 0.4 to 3.0 times the daily exposure in children (based on AUC) at 340 mg/m2. The renal tubule adenoma/carcinoma, renal pelvis transitional cell neoplasms, the urinary bladder and urethra transitional cell papillomas, the small intestine adenocarcinomas, the parathyroid glands adenomas, the benign and malignant medullary tumors of the adrenal glands and the non-glandular stomach papillomas/carcinomas were noted at 60 mg/kg/day. The relevance of these findings in the rat carcinogenicity study for humans is not known. Positive genotoxic effects were obtained for imatinib in an in vitro mammalian cell assay (Chinese hamster ovary) for clastogenicity (chromosome aberrations) in the presence of metabolic activation. Two intermediates of the manufacturing process, which are also present in the final product, are positive for mutagenesis in the Ames assay. One of these intermediates was also positive in the mouse lymphoma assay.

Severe liver toxicity was observed in dogs treated for 2 weeks, with elevated liver enzymes, hepatocellular necrosis, bile duct necrosis, and bile duct hyperplasia. Renal toxicity was observed in monkeys treated for 2 weeks, with focal mineralization and dilation of the renal tubules and tubular nephrosis. Increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were observed in several of these animals. An increased rate of opportunistic infections was observed with chronic imatinib treatment in laboratory animal studies. In a 39-week monkey study, treatment with imatinib resulted in the worsening of normally suppressed malarial infections in these animals. Lymphopenia was observed in animals (as in humans). Additional long-term toxicities were identified in a 2-year rat study. Histopathological examination of the treated rats that died in the study revealed cardiomyopathy (both sexes), chronic progressive nephropathy (females), and preputial gland papilloma as principal causes of death or reasons for sacrifice. Non-neoplastic lesions seen in this 2-year study that were not identified in earlier preclinical studies were the cardiovascular system, pancreas, endocrine organs, and teeth.

', 'descriptions': 'Rosuvastatin, also known as the brand name product Crestor, is a lipid-lowering drug that belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage elevated lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]\r\n\r\nRosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]\r\n\r\nWhile all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]\'s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.\r\n\r\nRosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]'}, {'name': None, 'simmilarity score': array([0.987625]), 'approval status': None, 'average mass': None, 'toxicity': None, 'descriptions': None}]","[{'name': 'Lucanthone', 'simmilarity score': array([0.97799653]), 'approval status': 'not_approved', 'average mass': 340.482, 'toxicity': '', 'descriptions': 'One of the schistosomicides, it has been replaced largely by hycanthone and more recently praziquantel.

Approximately 10% of patients with NSCLC have a rapid and clinically effective response to EGFR-TKIs due to the presence of specific activating EGFR mutations within the tumour cells.[A7927] More specifically, deletions around the LREA motif in exon 19 and exon 21 L858R point mutations are correlated with response to therapy.[A7928]\r\n\r\nDevelopment of third-generation EGFR-TKIs, such as osimertinib, has been in response to altered tumour resistance patterns following treatment and toxic side effects that impact patient quality of life. Treatment with first-generation EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib and erlotinib) has been associated with the development of resistance through activating mutations in the EGFR gene. Second-generation EGFR-TKIs (afatinib and dacomitinib) were then developed to be more potent inhibitors, although their use is associated with increased toxicity through nonspecific targeting of wild-type EGFR. In contrast, third-generation inhibitors are specific for the gate-keeper T790M mutations which increases ATP binding activity to EGFR and result in poor prognosis for late-stage disease. Furthermore, osimertinib has been shown to spare wild-type EGFR during therapy, thereby reducing non-specific binding and limiting toxicity.[A7926,A7927,A7931]'}, {'name': 'Palbociclib', 'simmilarity score': array([0.75664079]), 'approval status': 'approved', 'average mass': 447.5328, 'toxicity': 'The reported oral Ld50 is of 100 mg/kg.[MSDS] In cases of overdosage, only supportive measures are considered.[FDA label]\r\n\r\nPalbociclib was showed to present clastogenic activities in _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ assays.

Although structurally distinct from THC, nabilone mimics THC's structure and pharmacological activity through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, however it is considered to be twice as active as Δ⁹-THC. Nabilone is approved by the FDA for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nTetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body [A32830]. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms like Nabilone or [DB00470]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.\r\n\r\nFrom a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (via the Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 and CB2) and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others [A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. CB2 receptors are mainly located in the peripheral nervous system and can be found on lymphoid tissue where they are involved in regulation of immune function [A32676].\r\n\r\nIn Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Mexico, nabilone is marketed as Cesamet. It was approved in 1985 by the United States FDA for treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting that has not responded to conventional antiemetics.

Intraperitoneal and subcutaneous LD<sub>50</sub> in mice are 191 mg/kg and 320 mg/kg, respectively.[MSDS] In placebo-controlled trials, there were increased incidences of mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis receiving antipsychotic medications. The risk of death in drug-treated patients was about 1.6 to 1.7 times that of placebo-treated patients. Deaths were largely resulting from cardiovascular, such as heart failure and sudden death, or infectious, such as pneumonia, conditions.[label] Due to its antagonist action on dopamine receptors, prochlorperazine is associated with a risk for developing extrapyramidal symptoms such as tardive dyskinesia, which is a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. This risk is also conferred on other antipsychotic agents that block dopamine receptors. It is proposed that increased duration of the drug treatment is likely thus increased total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient leads to increased risk for developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversible. As with other antipsychotic agents, prochlorperazine is associated with a risk for causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which is a potentially fatal symptom complex, which is manifested as hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability. \r\n\r\nThere is no known antidote for prochlorperazine thus overdose treatment should be supportive and symptomatic. Overdose of prochlorperazine may produce dystonic reactions that involve extrapyramidal mechanism. To reduce these symptoms, antiparkinsonism drugs, barbiturates, or diphenhydramine may be used. Symptoms of central nervous system depression, such as somnolence or coma, may also be observed. Amphetamine, destroamphetamine, or caffeine and sodium benzoate may be used to induce stimulatory effects. In contrast, agitation and restlessness may also be seen in case of overdose. Other possible manifestations include convulsions, EKG changes and cardiac arrhythmias, fever, and autonomic reactions such as hypotension, dry mouth and ileus. Hypotension can be responded with the standard measures for managing circulatory shock.[label] \r\n\r\n**Nonclinical Toxicology**\r\n\r\nIn a rat developmental or reproductive toxicity study, abnormalities in both the reproductive measures and neurobehavioral testing were observed following administration of 25 mg/kg of prochlorperazine.[L6649] \r\n\r\n**Use in specific populations**\r\n\r\nAs the use of antipsychotic agents during the third trimester of pregnancy is associated with a risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery, the use of prochlorperazine in pregnant patients is generally not recommended and it should be limited after careful consideration of the potential benefit of drug therapy justifying the potential risk to the fetus. Caution should be exercised when prochlorperazine is administered to a nursing mother. While lower doses of prochlorperazine is reported to be safe for elderly patients, caution is still advised, especially those with higher susceptibility to hypotension and neuromuscular reactions.[label]', 'descriptions': 'Prochlorperazine, also known as compazine, is a piperazine phenothiazine and first-generation antipsychotic drug that is used for the treatment of severe nausea and vomiting, as well as short-term management of psychotic disorders such as generalized non-psychotic anxiety and schizophrenia.[label] It mainly works by depressing the chemoreceptor trigger zone and blocking D2 dopamine receptors in the brain. It was shown to also block histaminergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic receptors.[L6637] Prochlorperazine was first developed in the 1950s [L6643] and was first approved by the FDA in 1956. Although newer antiemetic agents such as 5-HT3 antagonists are more heavily promoted, prochlorperazine is still widely used in nausea and vomiting.[L6640]'}, {'name': 'Aripiprazole', 'simmilarity score': array([0.98301131]), 'approval status': 'approved', 'average mass': 448.385, 'toxicity': ""Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY, during the third trimester of  pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. Overall available data from published epidemiologic studies of pregnant women exposed to aripiprazole have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, or major depressive disorder, and with exposure to antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, during pregnancy.[L45859] \r\n\r\nIn animal reproduction studies, oral and intravenous aripiprazole administration during organogenesis in rats and/or rabbits at doses 10 and 19 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 30 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area, produced fetal death, decreased fetal weight, undescended testicles, delayed skeletal ossification, skeletal abnormalities, and diaphragmatic hernia. Oral and intravenous aripiprazole administration during the pre- and post-natal period in rats at doses 10 times the MRHD based on mg/m2 body surface area, produced prolonged gestation, stillbirths, decreased pup weight, and decreased pup survival.[L45859]  \r\n\r\nABILIFY has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of ABILIFY misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drug-seeking behavior).[L45859]\r\n\r\nIn physical dependence studies in monkeys, withdrawal symptoms were observed upon abrupt cessation of dosing. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drug-seeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed.[L45859] \r\n\r\nIn clinical trials and in postmarketing experience, adverse reactions of deliberate or accidental overdosage with oral ABILIFY have been reported worldwide. These include overdoses with oral ABILIFY alone and in combination with other substances. No fatality was reported with ABILIFY alone. The largest known dose with a known outcome involved acute ingestion of 1,260 mg of oral ABILIFY (42 times the maximum recommended daily dose) by a patient who fully recovered. Deliberate or accidental overdosage was also reported in children (age 12 years and younger) involving oral ABILIFY ingestions up to 195 mg with no fatalities.[L45859]  \r\n\r\nCommon adverse reactions (reported in at least 5% of all overdose cases) reported with oral ABILIFY overdosage (alone or in combination with other substances) include vomiting, somnolence, and tremor. Other clinically important signs and symptoms observed in one or more patients with ABILIFY overdoses (alone or with other substances) include acidosis, aggression, aspartate aminotransferase increased, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, coma, confusional state, convulsion, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, depressed level of consciousness, hypertension, hypokalemia, hypotension, lethargy, loss of consciousness, QRS complex prolonged, QT prolonged, pneumonia aspiration, respiratory arrest, status epilepticus, and tachycardia.[L45859] \r\n\r\nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with ABILIFY. An electrocardiogram should be obtained in case of overdosage and if QT interval prolongation is present, cardiac monitoring should be instituted. Otherwise, management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.[L45859]  \r\n_Charcoal_: In the event of an overdose of ABILIFY, an early charcoal administration may be useful in partially preventing the absorption of aripiprazole. Administration of 50 g of activated charcoal, one hour after a single 15 mg oral dose of ABILIFY, decreased the mean AUC and C<sub>max</sub> of aripiprazole by 50%.[L45859] \r\n_Hemodialysis_: Although there is no information on the effect of hemodialysis in treating an overdose with ABILIFY, hemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.[L45859]  \r\n\r\nLifetime carcinogenicity studies were conducted in ICR mice, F344 rats, and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Aripiprazole was administered for 2 years in the diet at doses of 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day to ICR mice and 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day to F344 rats (0.2, 0.5, 2 and 5 times and 0.3, 1 and 3 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area, respectively). In addition, SD rats were dosed orally for 2 years at 10, 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg/day, which are 3, 6, 13 and 19 times the MRHD based on mg/m2 body surface area. Aripiprazole did not induce tumors in male mice or male rats. In female mice, the incidences of pituitary gland adenomas and mammary gland adenocarcinomas and adenoacanthomas were increased at dietary doses of 3 to 30 mg/kg/day (0.5 to 5 times the MRHD). In female rats, the incidence of mammary gland fibroadenomas was increased at a dietary dose of 10 mg/kg/day (3 times the MRHD); and the incidences of adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/carcinomas were increased at an oral dose of 60 mg/kg/day (19 times the MRHD).[L45859] \r\n\r\nAn increase in mammary, pituitary, and endocrine pancreas neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is considered to be mediated by prolonged dopamine D2-receptor antagonism and hyperprolactinemia. Serum prolactin was not measured in the aripiprazole carcinogenicity studies. However, increases in serum prolactin levels were observed in female mice in a 13 week dietary study at the doses associated with mammary gland and pituitary tumors. Serum prolactin was not increased in female rats in 4 week and 13 week dietary studies at the dose associated with mammary gland tumors. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unclear.[L45859]\r\n\r\nThe mutagenic potential of aripiprazole was tested in the in vitro bacterial reverse-mutation assay, the in vitro bacterial DNA repair assay, the in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells, the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells, the in vivo micronucleus assay in mice, and the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in rats. Aripiprazole and a metabolite (2,3-DCPP) were clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in CHL cells with and without metabolic activation. The metabolite, 2,3-DCPP, increased numerical aberrations in the in vitro assay in CHL cells in the absence of metabolic activation. A positive response was obtained in the in vivo micronucleus assay in mice; however, the response was due to a mechanism not considered relevant to humans.[L45859] \r\n\r\nFemale rats were treated orally with aripiprazole from 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation Day 7 at doses of 2, 6, and 20 mg/kg/day, which are 0.6, 2, and 6 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area. Estrus cycle irregularities and increased corpora lutea were seen at all doses, but no impairment of fertility was seen. Increased pre-implantation loss was seen at 2 and 6 times the MRHD, and decreased fetal weight was seen at 6 times the MRHD.[L45859] \r\n\r\nMale rats were treated orally with aripiprazole from 9 weeks prior to mating through mating at doses of 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg/day, which are 6, 13, and 19 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area. Disturbances in spermatogenesis were seen at 19 times the MRHD and prostate atrophy was seen at 13 and 19 times the MRHD without impairment of fertility.[L45859] \r\n\r\n\r\nPharmacokinetic properties in patients 10-17 years of age are similar to that of adults once body weight has been corrected for. No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients however aripiprazole is not approved for Alzheimer's associated psychosis. Patients classified as CYP2D6 poor metabolizers should be prescribed half the regular dose of aripiprazole.

It is a major phytocannabinoid, accounting for up to 40% of the Cannabis plant\'s extract, that binds to a wide variety of physiological targets of the endocannabinoid system within the body. Although the exact medical implications are currently being investigated, CBD has shown promise as a therapeutic and pharmaceutical drug target. In particular, CBD has shown promise as an analgesic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, anxiolytic, antipsychotic and has shown neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity, among other currently investigated uses [A32477, A32469]. CBD\'s exact place within medical practice is still currently hotly debated, however as the body of evidence grows and legislation changes to reflect its wide-spread use, public and medical opinion have changed significantly with regards to its usefulness in a number of medical conditions ranging from anxiety to epilepsy.\r\n\r\nFrom a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis\' (and CBD\'s) diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. Cannabinoid receptors are utilized endogenously by the body through the endocannabinoid system, which includes a group of lipid proteins, enzymes, and receptors that are involved in many physiological processes. Through its modulation of neurotransmitter release, the endocannabinoid system regulates cognition, pain sensation, appetite, memory, sleep, immune function, and mood among many other bodily systems. These effects are largely mediated through two members of the G-protein coupled receptor family, cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2)[A32585,A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, with the majority of receptors localized to the hippocampus and amygdala of the brain. Physiological effects of using cannabis make sense in the context of its receptor activity as the hippocampus and amygdala are primarily involved with regulation of memory, fear, and emotion. In contrast, CB2 receptors are mainly found peripherally in immune cells, lymphoid tissue, and peripheral nerve terminals [A32676].\r\n\r\nTetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are two types of cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which interact with the cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body. Although THC and CBD have been the most studied cannabinoids, there are many others identified to date including cannabinol (CBN), cannabigerol (CBG), [DB14050] (CBDV), and [DB11755] (THCV) that can be found within the medical cannabis [A32830]. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms of THC like [DB00470] or [DB00486]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.\r\n\r\nThe primary psychoactive component of Cannabis, delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors. This activity results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes. In contrast to THC\'s weak agonist activity, CBD has been shown to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, the most abundant G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) in the body [A32469]. Allosteric regulation is achieved through the modulation of receptor activity on a functionally distinct site from the agonist or antagonist binding site which is clinically significant as direct agonists (such as THC) are limited by their psychomimetic effects such as changes to mood, memory, and anxiety[A32469]. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the well-known activity on CB1 and CB2 receptors, there is further evidence that CBD also activates 5-HT1A/2A/3A serotonergic and TRPV1–2 vanilloid receptors, antagonizes alpha-1 adrenergic and µ-opioid receptors, inhibits synaptosomal uptake of noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and cellular uptake of anandamide, acts on mitochondria Ca2+ stores, blocks low-voltage-activated (T-type) Ca2+ channels, stimulates activity of the inhibitory glycine-receptor, and inhibits activity of fatty amide hydrolase (FAAH) [A31555, A31574].\r\n\r\nCBD is currently available in Canada within a 1:1 formulation with tetrahydrocannbinol (THC) (as the formulation known as ""nabiximols"") as the brand name product Sativex. It is approved for use as adjunctive treatment for symptomatic relief of spasticity in adult patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Sativex was also given a conditional Notice of Compliance (NOC/c) for use as adjunctive treatment for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain in adult patients with multiple sclerosis and as adjunctive analgesic treatment for moderate to severe pain in adult patients with advanced cancer [L886].\r\n\r\nIn April 2018, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel unanimously recommended approval of Epidiolex (cannabidiol oral solution) for the treatment of two rare forms of epilepsy - Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, which are among the two most difficult types of epilepsy to treat [L2721, L2719]. Epidiolex was granted Orphan Drug designation as well as Fast Track Approval from the FDA for further study in these hard to treat conditions. Notably, phase 3 clinical trials of Epidiolex have demonstrated clinically significant improvement in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome [L2720]. On June 25th, 2018, Epidiolex was approved by the FDA to be the first CBD-based product available on the US market.'}, {'name': 'Ezetimibe', 'simmilarity score': array([0.99007463]), 'approval status': 'approved', 'average mass': 409.4252, 'toxicity': 'Oral LD<sub>50</sub> and intraperitoneal LD<sub>50</sub> in rat were >2000 mg/kg.[L11410] Estimated oral LD50 values in mouse and dog are >5000 mg/kg and >3000 mg/kg, respectively.[L11410] One case of accidental overdose occurred in clinical studies in one female patient with homozygous sitosterolemia receiving 120 mg/day for 28 days with no reported clinical or laboratory adverse events.[L11347] In case of overdose, symptomatic treatment is recommended.[L11347]', 'descriptions': 'Ezetimibe is a lipid-lowering compound that inhibits intestinal cholesterol and phytosterol absorption.

This includes the hypothalamus, which is involved in appetite regulation, and the mesolimbic dopamine circuit, which is involved in reward pathways.[L6562] Studies have shown that the combined activity of bupropion and [naltrexone] increase the firing rate of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and blockade of opioid receptor-mediated POMC auto-inhibition, which are associated with a reduction in food intake and increased energy expenditure.[L6562,A179038,A179050] The combination of naltrexone and bupropion was shown to result in a statistically significant weight loss, with a mean change in body weight of -6.3% compared to -1.3% for placebo.[A179047]'}, {'name': None, 'simmilarity score': array([0.99681318]), 'approval status': None, 'average mass': None, 'toxicity': None, 'descriptions': None}, {'name': 'Nizatidine', 'simmilarity score': array([0.99672341]), 'approval status': 'approved', 'average mass': 331.45, 'toxicity': 'Oral, rat LD<sub>50</sub>: 301 mg/kg.

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Dasabuvir. Dasabuvir is a non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitor which binds to the palm domain of NS5B and induces a conformational change which renders the polymerase unable to elongate viral RNA [FDA Label]. The binding sites for non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitors are poorly conserved across HCV genotypes leading to the restriction of Dasabuvir's use to genotype 1 only.\r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Dasabuvir as first line therapy in combination with [DB09296], [DB09297], and [DB00503] for genotype 1b and with [DB00811] for genotype 1a of Hepatitis C [L852].

', 'descriptions': ""Simeprevir is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease inhibitor indicated in patient's with HCV genotype 1 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Like all NS3/4A inhibitors, simeprevir is a serine protease inhibitor in similarity to [DB08873] and [DB05521] but is classified as a second generation protease inhibitor. This class of antiviral drugs were the first direct acting antivirals approved but are associated with lower cure rates than newer drugs. Broad use of simeprevir occurred when it was used in combination with a newer drug, [DB08934]. Inhibiting HCV NS3/4A protease in a potent and highly specific manner, simeprevir is a direct-acting antiviral agent against the hepatitis C virus. Since the viral protease NS3/4A complex is essential for cleaving the HCV encoded polyprotein into individual viral proteins facilitating replication [A19632], the drug blocks the viral replication process. It is shown to display synergistic effects with interferon-α and HCV NS5B inhibitor, and additive effects with ribavirin in HCV replicon cells [A19629]. Unlike first generation serine protease inhibitors, simprevir has a sightly different resistance profile where limited therapeutic efficacy of the drug is observed with NS3 Q80K polymorphic variants and simeprevir-specific amino acid position of 168 also results in higher treatment failure rates [A19630]. The observed prevalence of the N3 Q80K polymorphism was 30% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1a and 0.5% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1b [A19630]. \r\n\r\nAccording to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), simeprevir can be used as first-line or second-line threapies for treatment-naïve patients as adjunct to sofosbuvir treatment for genotype 1 or PEG-Interferon/ribavirin combination therapy for genotype 1 or 4. The combination therapy of simeprevir and other antiviral agents are initiated in HCV-positive patients with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].\r\n\r\nSimeprevir was approved by the FDA in November 2014 and is marketed under the brand name Olysio as oral tablets. Administered once daily with food, 150mg simeprevir capsule is used in combination with [DB08934] in patients with HCV genotype 1 without cirrhosis for 12 week duration. In patients with HCV genotype 1 with compensated cirrhosis, the treatment is directed for 24 week duration. Sustained virologic response 12 weeks after planned end of treatment (SVR12) was achieved in 170/176 (97%) subjects without cirrhosis treated with 12 weeks simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir (FDA Label). The overall SVR12 was 88% (44/50) in treatment-naïve patients with cirrhosis [L852].\r\n\r\nSimeprevir is also used in treatment of HCV genotype 4 patients with or without cirrhosis and is taken with [DB00008] and [DB00811]; this triple therapy allows shortening treatment duration from 48 weeks or longer to 12 or 24 weeks [A19630] depending on prior response status and presence of HIV-1 co-infection. Prior to initiation of treatment with [DB00008] and [DB00811], screening for the presence of virus with the NS3 Q80K polymorphism is strongly recommended and if detected, alternative treatment should be considered instead to prevent therapeutic failure.

Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Boceprevir. Boceprevir is an inhibitor of NS3/4A, a serine protease enzyme, encoded by HCV genotypes 1 and 4 [synthesis]. These enzymes are essential for viral replication and serve to cleave the virally encoded polyprotein into mature proteins like NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B [FDA Label]. The barrier for develoment of resistance to NS3/4A inhibitors is lower than that of NS5B inhibitors, another class of DAAs [A19593]. Subtitutions at amino acid positions 155, 156, or 168 are known to confer resistance. The substitutions of the enzyme's catalytic triad consisting of H58, D82, and S139 are also likely to alter the affinity of the drug for NS3/4A or the activity of the enzyme itself. Despite this disadvantage Boceprevir is still effective against HCV when paired with [DB00811], [DB00008], and [DB00022].\r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) do not reccomend Boceprevir in combination with [DB00811], [DB00008], and [DB00022] as first line therapy for Hepatitis C [A19593].

At this time, there is insufficient data to determine whether the use of progestin-only contraceptives increases the risk in a similar way to combined contraceptives. A meta-analysis of 54 studies showed a small increase in the frequency of breast cancer diagnosis for women who were currently using combined oral contraceptives, or had used them within the past 10 years.

Since PPD, like various other types of depression, is characterized by feelings of sadness, worthlessness or guilt, cognitive impairment, and/or possibly suicidal ideation, it is considered a life-threatening condition [F4072].

The development and availability of brexanolone for the treatment of PPD in adult females subsequently provides a new and promising therapy where few existed before [F4066].\r\n\r\nIn particular, the use of brexanolone in treating PPD is surrounded with promise because it acts in part as a synthetic supplement for possible deficiencies in endogenous brexanolone (allopregnanolone) in postpartum women susceptible to PPD whereas many commonly used anti-depressive medications elicit actions that may modulate the presence and activity of substances like serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or monoamine oxidase but do not mediate activities directly associated with PPD like natural fluctuations in the levels of endogenous neuroactive steroids like allopregnanolone [F4063].\r\n\r\nAnd finally, although brexanolone may also be undergoing clinical trials to investigate its abilities to treat super-refractory status epilepticus, it appears that some such studies have failed to meet primary endpoints that compare success in the weaning of third-line agents and resolution of potentially life-threatening status epilepticus with brexanolone vs. placebo when added to standard-of-care [L5750].'}]","[{'name': 'Ganaxolone', 'simmilarity score': array([0.98212981]), 'approval status': 'approved', 'average mass': 332.528, 'toxicity': 'Experience with ganaxolone overdose is limited to a single report of an unintentional overdose in a pediatric patient, in which the patient received ten-fold the prescribed dose.

Bupropion exerts its pharmacological effects by weakly inhibiting the enzymes involved in the uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine from the synaptic cleft, therefore prolonging their duration of action within the neuronal synapse and the downstream effects of these neurotransmitters. More specifically, bupropion binds to the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the dopamine transporter (DAT).[A6399,A178810]\r\n\r\nBupropion was originally classified as an ""atypical"" antidepressant because it does not exert the same effects as the classical antidepressants such as Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs), or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). While it has comparable effectiveness to typical first-line options for the treatment of depression such as SSRIs,[A178798,A178804] bupropion is a unique option for the treatment of MDD as it lacks any clinically relevant serotonergic effects, typical of other mood medications, or any effects on histamine or adrenaline receptors.[A6399,A178840] Lack of activity at these receptors results in a more tolerable side effect profile; bupropion is less likely to cause sexual side effects, sedation, or weight gain as compared to SSRIs or TCAs, for example.[A178804,A178807]\r\n\r\nWhen used as an aid to smoking cessation, bupropion is thought to confer its anti-craving and anti-withdrawal effects by inhibiting dopamine reuptake, which is thought to be involved in the reward pathways associated with nicotine, and through the antagonism of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor.[A178825,A1966,A16508] A Cochrane Review of meta-analyses of available treatment modalities for smoking cessation found that abstinence rates approximately doubled when bupropion was used as compared to placebo, and was found to have similar rates of smoking cessation as [nicotine] replacement therapy (NRT).[A178816]\r\n\r\nBupropion is sometimes used as an add-on agent to first-line treatments of depression such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications when there is a treatment-failure or only partial response.[A178789] Bupropion is also used off-label for the management of Attention/Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults with comorbid bipolar depression to avoid mood destabilization caused by typical stimulant medications used for the treatment of ADHD.[F4624]\r\n\r\nWhen used in combination with [naltrexone] in the marketed product ContraveⓇ for chronic weight management, the two components are thought to have effects on areas of the brain involved in the regulation of food intake.
