Cyclobenzaprine,"Cyclobenzaprine, a centrally-acting muscle relaxant, was first synthesized in 1961[A185039] and has been available for human use since 1977.[A184982] It was initially studied for use as antidepressant given its structural similarity to tricyclic antidepressants - it differs from [Amitriptyline] by only a single double bond.[A185039,A184982] Since its approval, it has remained relatively popular as an adjunctive, short-term treatment for acute skeletal muscle spasms secondary to musculoskeletal injury.",275.3874,"The oral LD<sub>50</sub> of cyclobenzaprine in mice and rats is 338 mg/kg and 425 mg/kg, respectively. Signs of overdose may develop rapidly after ingestion and commonly include significant drowsiness and tachycardia, with less common manifestations including tremor, agitation, ataxia, GI upset, and other CNS effects such as confusion and hallucinations. Potentially critical manifestations, though rare, include cardiac arrest or dysrhythmias, severe hypotension, seizures, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.[L8408,L8411]

As the management of cyclobenzaprine overdose is complex and ever-changing, it is recommended that a poison control center be consulted prior to treatment. Typical management involves gastrointestinal decontamination, close cardiac monitoring, and monitoring for signs of CNS or respiratory depression. As cyclobenzaprine exists in relatively low concentrations in plasma, monitoring of drug plasma levels should not guide management and dialysis is likely of no value.[L8408,L8411]",['approved'],1,approved,CN(C)CCC=C1C2=CC=CC=C2C=CC2=CC=CC=C12,"[{'Water Solubility': 'Freely Soluble'}, {'Melting Point': '217'}, {'logP': '5.2'}, {'pKa': '8.47'}]","[{'logP': '4.73'}, {'logS': '-4.6'}, {'Water Solubility': '6.89e-03 g/l'}, {'logP': '4.61'}, {'IUPAC Name': 'dimethyl(3-{tricyclo[9.4.0.0^{3,8}]pentadeca-1(15),3,5,7,9,11,13-heptaen-2-ylidene}propyl)amine'}, {'Traditional IUPAC Name': 'tetrahydrofolic acid'}, {'Molecular Weight': '275.3874'}, {'Monoisotopic Weight': '275.167399677'}, {'SMILES': 'CN(C)CCC=C1C2=CC=CC=C2C=CC2=CC=CC=C12'}, {'Molecular Formula': 'C20H21N'}, {'InChI': 'InChI=1S/C20H21N/c1-21(2)15-7-12-20-18-10-5-3-8-16(18)13-14-17-9-4-6-11-19(17)20/h3-6,8-14H,7,15H2,1-2H3'}, {'InChIKey': 'JURKNVYFZMSNLP-UHFFFAOYSA-N'}, {'Polar Surface Area (PSA)': '3.24'}, {'Refractivity': '102.62'}, {'Polarizability': '32.94'}, {'Rotatable Bond Count': '3'}, {'H Bond Acceptor Count': '1'}, {'H Bond Donor Count': '0'}, {'pKa (strongest basic)': '9.76'}, {'Physiological Charge': '1'}, {'Number of Rings': '3'}, {'Bioavailability': '1'}, {'Rule of Five': '1'}, {'Ghose Filter': '1'}, {'MDDR-Like Rule': '0'}]","{'most_app':                         name  \

The risk related to overdose appears more pronounced in pediatric patients. One case report detailed a fatal cardiogenic shock in a 2.1kg infant following an approximately 10-fold overdose of Kaletra oral solution, while other reported reactions to overdose in infants include complete AV block, cardiomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and acute renal failure. The oral Kaletra solution is highly concentrated, posing a greater risk of overdose, and contains approximately 42% (v/v) ethanol, further increasing risk in children and infants.[L11163]\r\n\r\nThere is no antidote for lopinavir overdose. Treatment of overdose should consist largely of supportive measures and close observation of vital signs and clinical status of the affected patient. Consideration should be given to the removal of unabsorbed drug using gastric lavage or activated charcoal, if clinically indicated. Dialysis is unlikely to be of benefit as lopinavir is highly protein-bound, but may help to remove ethanol and propylene glycol from the circulation in the case of overdose with Kaletra oral solution.[L11163]', 'descriptions': 'Lopinavir is an antiretroviral protease inhibitor used in combination with other antiretrovirals in the treatment of HIV-1 infection.[L11163] Lopinavir is marketed and administered exclusively in combination with [ritonavir] - this combination, first marketed by Abbott under the brand name Kaletra in 2000, is necessary due to lopinavir\'s poor oral bioavailability and extensive biotransformation. Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of the enzymes responsible for lopinavir metabolism, and its co-administration ""boosts"" lopinavir exposure and improves antiviral activity.[L11163] Like many other protease inhibitors (e.g. [saquinavir], [nelfinavir]), lopinavir is a peptidomimetic molecule - it contains a hydroxyethylene scaffold that mimics the peptide linkage typically targeted by the HIV-1 protease enzyme but which itself cannot be cleaved, thus preventing the activity of the HIV-1 protease.[A191757]\r\n\r\nLopinavir was previously under investigation in combination with ritonavir for the treatment of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.[L12012]'}, {'name': 'Daclatasvir', 'simmilarity score': array([0.97276074]), 'approval status': 'approved', 'average mass': 738.89, 'toxicity': 'The most common adverse effects experienced in patients undergoing daclatasvir and sofosbuvir therapy include headache, fatigue, nausea and diarrhea. Similar side effects are seen when ribavirin is added, in addition to rash, insomnia, anemia, dizziness and somnolence. There are postmarketing cases that link serious symptomatic bradycardia with Daklinza when used in conjunction with sofosbuvir and amiodarone. Coadministration of these three drugs is not recommended unless there are no other alternatives.', 'descriptions': 'Daclatasvir is a direct-acting antiviral agent against Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) used for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 and 3 infection. It is marketed under the name DAKLINZA and is contained in daily oral tablets as the hydrochloride salt form . Hepatitis C is an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Daclatasvir was the first drug with demonstrated safety and therapeutic efficacy in treating HCV genotype 3 without the need for co-administration of interferon or [DB00811]. It exerts its antiviral action by preventing RNA replication and virion assembly via binding to NS5A, a nonstructural phosphoprotein encoded by HCV. Binding to the N-terminus of the D1 domain of NS5A prevents its interaction with host cell proteins and membranes required for virion replication complex assembly. Daclatasvir is shown to target both the cis- and trans-acting functions of NS5A and disrupts the function of new HCV replication complexes by modulating the NS5A phosphorylation status [A19640]. The most common critical NS5A amino acid substitutions that led to reduced susceptibility to daclatasvir therapy occured at position Q30 (Q30H/K/R) and M28 in genotype 1a patients and Y93H in genotype 3 patients. \r\n\r\nAccording to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), 60mg of daclatasvir is recommended with 400mg [DB08934] for genotype 1a/b patients with or without cirrhosis as second-line therapy. The same dosing regimen can be used as first-line therapy in patients with genotype 3 without cirrhosis and second-line therapy in genotype 3 patients with compensated cirrhosis. Combination therapies that include daclatasir can be used for challenging-to-treat patients who have HIV-1 coinfection, advanced cirrhosis, or post-liver transplant recurrence of HCV [L863]. The therapy is intended to cure or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR12), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. \r\n\r\nDaclatasvir was FDA-approved in July 2015 for use with [DB08934] (Sovaldi) with or without [DB00811] to treat HCV genotype 1 and 3 infections. The SVR12 in HCV genotype 1a-infected treatment-naïve subjects without and with cirrhosis undergoing daclatasvir and [DB08934] therapy were 88% and 99%, respectively [FDA Label]. The same dosing regimen in treatment-naïve patients with HCV genotype 3 infection with or without cirrhosis achieved SVR12 rates of 71% and 98%, respectively [FDA Label].'}, {'name': 'Glutethimide', 'simmilarity score': array([0.97188401]), 'approval status': 'approved', 'average mass': 217.2637, 'toxicity': 'In adults, death has been reported after 5 g.

It has been classified differently according to its drug properties in which based on its chemical structure, gliclazide is considered a first-generation sulfonylurea due to the structural presence of a sulfonamide group able to release a proton and the presence of one aromatic group.[A39546] On the other hand, based on the pharmacological efficacy, gliclazide is considered a second-generation sulfonylurea which presents a higher potency and a shorter half-life.[T238, T360] Gliclazide belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating &beta; cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic &beta; cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Gliclazide has been shown to decrease fasting plasma glucose, postprandial blood glucose and glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels (reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control). Gliclazide is extensively metabolized by the liver; its metabolites are excreted in both urine (60-70%) and feces (10-20%).'}, {'name': 'Indigotindisulfonic acid', 'simmilarity score': array([0.83342969]), 'approval status': 'approved', 'average mass': 422.389, 'toxicity': 'Toxicity information regarding indigotindisulfonic acid is not readily available.
