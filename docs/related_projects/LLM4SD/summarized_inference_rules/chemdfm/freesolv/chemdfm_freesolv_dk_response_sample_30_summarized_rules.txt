**Rule 1:** Molecules containing aromatic rings generally exhibit negative hydration free energies, enhancing their solubility in water due to potential interactions like hydrogen bonding with water molecules.

**Rule 2:** Molecules featuring chlorine atoms typically have positive hydration free energies, reflecting decreased solubility in water, possibly due to increased hydrophobicity and fewer favorable interactions with water.

**Rule 3:** The presence of polar functional groups such as amine, hydroxyl, carboxylic acids, and halogens, especially in combination with aromatic structures, can significantly influence hydration free energy, generally contributing to negative values indicating higher solubility due to favorable interactions with water molecules like hydrogen bonding.

**Rule 4:** Hydrophobic groups (long carbon chains, nonpolar structures) contribute to positive hydration free energies, making the molecules less soluble in water due to limited favorable interactions with water molecules.

**Rule 5:** The presence of multiple bonds (double or triple bonds) within molecules typically correlates with less favorable hydration free energies, suggesting less solubility in water compared to their saturated counterparts, possibly due to hydrophobic interactions.

**Rule 6:** Molecules with alkyl groups usually demonstrate positive hydration free energies, indicating hydrophobic characteristics and reduced favorability in aqueous solutions.
