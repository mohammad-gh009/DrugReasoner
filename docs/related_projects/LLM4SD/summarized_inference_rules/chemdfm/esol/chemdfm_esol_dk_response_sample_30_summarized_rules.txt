Rule 1: Molecules containing hydroxyl groups or carboxylic acid groups have higher solubility, suggesting lower ESOL values.
Example: OCC(O)CO has higher solubility indicated by a lower ESOL value of 0.688.

Rule 2: Molecules featuring aromatic rings generally exhibit higher solubility, reflecting in lower ESOL values.
Example: The molecule c1ccccc1 with an ESOL value of -3.099 indicates increased solubility due to the presence of aromatic rings.

Rule 3: Molecules with halogenated aromatic rings show decreased solubility, represented by higher ESOL values.
Example: Clc1cccc2cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc12 with an ESOL value of -7.343 shows reduced solubility due to halogen substituents on aromatic rings.

Rule 4: Molecules that have long hydrocarbon chains or large alkyl groups are generally less soluble in water, indicating higher ESOL values.
Example: A molecule like CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO, with an ESOL value of -4.231, shows lowered solubility due to its long hydrocarbon chain.

Rule 5: The presence of electron-withdrawing groups in molecules tends to lower their solubility (higher ESOL values), while electron-donating groups increase solubility (lower ESOL values).
Example: Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O showcases a higher ESOL value of -2.640 due to electron-withdrawing nitro groups.

Rule 6: The presence of polar functional groups, such as amides, carbonyls, and sulfones, generally increases a molecule's solubility in water, reflected in lower ESOL values.
Example: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1 (C(C)C)CC=C demonstrates better solubility with an ESOL value of -1.706 due to amide and carbonyl groups. 

Rule 7: Molecules with substantial molecular complexity, such as multiple rings or chlorine atoms, tend to have lower solubility, hence higher ESOL values.
Example: The complex molecule Cc1c2ccccc2cc3ccccc13 with an ESOL value of -4.870 highlights the impact of molecular complexity on solubility.

These rules provide a comprehensive guideline to predict a molecule's water solubility based on its structure and functional groups, though exceptions can occur and it's crucial to consider the entire molecular context for accurate predictions.
