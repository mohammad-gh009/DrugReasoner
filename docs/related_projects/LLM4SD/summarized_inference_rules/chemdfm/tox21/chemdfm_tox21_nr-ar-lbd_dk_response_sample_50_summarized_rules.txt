**Rule 1:** Molecules containing halogens (chlorine, bromine, iodine) or aromatic rings are more likely to have adverse effects due to their potential to interfere with cellular processes or cause oxidative stress.

**Rule 2:** Molecules with electrophilic moieties such as ketones, aldehydes, and acids, or those with electron-withdrawing groups substituted on aromatic rings, are more prone to adverse effects because these groups can react with nucleophilic residues in the body, leading to cytotoxicity.

**Rule 3:** Molecules capable of binding to the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway, or those with structures similar to known androgen receptor agonists or antagonists, are likely to have adverse effects due to their potential to disrupt hormonal regulation.

**Rule 4:** Molecules with large lipophilicity or multiple bonds (indicative of unsaturated or aromatic compounds), which enhance their ability to cross cell membranes and interact with intracellular targets, tend to exhibit higher toxicity.

**Rule 5:** Molecules with polar or ionizable functional groups (e.g., amines, carboxylic acids, sulfonamides) are more likely to have adverse effects due to their interactions with biological molecules, potentially leading to altered functions and toxic outcomes.

**Rule 6:** Molecules containing organosulfur groups or organic phosphates generally exhibit lower toxicity activity against the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain, possibly due to their different interactions with the receptor or metabolic pathways.

**Rule 7:** The presence of certain atoms or ions, especially heavy metals (like lead, arsenic) or reactive oxygen species, can signal a higher likelihood of adverse effects, as these elements are typically associated with high reactivity and potential for biological interference. 

**Rule 8:** Functional complexity, such as molecules with multiple rings, conjugated systems, or unusual structural features like macrocycles, increases the likelihood of adverse effects due to the potential for unexpected interactions with biological systems.

**Rule 9:** Molecules that show positive formal charges or are capable of metabolic activation to form reactive intermediates (like epoxides) are more likely to cause adverse effects through mechanisms like DNA damage or interference with normal cellular functions.

**Rule 10:** Compounds that contain structures known to accumulate in biological systems, such as those with high boiling points or persistent environmental pollutants (e.g., PCBs, dioxins), are often linked to long-term adverse effects, including carcinogenicity and endocrine disruption.
