Rule 1: Molecules with halogens like chlorine or bromine are likely to be toxic.
Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic amino groups may exhibit toxic properties.
Rule 3: Molecules containing aromatic ring systems associated with electron-deficient double bonds potentially have higher toxicity.
Rule 4: Molecules with an aromatic ring structure are more prone to causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: Molecules with unsaturated bonds might increase the likelihood of toxicity.
Rule 6: Compounds with certain functional groups such as -N=[N+]([O-]) indicate potential toxic activity.
Rule 7: Organic compounds that have halogenated aromatic rings tend to show higher toxic activity.
Rule 8: Molecules that interact with nuclear receptors or biological targets such as peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (NR signaling pathway) often exhibit toxicity.
Rule 9: Molecules with a high number of halogen atoms in the benzene ring (more than 7) show increased toxic activity.
Rule 10: The presence of negatively charged groups like Michael acceptor groups increases the toxicity potential of a molecule.
