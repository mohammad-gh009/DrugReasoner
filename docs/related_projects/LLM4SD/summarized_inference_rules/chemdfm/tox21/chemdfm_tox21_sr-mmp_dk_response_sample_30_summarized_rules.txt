Rule 1: Molecules with halogenated aromatic rings are more likely to be toxic. This includes molecules with chlorine, bromine, or other halogens attached to aromatic rings.

Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic rings that incorporate electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups or additional halogens, have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 3: Molecules containing certain functional groups such as aldehydes, aromatic amines, and sulfides are more likely to cause adverse effects due to their reactivity and potential to form toxic metabolites.

Rule 4: The molecular weight and structural complexity of a molecule can influence its toxicity, with larger and more complex molecules generally showing higher toxicity potential.

Rule 5: Molecules that are cationic or have a positive charge in their structure tend to interact more with cellular components, which can lead to toxicity.

Rule 6: The presence of heavy metals or organic metal compounds (such as organic zinc salts or perchlorate salts) in a molecule's structure raises the potential for causing adverse effects due to their ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Rule 7: Molecules with amphipathic properties, meaning they contain both hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions, can disrupt cell membranes and potentially lead to toxicity.

Rule 8: Molecules that can form reactive oxygen species (ROS) or have groups that react with cellular constituents (such as thiol groups) are likely to be toxic.

Rule 9: Certain structural features, such as the presence of an aromatic ring fused to another heterocyclic ring or the substitution pattern on these rings, can impact the toxicity of a molecule, often leading to adverse effects.

Rule 10: Molecules with specific functional groups such as nitrosamines, formaldehyde groups, or long unbranched alkyl chains are associated with higher risks of adverse health effects due to their reactivity and potential to interfere with biological processes.
