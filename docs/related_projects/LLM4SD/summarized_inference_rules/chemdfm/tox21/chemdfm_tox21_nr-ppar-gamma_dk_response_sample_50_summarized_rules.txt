Rule 1: Molecules with aromatic rings containing chlorinated groups or other halogens are more likely to have adverse effects.
- Example: `Nc1ncnc(Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2)n1` and `CCOC(=O)C(C)(C)Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1`.

Rule 2: Molecules containing mercury atoms bound to cysteine show strong indications of potential adverse effects.
- Example: `CC[Hg]Sc1ccccc1C(=O)[O-]`.

Rule 3: Molecules with bulky substituents on aromatic rings may have increased likelihood of adverse effects.
- Example: `Cc1ccc(C2CC2)nc(Nc2ccccc2)n1`.

Rule 4: Molecules with carbonyl groups, especially when attached to aromatic rings, may increase the probability of adverse effects.
- Example: `COc1ccc(C(C)(C)C)c(OCC(=O)O)c1C#N`.

Rule 5: Aromatic amines and compounds containing nitro groups are strong indicators of potential toxicity.
- Example: `Nc1cccc(S(=O)(=O)O)c1` and `O=Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`.

Rule 6: Molecules with long hydrocarbon chains or complex structures like multiple ring systems or long side chains might present an elevated risk of adverse effects.
- Example: `CCCCCCC/C=C\C/C=C\CCCCCCCC(=O)OC`.

Rule 7: Presence of specific functional groups, such as ether, ester, amide, or thiol, increases the likelihood of adverse effects.
- Example: `OCC or COC(=O)c1cn2nc(OP(=S)(OCC)OCC)cc2nc1C`.

Rule 8: Molecules with functional groups prone to undergoing redox reactions, such as organic phosphates or sulfides, may have an elevated risk of toxicity.
- Example: `CCOP(=O)(OCC)OP(=S)(OCC)OCC`.

Rule 9: Molecules with hydrophilic functional groups, particularly those containing oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur, may reduce toxicity activity against nuclear receptors.
- Example: `OC[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)CO`.

Rule 10: Presence of aliphatic chains exceeding six carbons in conjunction with other risk-factor groups potentially intensifies adverse effects.
- Example: `CCCCCC/C=C\C/C=C\CCCCCCCC(=O)OC`.

These rules help compile a profile of molecular characteristics that might predict toxic or adverse effects in biological contexts, providing a guideline for chemical safety assessments.
