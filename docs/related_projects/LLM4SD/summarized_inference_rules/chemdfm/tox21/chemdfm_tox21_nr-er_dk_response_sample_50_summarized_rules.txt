Rule 1: Molecules with an acute toxicity value or estrogen receptor binding activity of 1 are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules with a molecular weight over 1000 Daltons or a logP value over 4 may have poor absorption, distribution, and possibly cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with negative or positive charges, particularly with aromatic rings or organic sulfate groups, respectively, may have higher toxicity potential.
Rule 4: Molecules with halogens like chlorine or bromine in aromatic rings or heavy metals such as nickel, chromium, or lead are likely to be toxic.
Rule 5: Molecules with carboxylic acid groups or multiple halogen substituents on aromatic rings are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: Molecules with a molecular weight of 300 or greater may be challenging for the body to clear, potentially increasing the likelihood of adverse effects.
Rule 7: Molecules with high lipophilicity and the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier are more likely to cause adverse effects.
