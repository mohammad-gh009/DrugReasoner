Rule 1: Molecules with halogens (especially chlorine and bromine) or heavy metals (like arsenic, cadmium, mercury, and lead) in their structure are associated with increased toxicity due to their potential to interact disruptively with biological molecules and cellular processes.

Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic amines, nitrogen mustards, or benzylic amines are likely to exhibit higher toxicity. These compounds can metabolize into reactive or carcinogenic intermediates, or directly interact with DNA, causing adverse biological effects.

Rule 3: The presence of functional groups such as ketones, aldehydes, or organophosphates, or structural features like aromatic rings and unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes), indicates a higher likelihood of a molecule being toxic. These features contribute to higher reactivity with biological systems, leading to potential cellular damage or disruption.

These rules provide a structure-based approach to assessing the toxicity potential of molecules, particularly those indicated in studies monitoring adverse effects through pathways like ATAD5 signaling responses to genotoxic stress.
