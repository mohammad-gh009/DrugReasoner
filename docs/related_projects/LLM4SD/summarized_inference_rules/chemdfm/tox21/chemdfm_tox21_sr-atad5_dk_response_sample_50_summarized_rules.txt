Rule 1: Molecules containing alkylating groups or arylating agents like chloroethyl groups or aromatic amines have a high potential to cause adverse effects due to their ability to react with DNA and cellular components.

Rule 2: Molecules containing heavy metals or metalloids such as lead, mercury, and arsenic are indicative of potential toxicity due to accumulation in the body and toxicity in organs like kidneys and liver.

Rule 3: Molecules containing functional groups involved in redox reactions or formation of free radicals, such as aromatic hydrocarbons, organic peroxides, and nitro compounds, can lead to oxidative stress and cellular damage, increasing the likelihood of toxicity.

Rule 4: Molecules with a positively charged nitrogen atom, a benzene ring fused to a five-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and an amine group, or an aromatic ring with a chlorine atom attached are predictive of adverse effects due to structural toxicity indicators.

Rule 5: Molecules with halogenated aromatic rings, multiple aromatic rings, or hydrophobic alkyl chains are associated with higher toxicity activity, particularly when these features increase molecular reactivity or bioaccumulation.

Rule 6: Molecules with aromatic amines either in para position to a nitro group or with chlorine substituents in meta or para positions are likely to be toxic, as shown by their structural association with known toxicants.

Rule 7: Molecules containing reactive electrophiles such as aldehydes, ketones, or electrophilic aromatic compounds (like nitroaromatics) might cause genotoxicity and cytotoxicity due to their reactivity with cellular macromolecules.

Rule 8: Presence of chlorinated aromatic compounds, polar functional groups, or other identified toxic functional groups like aromatic amines, increase a molecule's likelihood of being toxic due to the aforementioned molecular interactions or disruptions within biological systems.
