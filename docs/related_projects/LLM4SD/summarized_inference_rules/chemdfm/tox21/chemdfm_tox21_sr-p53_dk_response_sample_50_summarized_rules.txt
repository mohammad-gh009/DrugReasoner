Rule 1: Molecules containing aromatic amines with chloro substituents tend to be more toxic.

Rule 2: Molecules with carbonyl groups attached directly to benzene rings that contain amino groups also tend to be more toxic.

Rule 3: Molecules featuring aromatic amines alongside ring assemblies with chloro substituents generally indicate higher toxicity.
