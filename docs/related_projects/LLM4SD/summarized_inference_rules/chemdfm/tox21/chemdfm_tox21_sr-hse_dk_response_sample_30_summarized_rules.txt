Rule 1: Molecules containing aromatic amines or phenols are more prone to toxicity.
Rule 2: Molecules with halogens, particularly chlorine, are generally more toxic.
Rule 3: Molecules featuring aromatic rings combined with complex structures generally have increased toxicity.
Rule 4: The presence of organic sulfides or sulfoxides in a molecule increases the likelihood of toxicity.
Rule 5: Molecules with carboxylic acid groups or alcohols that can form covalent bonds have a higher probability of causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: Molecules that contain amino acid derivatives or specific ionizable groups may exhibit higher toxicity.
Rule 7: Molecules with reactive functional groups, such as alkylating agents or free radical generators, are considered more hazardous.

These rules highlight how various functional groups, complex structures, and specific moieties influence the toxicity of molecules, impacting their safety and environmental behavior.
