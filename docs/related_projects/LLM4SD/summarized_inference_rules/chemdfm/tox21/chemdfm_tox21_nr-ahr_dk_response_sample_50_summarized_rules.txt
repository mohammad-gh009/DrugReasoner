Rule 1: Molecules with an aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonistic activity can cause adverse effects. This is indicated by functional groups such as halogen substituents (bromine or chlorine) on aromatic rings or ring nitrogen with at least one nearby chlorine atom.

Rule 2: Molecules with carcinogenic potential can cause adverse effects. Structures that are labeled or structurally similar to known carcinogens (e.g., nitrogen mustards or aromatic amines) indicate a higher likelihood of being carcinogenic.

Rule 3: Molecules with genotoxic potential can cause adverse effects. Genotoxic substances include compounds with aromatic amines, nitro groups, or halogens particularly when these groups are part of complex aromatic systems.

Rule 4: Molecules containing heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, mercury, or cadmium have increased toxicity potential and can cause adverse effects due to their ability to disrupt biological processes and accumulate in living organisms.

Rule 5: Molecules with halogenated aromatic rings or multiple bromine substituents tend to be toxic, often due to their persistence as environmental pollutants and their potential to disrupt endocrine and other biological systems.

Rule 6: Molecules that contain specific functional groups like sulfones, nitrobenzenes, or alkylating groups such as -N(CCCl)CCCl indicate a higher likelihood of being toxic due to their reactive nature and ability to modify DNA or other cellular structures.

Rule 7: The molecular size and charge, particularly the presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom or a large hydrophobic region, can influence a molecule's ability to cause adverse effects by affecting its interaction with biological membranes and cellular components.

Rule 8: Molecules that can activate the nuclear receptor signaling pathway, particularly via binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, have a notable potential to cause adverse effects.

Rule 9: Molecules with a high octanol/water partition coefficient (Kow) tend to accumulate in biotic systems and exhibit higher levels of toxicity due to their increased potential to be stored in fatty tissues.

Rule 10: Structures with aromatic rings, especially if planar and halogenated, are indicative of potential toxicity due to their ability to intercalate with DNA and disrupt normal biochemical processes through mechanisms such as oxidative stress.
