Rule 1: Presence of halogens (e.g., chlorine, bromine, iodine) especially when bonded to an aromatic ring, suggests potential toxicity, often implying interactions with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.
Rule 2: Functional groups like nitro groups (-NO2), amino groups (-NH2), and carbonyl groups (C(=O)O) indicate increased chances of toxicity.
Rule 3: Planar structures or aromatic entities enhance molecule's likelihood to interact with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, potentially increasing toxicity.
Rule 4: Larger and more complex molecules generally display higher toxicity, but this is not definitive as smaller molecules can also be significantly toxic.
Rule 5: Presence of multiple or fused aromatic rings escalates interaction possibilities with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, increasing toxicity chances.
Rule 6: Unsaturated or aromatic bonds, such as C=C or C-H, elevate the moleculeâ€™s reactivity, enhancing its toxicity potential.
Rule 7: Analyze structural analogues for recurring patterns of toxicity to assess a molecule's toxicity.
Rule 8: Considering the molecule as a metabolite of a known toxic compound could be indicative of inherent toxicity due to its degradation products.
Rule 9: A molecule's intended use or application provides contextual insight into potential toxicity.
Rule 10: Presence of specific metal ions (e.g., chromium) in a molecule can initiate toxic effects through various mechanisms.
Rule 11: Presence of aromatic rings with chlorine substituents often found in pesticides and industrial chemicals, implies higher persistence and potential toxicity due to environmental stability.
Rule 12: Molecules containing carcinogenic potential or specific moieties like thiophosphate or aromatic amine groups indicate higher chances of causing adverse effects.
Rule 13: Molecules labeled with structural features (e.g., having a SMILES string indicating toxicity) or containing an aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist moiety suggest high likelihood of adverse effects.
Rule 14: Molecules with planar aromatic systems like benzene or naphthalene, especially those featuring halogen atoms or electrophilic groups, are predisposed to causing adverse effects due to their reactivity and metabolic activation.
Rule 15: Molecules with reactive features such as organic nitrogen compounds, sulfides, or phosphine oxides are noted for their potential to cause adverse effects due to their chemical behavior.
Rule 16: Presence of nitro, amino, thiol groups, or organophosphates correlates with increased likelihood of adverse effects, typically through reactive or toxic behavior.
Rule 17: Molecules with certain advantageous properties like carcinogenic potential, genotoxicity, or reproductive toxicity, characterized typically by disruptions in DNA, cellular processes, or hormonal functions, suggest potential for causing adverse health outcomes.
