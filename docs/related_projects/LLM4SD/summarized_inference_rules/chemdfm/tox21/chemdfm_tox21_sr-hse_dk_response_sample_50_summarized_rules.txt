**Rule 1:** Molecules containing halogens (like chlorine, bromine, iodine) or heavy metals (such as mercury or lead) tend to have increased toxicity. These elements are known to disrupt biological processes by binding to critical molecules within cells.

**Rule 2:** Molecules with large molecular size and complexity often exhibit higher potential for toxicity. This includes molecules with high molecular weight, extensive ring systems, or a significant number of atoms, which tend to have a greater affinity for biological targets.

**Rule 3:** The presence of specific functional groups or structural patterns such as multiple aromatic rings, double bonds, or nitro groups increases the likelihood of a molecule being toxic. These structural elements can indicate potential carcinogenic or genotoxic activity and may interfere with DNA and cellular functioning.

**Rule 4:** Molecules with high lipophilicity or those that can easily cross biological membranes are more likely to accumulate in tissues and organs, leading to potential adverse effects.

**Rule 5:** Molecules with specific structural features that can bind to and inhibit essential enzymes or receptors involved in critical biological processes can disrupt cellular homeostasis, leading to adverse effects.

**Rule 6:** Molecules that are known carcinogens or mutagens, or those with structures similar to such known toxic compounds, are more likely to cause adverse effects, highlighting the importance of historical and comparative data in toxicity prediction.

**Rule 7:** Structural motifs such as halogenated anilines, aromatic amines, and organotin compounds are particularly indicative of potential toxicity, often due to their stability and reactive nature, making them persistent in the environment and biologically active.

**Rule 8:** The presence of certain atom combinations or molecular topologies that are known to be difficult for the body to metabolize or excrete, such as complex macrocycles or densely substituted molecules, can lead to accumulation and toxicity.

Each of these rules ties back to the chemical nature of molecules and their interactions with biological systems, emphasizing the importance of thorough structural analysis in the assessment of potential toxic effects in new or untested chemicals.
