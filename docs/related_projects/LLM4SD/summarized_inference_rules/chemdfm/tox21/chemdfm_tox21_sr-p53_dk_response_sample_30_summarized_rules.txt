Rule 1: Molecules with halogenated aromatic compounds, particularly those containing chlorine or bromine, are more likely to have adverse effects.

Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic amines are associated with higher toxicity due to their potential to be metabolized into carcinogenic compounds that bind to DNA and cause mutations.

Rule 3: The presence of heavy metals or metal complexes in a molecule indicates potential toxicity, as these elements can cause damage to DNA and other cellular components.

Rule 4: Molecules with multiple aromatic rings, especially if they are fused or contain certain functional groups like nitro, cyano, or carbonyl groups, are more likely to be toxic due to their increased reactivity and ability to interact with biological systems.

Rule 5: The presence of organic sulfides or sulfoxides in a molecule's structure may decrease its likelihood of causing toxicity against specific pathways, such as the DNA damage p53-pathway in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.

Rule 6: Compounds with polar or ionic groups, particularly those with carboxylic acids, amines, or phosphates, exhibit higher toxicity potential due to their enhanced ability to interact with biological systems.

Rule 7: Molecules with structural features that interfere with cellular processes or metabolic pathways, such as those targeting the DNA damage p53-pathway or disrupting mitochondrial function, are generally more toxic.

Rule 8: Molecules that contain long carbon chain branches or multiple ring structures have an increased likelihood of causing adverse effects due to their complex interactions with biological systems.

Rule 9: The solubility, metabolism, and molecular size of a molecule can influence its toxicity, with highly soluble or large and complex molecules posing greater risk of adverse interactions within biological systems.

Rule 10: Structural elements like electron-withdrawing groups near aromatic rings or unsaturated bonds with certain functional groups increase a molecule's potential for causing adverse effects.
