Rule 1: Molecules with an aromatic ring that include strontium ions, aromatic amines, or chlorinated organic compounds (like PCBs or DDE) are more likely to cause adverse effects due to their ability to disrupt biological processes, react with DNA, or accumulate in the environment and organisms.

Rule 2: Molecules that have halogen atoms (such as chlorine, bromine, and iodine), or specific functional groups (like carbonyls or nitro groups), are likely to exhibit increased toxicity due to enhanced lipophilicity which facilitates membrane penetration and potential binding to biological receptors.

Rule 3: A molecule's likelihood of having estrogenic activity and causing adverse effects increases with the presence of aromatic rings, multiple bonds, organic solvents, or molecules that have estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain activity. These structures are often associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage.

Rule 4: The presence of heavy metals (like cadmium), positively charged nitrogen in heterocyclic rings, or sulfonamide groups in a molecule generally increases the possibility of toxic effects, ranging from endocrine disruption to neurotoxicity and mutagenesis.

Rule 5: Molecules that are bulky and lipophilic tend to cause more adverse effects, as they have a higher propensity for tissue and organ accumulation. This can lead to various long-term health issues.

Rule 6: Molecules containing benzoyl groups attached to trisubstituted imidazole, heavy atoms, silicon-containing compounds, or nitrogen-containing functional groups (e.g., amines and nitriles) are prone to cause adverse effects due to their structural reactivity and potential to form toxic metabolites or interfere with biological pathways.

These rules highlight the complex interactions between molecular structure and adverse health effects, emphasizing the importance of monitoring and regulating substances with these characteristics in environmental and health contexts.
