Rule 1: Molecules that engage with androgen receptors, demonstrated by attributes like binding affinity, are more likely to cause adverse hormonal effects such as prostate issues and hormone disruption.

Rule 2: Molecules containing chloride ions, as part of their structure, are known to posse toxicity particularly in respiratory and cardiac functions due to their effect when present in large amounts.

Rule 3: Molecules characterized by a high octanol-water partition coefficient, indication of high lipophilicity, are prone to easily cross cell membranes, thus having a higher potential for toxicity due to cellular accumulation.

Rule 4: Structures such as chlorination or bromination particularly at specific positions like the benzene ring of an aromatic compound are likely to result in adverse effects, emphasizing the role of halogenation in toxicity.

Rule 5: Presence of aromatic amines, especially if positioned para to an aromatic ring, tends to be associated with higher toxicity and severe health implications.

Rule 6: Molecules comprising multifused aromatic rings such as naphthalenes or anthracenes typically exhibit a higher likelihood of causing adverse health effects, due to their stable yet reactive nature.
