Rule 1: Molecules that bind to the estrogen receptor are more likely to cause adverse effects. This includes molecules with azo groups (-N=N-), bulky aromatic moieties, halogens, particularly chlorine, and compounds that disrupt estrogen receptor signaling pathways.

Rule 2: Molecules with certain functional groups such as aromatic amines, halogenated aromatic compounds, and carbonyl groups linked to aromatic rings indicate a higher toxicity risk. This group includes compounds with chemical structures involving chlorine, bromine, or aromatic ketone groups.

Rule 3: Molecules with structures known to react with DNA or exhibit high reactivity and toxicity, such as alkylating agents, epoxides, and acylating agents, present a higher risk for adverse effects.

Rule 4: Molecules with higher molecular weight and complex structures, including planar aromatic systems or multiple substituents that increase toxicological profiles like lipophilicity, are likelier to cause adverse effects.

Rule 5: Molecules that exhibit cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, reactivity, carcinogenic (mutagenicity) properties, or those that are endocrine disruptors are more likely to cause adverse effects. This includes molecules assessed through various regulatory databases, scientific literature, and both in vitro and in vivo testing.

Rule 6: Structural components like long carbon chains, aromatic rings with halogen substituents, sulfonic acid groups, amino groups, or heavy metals can enhance the likelihood of a molecule causing adverse effects if they are associated with disrupting cellular processes or are identified as agonists or antagonists in toxicity studies.
