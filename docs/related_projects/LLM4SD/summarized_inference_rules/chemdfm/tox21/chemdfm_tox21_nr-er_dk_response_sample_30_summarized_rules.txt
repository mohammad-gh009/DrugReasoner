Rule 1: Molecules that contain aromatic ketones or aldehydes are more likely to have estrogenic activity and cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules with halogenated aromatic compounds are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules containing amino acid structures or peptides may cause adverse effects if not properly metabolized.
Rule 4: Molecules with estrogen receptor binding activity are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: Molecules containing the Mo(=O)(=O)O group are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: Molecules that contain a phenyl group attached to a carbonyl group or an aromatic ring are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: Molecules with carcinogenic potential are indicated by labels as 1 in the dataset.
Rule 8: Molecules prone to chemical degradation, indicated by a label of 0, are more likely to break down into hazardous byproducts.
Rule 9: The presence of an estrogen receptor agonist/antagonist indicates a higher likelihood of adverse effects.
Rule 10: The presence of a genotoxic moiety increases the likelihood of adverse effects.
Rule 11: The presence of a toxic moiety increases the likelihood of adverse effects.
Rule 12: The presence of a chlorinated aromatic group increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 13: The presence of a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 14: The presence of a nitrogen atom next to a chlorine atom in an aromatic amide functional group increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 15: High lipophilicity, as indicated by a high log P value, tends to accumulate in fatty tissues leading to potential adverse effects.
Rule 16: Aromatic amines are metabolized to aryl hydrocarbons potentially leading to adverse effects.
Rule 17: Molecules containing halogens (bromine, chlorine) increase the reactivity, raising the likelihood of adverse effects.
Rule 18: Molecules containing an aromatic ring with oxygen or nitrogen atom and chlorine indicate possible estrogen receptor activity.
Rule 19: Molecules with a sulfonamide group bonded to a benzene ring likely indicate estrogen receptor activity.
Rule 20: Molecules containing a double or triple bond between a benzene ring and an alkane or alkyl halide suggest potential estrogen receptor activity.
Rule 21: Estrogen receptor binding affinity suggests increased risk of hormone-dependent cancers.
Rule 22: Aromatic amines can be toxic and may bioaccumulate.
Rule 23: LogP greater than 4 indicates potential solubility, permeability, and bioavailability issues leading to adverse effects.
Rule 24: Molecules with a negative logarithm of the activity coefficient for toxicity against estrogen receptors are less likely to have adverse effects.
Rule 25: Molecules with organic peroxides can be more likely to have adverse effects due to reactivity.
Rule 26: High count of chlorine atoms or aromatic rings increases the probability of adverse effects.
Rule 27: Presence of multiple functional groups (amines, alcohols, carboxylic acids) can increase the likelihood of adverse effects due to greater solubility and reactivity.
Rule 28: Molecules with electrophilic characteristics, due to positive charge, tend to be more toxic affecting DNA or other biological molecules.
