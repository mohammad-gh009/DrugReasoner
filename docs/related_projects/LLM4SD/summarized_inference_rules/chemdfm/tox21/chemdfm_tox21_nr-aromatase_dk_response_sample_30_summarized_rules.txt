Rule 1: Molecules containing aromatic amines, formaldehydes, or halogenated aromatic rings are likely to cause adverse effects. These groups are noted for their potential reactivity with biological molecules, causing toxicity through mechanisms like DNA damage or protein dysfunction.

Rule 2: Molecules with electrophilic moieties such as nitro groups, aldehydes, or carbonyls attached to an aromatic ring are associated with adverse effects. They can generate reactive oxygen species or react with nucleophilic sites in the body, leading to oxidative stress or inhibition of normal cellular functions.

Rule 3: Highly lipophilic molecules (with aLogP greater than 4) or those with large polar surface areas are likely to cross cell membranes or biological barriers like the blood-brain barrier, leading to toxicity issues such as neurotoxicity and interference in normal cellular processes.

Rule 4: Molecules that exhibit specific chemical reactivity, such as alkylating agents, oxidizing agents, or those capable of forming reactive metabolites (e.g., via epoxidation), are more likely to cause adverse effects due to their potential to modify DNA, proteins, and other vital cellular components.

Rule 5: Compounds with cationic (positively charged) species can interact adversely with cellular components, which are usually negatively charged (e.g., DNA, proteins), disrupting normal cellular activities and leading to toxicity.

Rule 6: Molecules containing heavy metals (e.g., platinum complexes) or certain metal ions pose a high risk of toxicity due to their ability to induce oxidative stress, disrupt enzyme functions, and cause DNA damage.

Rule 7: Compounds that mimic or block biological pathways, such as those that inhibit aromatase activity or other critical enzymes in hormone or signaling pathways, can cause systemic effects and hormonal imbalances, potentially leading to adverse health outcomes.

Rule 8: Molecular structures that allow easy passage through membranes due to their physicochemical properties (e.g., size, charge, hydrophobicity) are associated with higher toxicity risks due to potential accumulation and interaction with internal biostructures.

Rule 9: Molecules with structural features known to activate or bind to specific biological targets such as nuclear receptors, ion channels, or enzymes, are likely to have defined toxicological profiles, leading to possible adverse effects by disturbing those biological functions.

Rule 10: Compounds with complex molecular structures that exhibit multiple points of reactivity or that can form multiple interactions with cellular targets tend to show higher toxicity due to their broad and possibly unpredictable biological activity.
