**Rule 1:** Molecules containing halogens (chlorine, bromine, iodine) or organoboron compounds are associated with increased likelihood of adverse effects.

**Rule 2:** Molecules featuring unsaturated fatty acid esters and ethers are likely to cause adverse effects due to increased reactivity.

**Rule 3:** The presence of aromatic amines and amides in molecules significantly raises the probability of adverse health outcomes.

**Rule 4:** Molecules with structures including a benzene ring substituted with an amino group adjacent to a nitroso group ([N+](=O)[O-]) or trisubstituted carbon are prone to adverse effects due to potential metabolic activation and stability disruption.

**Rule 5:** Carrying a carbonyl group next to two aromatic rings, where at least one ring has a nitroso group substitution, enhances a molecule's potential to cause adverse reactions by modifying metabolic pathways.

**Rule 6:** Thiol groups attached to benzene rings substituted with an amino group or nitroso groups increase adverse effects risk, likely through mechanisms involving oxidative stress and enzyme inhibition.

**Rule 7:** Molecules with substituted aromatic rings featuring halogens, especially in pesticides and industrial chemicals, have a high potential for toxicity due to environmental persistence and bioaccumulation.

**Rule 8:** Molecules that directly disrupt biological processes such as enzyme function or DNA interaction, or those that modify key physiological pathways, significantly raise the risk of toxicity.

**Rule 9:** Molecules that bind to specific biological receptors or fit into cellular systems due to their particular chemical structures (e.g., ionizable groups or molecular chains fitting into cell receptors) are more capable of causing disturbances leading to adverse effects.

**Rule 10:** Presence of reactive functional groups (alkylators), complex conjugated systems with multiple rings, or certain persistent pollutants in the molecular composition elevates the toxicity risk.

**Rule 11:** Molecules recognized to interact with hormone receptors like the androgen receptor due to structure-specific bindings (e.g., cationic molecules, aromatic compounds with specific group substitutions) tend to exhibit higher potential for causing adverse effects like cancer or endocrine disruptions.

**Overall, these rules showcase that molecular toxicity is often tied to specific structural characteristics and functional groups that enhance interactions with biological systems or environmental stability, increasing their potential to disrupt normal physiological or ecological processes.**
