Rule 1: A molecule is BBBP if it contains aromatic amines.
- Aromatic amines are chemical structures characterized by a benzene ring with an amino group (-NH2) attached. Their inclusion in compounds is often indicative of BBBP properties.

Rule 2: A molecule is BBBP if it exhibits a planar or rigid structure with hydrophilic and hydrophobic balance and complex functional groups like carbonyl or hydroxyl groups.
- This rule takes into account the molecular geometry and chemical functionality that may play critical roles in BBB penetration by facilitating interactions such as hydrogen bonding with DNA, fitting well within DNA structures, or balancing interaction with biological membranes.

Rule 3: A molecule is BBBP if it contains multiple ring systems, particularly those involving aromatic rings and heterocyclic components, which enhance lipophilicity.
- This rule emphasizes the importance of the lipophilic character in the BBB penetration as ring systems like benzene, pyridine, or pyrimidine increase lipophilicity, thereby enhancing the moleculeâ€™s ability to permeate the blood-brain barrier.
