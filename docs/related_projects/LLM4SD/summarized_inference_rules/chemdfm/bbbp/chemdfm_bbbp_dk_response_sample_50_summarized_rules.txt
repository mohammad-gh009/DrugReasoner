Rule 1: Molecules predicted to be BBBP must contain aromatic amino groups such as phenol or aniline, as these can form hydrogen bonds and increase BBB permeability.

Rule 2: Molecules must have a molecular weight less than 500 daltons, as larger molecules have difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier due to size constraints.

Rule 3: Molecules should possess both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions, which improve both solubility and membrane permeability, facilitating BBBP.

Rule 4: Molecules should include heterocyclic structures like benzene or thiophene, which are common in many pharmacologically active compounds that cross the blood-brain barrier.

Rule 5: The molecule's structure should be planar with delocalized pi-electrons to enable efficient stacking interactions necessary for crossing the BBB.

Rule 6: Having low polar surface area (less than 60 A^2) is crucial as high PSA values tend to hinder BBB penetration due to increased solvation and polarity.

Rule 7: Presence of halogen atoms (e.g., Chlorine, Fluorine) on the aromatic rings increases lipophilicity and possibly BBB penetration, assuming no significant increase in molecular size or reactive sites that could hinder BBB crossing.

Rule 8: Compounds should not have heavy, bulky or highly polar groups that could significantly hinder their ability to be transported across the blood-brain barrier.
