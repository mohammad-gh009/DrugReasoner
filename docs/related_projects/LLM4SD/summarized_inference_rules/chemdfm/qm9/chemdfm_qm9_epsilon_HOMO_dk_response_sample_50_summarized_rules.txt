**Rule 1:** Molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to exhibit higher HOMO values due to electron delocalization.
- **Explanation:** The aromatic rings contribute to an increased stability and delocalization of electrons, raising the HOMO energy level.
- **Examples:** Molecules such as Nc1cn2c(c1N)CC2 and CC#CC1(C)C23CC12O3, which contain multiple aromatic or unsaturated rings, typically demonstrate higher HOMO values.

**Rule 2:** Molecules featuring electron-withdrawing groups such as nitriles, ketones, or halogens generally display lower HOMO values.
- **Explanation:** Electron-withdrawing groups pull electron density away from other parts of the molecule, reducing the ability to donate electrons and thereby lowering the HOMO value.
- **Examples:** Compounds like N#CC#Cc1ccn[nH]1 and CO[C@H]1C[C@]1(O)C1CC1, incorporate strong electron-withdrawing groups, influencing their HOMO values negatively.

**Rule 3:** The presence of heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur, especially when integrated into rings or near multiple bonds, tends to increase the HOMO values.
- **Explanation:** These atoms have lone pairs which can contribute to the electron density of the molecule, thus raising the HOMO energy level.
- **Examples:** Structures like Cn1cnc2c1C=CC2 and CC#CC1(NC=O)COC1 display heteroatoms positioned to affect their HOMO through electronic effects.
