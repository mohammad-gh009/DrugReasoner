Rule 1: Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g., C=C, C#N, C#CCC) tend to have higher G values due to the presence of pi-electrons.

Rule 2: Molecules containing positively charged nitrogen atoms, such as in primary, secondary, or tertiary amines, show higher G values owing to the partial positive charge on the nitrogen atom.

Rule 3: Molecules featuring hydroxyl (-OH) or carboxylic acid (-COOH) groups tend to have lower G values, attributed to polar functional groups capable of hydrogen bonding.

Rule 4: Molecules with multiple ring systems or intricate structures generally exhibit higher G values.

Rule 5: Molecules with nitrogen-containing functional groups (e.g., nitrile, amino) usually have high G values, which may increase the molecule's sensitivity to shock or heat.

Rule 6: Complex ring systems or multiple bonds between heavy atoms in molecules tend to elevate the G values, suggesting higher potential energy release during events like explosions.

Rule 7: The presence of multiple amino groups in molecules enhances the G value, likely due to multiple positive charges from protonated amino groups.

Rule 8: Molecules with aromatic amines or heteroaromatic amines often have high G values because the lone pairs on the nitrogen can form stabilizing conjugations with the aromatic system.

Rule 9: The existence of formal double or triple bonds in molecules correlates with higher G values because the pi-electrons in these bonds can form stabilizations.

Rule 10: Molecules possessing negatively charged species, like oxygen or sulfur atoms or groups, tend to have negative G values due to strong electrostatic interactions.

Rule 11: A greater number of aromatic rings or conjugated systems in a molecule typically suggests higher G values, linked to increased unsaturation and electron delocalization.

Rule 12: Molecules harboring charged species such as cations or anions generally showcase higher G values, attributed to increased reactivity and energy needed to break these molecules.

Rule 13: A greater number of functional groups containing oxygen leads to higher G values, possibly due to the electronegative nature of oxygen enhancing interactions like hydrogen bonding or dipole interactions.

Rule 14: Saturated bonds or simpler molecular structures in molecules lead to lower G values compared to their unsaturated or complex counterparts.
