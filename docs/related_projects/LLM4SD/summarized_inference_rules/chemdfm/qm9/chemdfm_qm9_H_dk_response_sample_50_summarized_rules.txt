Rule 1: Molecules with multiple heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur) usually have higher H values. Examples include C[C@@H](CNC=O) with high heteroatom content resulting in higher H values.

Rule 2: Molecules that contain aromatic rings tend to have higher H values compared to those without. Molecular examples include C[C@H]1OC2(COC2)[C@H]1C showing elevated H values due to the influence of aromatic structures.

Rule 3: Molecules with charged species (e.g., [NH-], [NH+]2CC2) or organic salts generally exhibit higher H values compared to neutral molecules. Presence of charged groups such as in CCNC(C)(C#N)C#N correlates with elevated H values due to the stabilization or destabilization effects by ionic charges.
