Rule 1: Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher R^2 values.
Rule 2: Molecules with unsaturated bonds (such as double or triple bonds) tend also to display higher R^2 values.
Rule 3: Molecules with charged species like ammonium ions generally exhibit higher R^2 values.
Rule 4: Molecules with multiple ring systems or complex structures are associated with higher R^2 values.
Rule 5: Molecules featuring functional groups such as carbonyl (C=O), hydroxyl, amino, or carboxyl tend to have higher R^2 values.
Rule 6: The presence of amino groups in molecules often correlates with higher R^2 values.
Rule 7: Molecules that are more basic, containing functionalities like amino or pyridinium groups, generally have higher R^2 values.
Rule 8: The presence of conjugated systems or aromatic rings elevates the R^2 values.
Rule 9: Molecules with polar functional groups including hydroxyl or amino groups, which can form hydrogen bonds, usually have higher R^2 values. 
Rule 10: Molecules that are more complex, featuring multiple unsaturated bonds and possibly cyclic structures, generally show higher R^2 values.
