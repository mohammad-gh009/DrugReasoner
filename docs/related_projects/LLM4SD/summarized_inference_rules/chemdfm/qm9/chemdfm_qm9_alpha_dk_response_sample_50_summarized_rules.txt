**Rule 1: Molecules containing positively charged nitrogen atoms generally exhibit high alpha values.**
- Examples: Molecules like [NH-][C@H]1COC2(CC2)CO1 and C[NH+]1CC1 demonstrate this trend due to the influence of positively charged nitrogen, which may enhance electronic interactions or stability, leading to higher alpha values.

**Rule 2: Molecules featuring aromatic rings or unsaturated bonds tend to display higher alpha values.**
- Examples: Structures such as C#C[C@H](C=O)OC=O and C#CC[C@@]1(C)C[C@@H]1OC incorporate aromatic or unsaturated systems which contribute to molecular complexity and stability, factors that can positively affect the alpha value.

**Rule 3: The complexity of a moleculeâ€™s ring system or the presence of multiple stereocenters generally correlates with higher alpha values.**
- Examples: Compounds like C1C[C@]23C[N@H+]2CC[C@@H]3O1 and C1[C@@H]2C[C@H]([NH+]3CC3)[C@@H]1O2, characterized by complex cyclic structures and multiple stereocenters, exhibit high alpha values as these features may enhance molecular rigidity and interaction potential.
