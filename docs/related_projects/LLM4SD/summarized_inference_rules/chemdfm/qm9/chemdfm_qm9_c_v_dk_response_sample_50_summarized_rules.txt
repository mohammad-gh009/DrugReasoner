Rule 1: Molecules with a higher number of double bonds exhibit higher Cv values. 
Examples: Molecules like C#CCc1nc(C)no1 and C#Cc1cnc(O)cn1, each with one double bond, demonstrate respective Cv values of 30.295000 and 27.528000.

Rule 2: Molecules with a lower molecular weight exhibit higher Cv values. 
Examples: C#CC[C@H](N)C1(O)CC1 with a molecular weight of 128.04 g/mol has a higher Cv value (37.395000) compared to c1c[nH]ccncnc1 with a molecular weight of 116.15 g/mol and a lower Cv value (28.688000).

Rule 3: Molecules including basic nitrogen atoms exhibit higher Cv values. 
Examples: Molecules C[C@@](N)(C#N)C1(O)CC1 and C[C@@H](O)CN[C@@H](C)C#N, each with one basic nitrogen atom, have high Cv values of 37.395000 and 38.797001 respectively, despite their differing structures.

Rule 4: Molecules with amino groups or nitrogen-containing rings generally exhibit lower Cv values than their counterparts without these groups. 
Examples: N#CCn1cc[nH]c1=O and Cn1nnc(N)c1O show lower Cv values, 27.673000 and 28.466999, respectively.

Rule 5: Molecules containing multiple ring systems or complex architectures tend to have higher Cv values. 
Examples: Molecules like [NH-]C1O[C@@H]2CC=C[C@]12O and Cc1cc(O)cc(F)n1 with complex structures, show higher Cv values of 29.271999 and 29.488001 respectively.

Rule 6: The presence of oxygen atoms in organic frameworks typically results in higher Cv values compared to those without them. 
Examples: Molecules like CO[C@@H]1[C@@H]2O[C@H]1[C@@H]1N[C@@H]12 exhibit higher Cv values like 29.195999.

Rule 7: The number of atoms, especially heavy atoms like nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur, influences Cv values with a greater count leading to higher Cv values. 
Examples: Increased Cv values are observed in molecules like N#C[C@@]12O[C@@H]1COC2=O compared to simpler molecules.

Rule 8: The polarity or ionizable nature of molecules affects their Cv values, with those having charged groups, polar bonds, or polar functional groups exhibiting higher values. 
Examples: Molecules such as C[N@H+]1[C@@H]2[C@H]1[C@@]1(C#N)C[C@@H]21 have been demonstrated to have higher Cv values.

Rule 9: Molecules with aromatic rings, multiple functional groups, or heteroatoms typically show higher Cv values than those without. 
Examples: Presence of aromatic rings or double bonds, as seen in molecules like Cc1cc[nH]nc1O, generally results in higher Cv values.

Rule 10: The presence of multiple stereocenters or chiral centers raises Cv values due to the increased structural complexity.
Examples: Molecules like C[C@@H]1C[C@H]2C[C@@H]2N1C exhibit higher Cv values reflecting their structural complexity.
