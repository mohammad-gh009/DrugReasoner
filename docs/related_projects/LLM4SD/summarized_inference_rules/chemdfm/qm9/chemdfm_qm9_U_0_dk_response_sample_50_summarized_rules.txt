Rule 1: Molecules containing multiple nitrogen atoms generally exhibit a higher U_0 value.
Rule 2: The presence of sp3 hybridized nitrogen atoms in molecules tends to be associated with higher U_0 values.
Rule 3: Aromaticity in molecules significantly contributes to higher U_0 values.
Rule 4: The inclusion of multiple heteroatoms such as N, O, or S in a molecule leads to a higher U_0 value.
Rule 5: Molecules featuring unsaturated bonds (e.g., C=O, C#C) exhibit higher U_0 values.
Rule 6: Bulky groups or extensive ring structures in molecules usually correspond to lower U_0 values.
Rule 7: Positively charged nitrogen atoms in molecules usually induce high U_0 values.
Rule 8: Molecules with an sp2-hybridized carbon next to a positively charged nitrogen atom show higher U_0 values.
Rule 9: An sp3-hybridized carbon adjacent to a positively charged nitrogen atom in molecules corresponds to lower U_0 values.
Rule 10: Molecules containing amino groups or positive charges generally have lower U_0 values compared to those without these features.
Rule 11: Complex structures or the presence of multiple functional groups in a molecule are indicative of higher U_0 values.
Rule 12: Multiple polar functional groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, or amino can lead to higher U_0 values.
Rule 13: Higher molecular weights in molecules correlate to higher U_0 values, due to increased intermolecular interactions.
Rule 14: Presence of carbonyl groups in molecules frequently results in higher U_0 values.
Rule 15: Organic heterocyclic rings within a molecule's structure lead to higher U_0 values.
Rule 16: The presence of an amino group tends to lower the U_0 value of a molecule.
