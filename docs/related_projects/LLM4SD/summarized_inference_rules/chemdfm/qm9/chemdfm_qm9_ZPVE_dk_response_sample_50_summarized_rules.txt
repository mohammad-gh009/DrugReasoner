Rule 1: Molecules with multiple bonds (e.g., C=C, C=O, C#C) generally have higher ZPVE values due to the stronger and more energy-storing nature of these bonds.
  
Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic rings usually exhibit higher ZPVE values because of the electron delocalization across the ring, which increases the molecule's stability and energy requirements.

Rule 3: Molecules featuring charged species or polar functional groups tend to have higher ZPVE values, likely due to the strong electrostatic interactions and greater molecular stability they confer.
