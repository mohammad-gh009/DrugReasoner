Rule 1: Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have a lower HOMO-LUMO gap due to the delocalization of electrons within the ring system.

Rule 2: Molecules with multiple bonds between non-CCN sp3 hybridized atoms (e.g., C=O, C=N) tend to have higher HOMO-LUMO gaps due to increased electron localization.

Rule 3: Molecules containing aromatic amines exhibit a lower HOMO-LUMO gap, attributed to the electron-donating nature of the amine group enhancing electron delocalization.
