Here are the summarized rules based on the provided molecule data and their corresponding U values:

**Rule 1:** Molecules containing amino groups (-NH2) or guanidinium ions (NH+) generally exhibit increased U values. This can be attributed to the interaction of these groups with solvents, which enhances solvation.
- **Example:** Molecules like Cn1ccnc(F)c1=O and COc1conc1O demonstrate higher U values due to the presence of amino groups.

**Rule 2:** Molecules featuring carbonyl groups (C=O or CO), particularly when protonated, often display decreased U values. The protonated carbonyl groups lose polarity, reducing interaction with the solvent.
- **Example:** Molecules such as C#CCC(C)(C)C(N)=O and CCOC[C@@H]1CO1 show lower U values when their carbonyl groups are protonated.

**Rule 3:** The presence of double bonds and aromatic rings in molecule structures influences U values by increasing polarity through delocalized pi electrons, resulting in enhanced solvation.
- **Example:** Molecules such as COc1nnoc1C=O and CCO[C@H]1CC[C@@H]1O1 have higher U values due to containing double bonds and aromatic rings. 

These rules indicate how specific molecular features, such as chemical groups and structural configurations, predictively influence the U values related to solvent interaction and molecular stability.
