Rule 1: Presence of aromatic rings generally increases molecule lipophilicity, influenced by the number and substituents like halogens.
Rule 2: LogD greater than 0 suggests higher lipophilicity, while less than 0 indicates hydrophilicity.
Rule 3: Functional groups like amides, halogens, and aromatic amines modify lipophilicity, usually enhancing it.
Rule 4: Polar functional groups such as hydrоxуl or carboxyl decrease lipophilicity by enhancing water interaction.
Rule 5: Molecules with a molecular weight and structural complexity tend to be more lipophilic due to increased hydrophobic surface interaction.
