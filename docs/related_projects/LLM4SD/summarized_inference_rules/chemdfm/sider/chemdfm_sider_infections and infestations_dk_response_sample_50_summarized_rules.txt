Rule 1: Molecules that include heavy metal atoms or heavy metals (such as gold, platinum, arsenic, or radium) in their structure are more likely to have adverse effects.

Rule 2: Molecules featuring aromatic ring systems, especially those substituted with halogens (such as chlorine, iodine, and fluorine) or containing phosphorothioate groups, are more likely to have adverse effects related to infections and infestations. 

Rule 3: Molecules with complex structures characterized by multiple aromatic rings, double bonds, long chain lengths, or the presence of multiple stereocenters or highly reactive functional groups (like guanidine, amines, carboxylic acids, or alkylating agents) have a higher likelihood of adverse effects. Additionally, the presence of specific toxic groups like nitro compounds, reactive oxygen species generators, or organophosphates enhances the risk of adverse effects. 

Rule 4: Molecules with properties that enhance their reactivity, such as an extended conjugated system or proximity of reactive groups to double bonds, can potentially cause adverse effects owing to unintended interactions with biological systems.

Rule 5: Lipophilicity and physicochemical properties such as solubility and stability are critical markers in assessing a molecule's potential for adverse effects. Molecules with high lipophilicity can accumulate in fatty tissues and potentially cross the blood-brain barrier, while reactive or unstable molecules might break down to form toxic byproducts.

Rule 6: The potential for a molecule to cause adverse effects is heightened if its structure is similar to known toxins or drugs, suggesting that it may share the same biological pathways and mechanisms of action, which could lead to toxicity.

These rules collectively help in predicting potential adverse effects based on chemical structures and properties, taking into account both direct structural features and the broader biological implications of those features.
