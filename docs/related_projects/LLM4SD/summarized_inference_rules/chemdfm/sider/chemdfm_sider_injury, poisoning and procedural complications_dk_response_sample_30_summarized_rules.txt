Rule 1: Molecules with aromatic or multiple ring systems are more likely to cause adverse effects due to metabolic activation and the formation of reactive intermediates.
Rule 2: Molecules containing specific functional groups such as alkylating agents, epoxides, carbonyls, and heavy metals are more likely to cause adverse effects by reacting with biological molecules like DNA and proteins.
Rule 3: The presence of non-biodegradable or slowly clearing complex molecules can lead to toxic accumulation, interacting with multiple biological targets and causing unintended consequences.
Rule 4: Highly lipophilic molecules are prone to cause adverse effects due to tissue and organ accumulation.
Rule 5: Molecules that can bind with high affinity to proteins or receptors disrupt normal physiological processes and thus more likely cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of reactive groups (e.g., alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters) in a molecule can lead to toxic reactions like irritation, allergies, or tissue damage.
Rule 7: Organic peroxides and other chemicals classes that can lead to toxic reactions like explosions or fires are predictive of adverse effects.

These rules encapsulate the characteristics of molecular structures (like aromaticity, complexity, reactive functional groups) and inherent properties (like lipophilicity, biodegradable nature, reactivity) that are commonly associated with the potential to cause adverse biological effects.
