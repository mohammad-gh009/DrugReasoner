Rule 1: Molecules containing toxic functional groups like heavy metals (e.g., lead, mercury), aromatic amines, or formaldehyde have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects due to their inherent toxic properties.

Rule 2: Molecules with high lipophilicity or substantial molecular weight may cause increased toxicity due to their ability to cross biological barriers easily and accumulate in the body, leading to prolonged exposure effects.

Rule 3: Structural features like the presence of unsaturated bonds and aromatic ring systems in molecules can enhance their reactivity and stability, increasing the potential for toxic interactions with cellular components.

Rule 4: The presence of reactive functional groups, including alcohols, amines, carboxylic acids, and thiols, can raise a molecule's propensity to cause adverse effects due to their abilities to partake in biological reactions.

Rule 5: Molecules that incorporate structural characteristics such as ring systems or conjugation are prone to higher reactivity, making them more likely to interact with biological systems in ways that can result in toxicity.

Rule 6: The presence of specific charge characteristics and solubility properties in molecules can influence their likelihood to cause adverse effects, as these factors affect how molecules interact with and are distributed within biological systems.

Rule 7: Molecules containing certain patterns or motifs known to interact with biological systems adversely (like extended conjugation or specific toxic substructures) may be predicted to cause harmful effects.

Rule 8: Physicochemical properties such as polarity, size, and stability play roles in determining a molecule's risk of causing toxicity, considering how these properties influence interactions within an organism.
