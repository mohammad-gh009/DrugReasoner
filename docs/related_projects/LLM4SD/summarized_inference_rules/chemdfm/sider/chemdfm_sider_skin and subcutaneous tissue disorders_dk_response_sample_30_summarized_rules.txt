Rule 1: Molecules that contain aromatic rings, specifically those with multiple conjugated double bonds, are likely to cause adverse effects due to their reactivity and interaction with biological systems.

Rule 2: Molecules with halogen atoms, particularly those like chlorine and fluorine, can cause adverse effects. These elements increase the reactivity of molecules which can lead to toxic interactions.

Rule 3: Molecules with specific functional groups such as carboxylic acids, amines, amides, and epoxides have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects. These groups are reactive and can interact negatively with biological components.

Rule 4: If a molecule has a high molecular weight or complex structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects. Such structures might have multiple active sites that can interact with biological targets in undesirable ways.

Rule 5: Molecules that are highly lipophilic tend to penetrate biological membranes and interact with cellular components, potentially leading to adverse effects.

Rule 6: Molecules containing certain ionizable species such as heavy metals or reactive oxygen species are prone to generate reactive intermediates that can damage cellular components and lead to toxicity.

Rule 7: Aromatic amines present in molecules are indicators of potential adverse effects such as allergenic or carcinogenic responses.

Rule 8: Molecules with organic heterotricyclic compounds can cause adverse effects, as these structures often have reactive sites that interfere with normal biological processes.

Rule 9: Presence of aromatic esters in a molecule increases the risk of irritant and allergic reactions, and potential reproductive toxicity.

Rule 10: Size and charge of a molecule, including its ability to carry metals like gadolinium, affect their potential to cause toxicity through biological interactions.

These rules are intended to be used as guidelines for preliminary screening and analysis. They are not absolute and should be combined with detailed chemical, biological, and toxicological assessments for accurate risk evaluation.
