Rule 1: Molecules containing specific toxic functional groups, such as chlorinated aromatic rings, heavy metals, or reactive epoxides, have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 2: Molecules with properties such as high lipophilicity or specific charge features (positively or negatively charged) are more prone to accumulating in body tissues or interacting with cell membranes and biological molecules, leading to potential toxic reactions.

Rule 3: Molecules belonging to certain chemical classes, such as corticosteroids or antibiotics, are associated with significant side effects, while others like vitamins are generally safer.

Rule 4: The presence of acidic functional groups like carboxylic acids or phenols within a molecule increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects due to their potential to irritate the GI tract lining.

Rule 5: The solubility of a molecule, especially its water solubility, impacts its absorption and distribution, influencing the likelihood of gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea or constipation.

Rule 6: A molecule's molecular weight and lipophilicity affect its absorption rate and potential to irritate the GI tract, influencing side effects like nausea and vomiting.

Rule 7: Reactive molecules containing groups like alkyl chains, acids, or aromatic systems are more likely to interact with biological systems and cause adverse effects.

Rule 8: The stability of a molecule under physiological conditions, such as susceptibility to hydrolysis leading to toxic metabolites, can significantly impact its safety profile.

Rule 9: Molecules with aromatic amines or aryl sulfides typically have higher chances of causing adverse effects.

Rule 10: The presence of bulky or complex groups in a molecule's structure can impede proper absorption by the GI tract and lead to digestive problems like constipation or diarrhea.

Rule 11: Positive traits such as hydrophilicity, smaller molecular weight, or the absence of reactive functional groups reduce the likelihood of adverse effects, promoting safer molecular interaction within biological systems.
