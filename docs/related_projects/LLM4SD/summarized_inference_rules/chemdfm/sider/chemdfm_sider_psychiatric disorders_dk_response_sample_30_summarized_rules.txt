Rule 1: Molecules containing heavy metal ions such as gadolinium are more likely to cause adverse effects due to their reactivity with biological systems.

Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic amino acids like tryptophan or tyrosine in their structure tend to cause adverse effects by interacting with and altering biological functions.

Rule 3: Molecules that include multiple halogens such as chlorine are more likely to cause adverse effects due to the reactive and toxic nature of these elements.

Rule 4: Molecules with smiles strings labeled as 1, indicating relevance to psychiatric disorder side effects, should be assessed for ADMET properties and toxicity using predictive tools such as Qikprop, TOPKAT, Drug Likeness Score, ToxicityPrediction@NN, and AdmetSAR.

Rule 5: The presence of phosphate groups, multiple aromatic rings or multiple double bonds in a molecule's structure may signal a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 6: High numbers of heavy atoms (like Ag, Pb, Cd, Hg, or As) in a molecule suggest a greater potential for causing adverse effects.

Rule 7: Specific functional groups like aromatic amines, acrylamides, or organic peroxides in a molecule heighten the risk of adverse effects.

Rule 8: Molecules structurally similar to known adverse effect-inducing molecules, such as those with specific hazardous functional groups or a high molecular weight and complexity, are likely to cause adverse effects. 

These summarized rules provide insight into identifying molecules that may lead to undesirable health effects based on their chemical structures and properties, enhancing safety assessments in chemical and pharmaceutical contexts.
