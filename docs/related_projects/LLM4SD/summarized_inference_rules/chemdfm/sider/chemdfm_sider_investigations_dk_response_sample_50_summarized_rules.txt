Here are summarized rules based on the given context:

**Rule 1**: Molecules containing positively charged nitrogen atoms or aromatic structures have a higher likelihood of causing side effects. These components are known for their reactive tendencies with biological molecules, leading to potential toxicity.

**Rule 2**: Molecules encompassing one or more aromatic rings are associated with potential side effects, as aromatic rings have properties that can interact abnormally with cellular components, thereby potentially disturbing biological processes.

**Rule 3**: Molecules that have a high number of heavy atoms or multiple aromatic ring systems are typically linked with side effects. The complexity and size may contribute to a molecule's toxicity, interaction with various cellular components, and difficulty in metabolic breakdown.

Together, these rules reflect the importance of a molecule's structural properties — such as the presence of specific groups like aromatic rings and charged atoms, as well as overall size and complexity — in determining the likelihood of side effects.
