Rule 1: Molecules containing heavy metal cores (e.g., [Pt], [Gd]) are more likely to cause adverse effects due to their toxicity.

Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic amino acids structures (e.g., tryptophan, tyrosine) are associated with higher risks of adverse effects.

Rule 3: Molecules featuring long hydrocarbon chains (e.g., alkyl chains, acyl chains) have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 4: Molecules with reactive functional groups like alkylating agents, free radicals, and electrophilic centers, often found in chloroacetate esters, epoxides, or carboxylic acid halides, are prone to causing toxicity.

Rule 5: Large and complex molecular structures, such as those in antibodies, peptides, or liposomes, are more likely to interact with multiple cellular targets and pose adverse effects.

Rule 6: Specific structural features like planar aromatic rings and long, flexible side chains increase the likelihood of a molecule to bind DNA or disrupt cell membranes, leading to toxicity.

Rule 7: Organic cationic species, aromatic systems, and molecules containing guanidinium ion are indicative of potential side effects in molecules.

Rule 8: Molecules bearing double bonds in the 1,2-position of an aromatic olefinic compound or aromatic ring systems with more than 6 rings are associated with side effects.

Rule 9: Aromatic systems with electronegative substituents (e.g. halogens) in specific positions often show a higher propensity for causing side effects.

Rule 10: Concern for adverse effects should also correlate with the presence of aromatic amines, organic phosphates, and organic peroxides in the molecular structure.

Rule 11: The presence of heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and arsenic in molecules significantly raises the potential for toxicity.

Rule 12: Functional groups like epoxides, alkynes, carbonyls, and aromatic double bonds in a molecule's structure generally predict an increased risk for adverse effects.

Rule 13: The stereochemistry of molecules, specifically the presence of chiral centers, may influence their biological activity and toxicity, affecting their potential to cause adverse effects.

Rule 14: The physicochemical properties of a molecule, including solubility, lipophilicity, and ionization state, are critical in determining the likelihood of adverse effects.

Rule 15: Halogen presence, especially chlorine and bromine, in molecules can signify a higher risk of adverse effects due to enhanced reactivity and toxicity.
