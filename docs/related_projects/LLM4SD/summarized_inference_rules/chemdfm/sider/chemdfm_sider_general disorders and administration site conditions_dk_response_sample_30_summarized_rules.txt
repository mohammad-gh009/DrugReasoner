Rule 1: Molecules containing heavy metals or reactive groups such as epoxides and ketones may cause adverse effects due to their potential for toxicity or side effects.

Rule 2: Molecules that possess reactive functional groups or moieties known to react with biological molecules, like unsaturated bonds, could lead to toxicities such as off-target effects or immune responses.

Rule 3: Molecules exhibiting specific properties like high molecular weight, hydrophobicity, or positive charge might have issues related to distribution, metabolism, or excretion, potentially elevating the likelihood of adverse effects.

Rule 4: Structural similarity to known toxic molecules suggests a higher chance of a molecule being carcinogenic or otherwise harmful.

Rule 5: The ability of a molecule to interfere with essential biological processes by binding to critical receptors or enzymes might trigger adverse effects.

Rule 6: High lipophilicity or a tendency to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) signifies a higher risk of toxicity, as these molecules can accumulate in tissues or cause cellular damage respectively.

Rule 7: Molecules presented with functional groups or moieties like aromatic rings fused together, or multiple double bonds are likely to be more reactive and potentially more harmful.

Overall, understanding the structural features, reactive potential, molecular properties, and biological interactions of molecules can help predict their likelihood of causing adverse effects.
