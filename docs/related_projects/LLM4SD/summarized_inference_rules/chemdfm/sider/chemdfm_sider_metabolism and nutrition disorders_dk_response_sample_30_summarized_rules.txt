Rule 1: Molecules that contain aromatic rings, multiple double bonds, or electrophilic groups are more likely to cause side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders.

Rule 2: Molecules with complex structures, including a high number of stereocenters and chiral centers, tend to be associated with side effects due to potential interactions with various biological pathways.

Rule 3: The presence of specific reactive functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, acids, epoxides, halogens, and heavy metals in a molecule increases the likelihood of adverse effects, since these groups can react with biological molecules or accumulate in tissues.

Rule 4: Physicochemical properties such as lipophilicity, solubility, and a molecule's ability to form reactive metabolites influence its potential to cause adverse effects. Highly lipophilic or unstable molecules pose a higher risk of toxicity.

Rule 5: Molecules similar in structure to known toxicants or drugs with known side effects are more likely to have adverse effects. Structural similarity could suggest similar biological interactions and effects.

Rule 6: A molecule's potential to interfere with DNA, RNA, or protein function, whether through reactive groups or binding to biological macromolecules, can lead to adverse effects. This includes molecules that mimic or inhibit regular physiological molecules.
