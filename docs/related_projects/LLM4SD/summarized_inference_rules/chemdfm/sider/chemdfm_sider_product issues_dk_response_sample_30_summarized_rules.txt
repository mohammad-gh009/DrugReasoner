Based on the provided text analysis and example lists, here is a consolidated summary of the rules used to predict whether a molecule can cause adverse effects:

**Rule 1:** Molecules with aromatic rings and extended conjugation, indicated by the presence of multiple double bonds, have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects. This structural feature increases reactivity and interaction potential with biological systems.

**Rule 2:** The presence of halogen atoms (such as chlorine or bromine) in the structure of a molecule is an indicator of potential toxicity. These elements can contribute to the reactivity and persistence of a molecule in biological systems, leading to toxic effects.

**Rule 3:** Molecules containing specific functional groups such as carbonyls, epoxides, aldehydes, and ketones are more likely to cause adverse effects due to their reactivity with cellular components leading to cellular damage and toxicity.

**Rule 4:** Heavy metal ions in a molecule suggest potential adverse effects due to their ability to interact disruptively with biological systems or accumulate in tissues, causing long-term damage.

**Rule 5:** The complexity and size of a molecule play a role in potential toxicity, with larger and more complex molecules often having a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects because of their capacity to interact with multiple biological targets and pathways.

**Rule 6:** The presence of aromatic amine groups or metal coordination complexes in molecules is associated with increased likelihood of adverse effects, often due to toxic metabolites formed during metabolism or direct reactivity.

These rules are derived from structural and chemical properties that commonly associate with toxicity, extracted from examples and discussions within the text provided.
