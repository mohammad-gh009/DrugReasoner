Rule 1: Molecules with aromatic amine groups or fused aromatic rings are more likely to cause adverse effects due to their potential reactivity and interaction with biological systems.

Rule 2: Molecules containing certain functional groups known to be toxic, such as aromatic amines, halogens, ketones, and aldehydes, have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 3: Greater molecular size and complexity in a molecule can enhance its possibility of adverse effects, as it increases the potential for interactions with multiple biological targets.

Rule 4: Molecules with reactive functional groups or unstable structures, including multiple bonds and reactive oxygen species (ROS) precursors like disulfides, are prone to causing adverse effects by reacting with cellular components.

Rule 5: Molecules with a high number of halogen atoms, heavy metals, or other electronegative elements are more likely to cause adverse effects, often due to their reactivity and potential toxicity.

Rule 6: Molecules with a positive charge or high lipophilicity, which favor accumulation in tissues and interaction with biological membranes, often result in higher toxicity.

Rule 7: Structural similarities with known allergens or toxins can indicate a higher likelihood of a molecule causing adverse effects as they may mimic or interfere with biological pathways in harmful ways.

Rule 8: Certain structural properties, such as long hydrocarbon chains and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, can lead to higher toxicity due to issues like bioaccumulation and disruption of cellular membranes.
