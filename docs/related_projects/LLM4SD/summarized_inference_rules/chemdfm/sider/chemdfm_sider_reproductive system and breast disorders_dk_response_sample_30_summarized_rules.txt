Rule 1: Molecules with hormone-like structures or those similar to hormones such as estrogen and testosterone are likely to exhibit hormone-related activity, impacting the reproductive system and breast disorders.

Rule 2: Molecules that have planar aromatic structures like benzene or naphthalene rings can interfere with hormonal signaling pathways.

Rule 3: Molecules containing reactive functional groups (e.g., alkylating agents or free radical generators) can react with cellular macromolecules, potentially causing reproductive system and breast disorders.

Rule 4: Molecules exhibiting structural features like [Se]=Se group (S=[Se]=S) often relate to side-effect activity due to their possible role in immunosuppression.

Rule 5: Molecules with structures that feature aromatic systems with more than four conjugated double bonds are associated with side-effect activity due to possible photosensitization reactions.

Rule 6: Molecules that include functional groups such as alkyl halides, aryl halides, or organic phosphates are good indicators of potential side-effect activity due to toxic properties.

Rule 7: Molecules with specific functional groups or motifs linked to adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders include estrogenic or androgenic compounds and endocrine disruptors.

Rule 8: Molecules showing particular molecular properties like size, charge, and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity affecting their interaction with biological targets can influence toxicity and adverse effects.

Rule 9: Genetic or epigenetic factors, which affect molecule metabolism, distribution, or elimination, can modify the toxicity of a molecule.

Rule 10: The presence of unsaturated bonds or aromatic rings in the molecular structure can suggest a higher likelihood of adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders due to enhanced reactivity and hormonal interference.

Rule 11: Molecules that often contain aromatic rings or double bonds tend to exhibit estrogenic activity, impacting reproductive and breast health.

Rule 12: The presence of halogens (like chlorine or bromine) in a moleculeâ€™s structure can increase its reactivity, leading to undesirable interactions within the body.

Rule 13: Observing heavy metals or specific functional groups (e.g., esters, ketones) in the molecule's structure can signal a potential for adverse effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders.

Rule 14: Molecular recognition of features such as multiple fused aromatic rings, halogens, or specific reactive groups like alkylating agents, epoxides, and free radicals are predictors of potential adverse effects due to interactions with DNA or key biomolecules.

Rule 15: Structural analysis revealing molecular features like heavy metal complexation or binding with biomolecules could indicate possible adverse reproductive and breast health effects.
