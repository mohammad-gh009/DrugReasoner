Rule 1: Molecules containing heavy metals or radioactive isotopes are likely to cause adverse effects due to their toxic nature.
Rule 2: Molecules featuring aromatic amines or halogenated anilines in their structures are associated with adverse effects, reflecting their potential toxicity and reactivity.
Rule 3: Molecules with multiple quaternary ammonium or guanidinium ions can also result in adverse effects, possibly due to their interaction with biological membranes or systems.
Rule 4: Presence of more than six aromatic rings increases the potential for toxicity in a molecule, possibly due to enhanced environmental persistence and bioaccumulation.
Rule 5: Molecules incorporating heterocyclic rings like thiophenes, pyridines, and pyrimidines are more likely to induce toxicity, potentially interfering with biological processes.
Rule 6: Any molecular structure with planarity is prone to causing side-effects, likely due to the ability of such molecules to intercalate or bind tightly with biological macromolecules.
Rule 7: Molecules containing a planar ring attached to another aromatic structure heighten the risk of side effects due to the increased stability and reactivity of such configurations.
Rule 8: The presence of organic cations or anions in a molecule indicates a higher risk of toxicity, perhaps due to their disruptive interactions with cellular components.

These rules underscore the complex interplay of molecular structure and biological activity, emphasizing the need for careful assessment and testing of molecules for safety in pharmaceutical and chemical applications.
