Here are the summarized rules based on the provided context:

Rule 1: Molecules containing aromatic amines or phenols are likely to have side effects.
Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic rings substituted with halogens are prone to causing side effects.
Rule 3: Molecules featuring multiple ring systems or complex structures tend to have adverse effects.
Rule 4: Molecules with aromatic amines are also associated with vascular disorders.
Rule 5: Molecules containing multiple bonds and aromatic rings are likely to cause vascular disorders.
Rule 6: Molecules with long carbon chains and multiple double bonds are likely linked to vascular disorders.
Rule 7: The presence of reactive functional groups like epoxides and carbonyls in molecules may signal potential adverse effects.
Rule 8: Physicochemical properties such as high lipophilicity or molecular weight in a molecule might lead to toxicity.
Rule 9: A structure containing aromatic amides or bulky complex functionalities tends to be associated with adverse effects.
Rule 10: Molecules with a high overall charge or containing nitro groups in aromatic rings are likely to cause vascular disorders.
