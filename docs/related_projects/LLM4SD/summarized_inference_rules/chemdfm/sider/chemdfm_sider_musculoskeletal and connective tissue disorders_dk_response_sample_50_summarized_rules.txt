Here are the synthesized rules for predicting if a molecule can cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:

**Rule 1:** Molecules that contain aromatic amines, aromatic nitro compounds, or halogens such as chlorine and bromine are more likely to cause adverse effects due to their potential toxicity and reactive nature.

**Rule 2:** Molecules with larger size and higher complexity (e.g., multiple aromatic rings, long carbon chains) are more likely to interact with various biological pathways and targets, increasing the possibility of adverse effects.

**Rule 3:** The physical and chemical properties of a molecule, such as solubility, stability, and reactivity, influence its potential to cause toxicity. Molecules that are unstable or highly reactive are prone to decompose or react in harmful ways, affecting their safety profile.

**Rule 4:** Molecules with specific functional groups like carbonyl, carboxylic acids, and metal coordination complexes have a higher likelihood of causing side effects, particularly if they interact with biological systems disruptively.

**Rule 5:** Utilizing in silico and in vitro methods to predict toxicity can provide preliminary insights into a molecule's likely impact, allowing for adjustment or rejection before extensive in vivo testing.

**Rule 6:** Molecules containing peptides, unsaturated five-membered heterocyclic moieties, or multiple stereocenters in specific side-effect activity datasets (e.g., musculoskeletal disorders) have a raised likelihood of negative outcomes based on historical data trends.

**Rule 7:** Structural similarity to known adverse-effect-causing molecules is a critical indicator, particularly if they share functional groups or motifs previously identified as risk factors.

Each rule is designed to use identifiable molecular characteristics to estimate potential health risks, contributing to safer pharmacological and chemical product development.
