Rule 1: Molecules structurally similar to known neurotoxins or neuroactive drugs can have neurotoxic effects.

Rule 2: Molecules containing neurotoxic functional groups or atoms, such as heavy metals or reactive organic groups like epoxides or carbonyls, are more likely to exhibit neurotoxicity.

Rule 3: Molecules that interfere with neurotransmission or disrupt neuronal function, such as those blocking acetylcholine receptors or sodium channels, likely exhibit neurotoxic effects.

Rule 4: Molecules with functional groups prone to reacting with biological molecules, such as aldehydes, ketones, or epoxides, have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system.

Rule 5: Molecules that can interact with biological molecules due to electrical charge or polarity could lead to adverse nervous system effects.

Rule 6: Molecules with certain patterns or functional groups identified as commonly associated with nervous system adverse effects, such as structures containing nitrile, chloroacetamide, or specific solvents, raise concerns for potential toxicity.

Rule 7: Molecules with acetylcholine esterase inhibitors or molecules mimicking or inhibiting neurotransmitter function can alter normal neurological processes, potentially causing adverse effects.

Rule 8: Molecules with metal ions or heavy metals (e.g., lead, mercury, cadmium) incorporated into their structure can bind with biological entities like DNA or proteins, leading to mutations or cell death which causes neurotoxicity.

Rule 9: Molecules containing aromatic amines, organic sulfides, or forming metal coordination complexes or organic cations suggest greater potential for side-effect activity related to the nervous system.

Rule 10: Molecules with a high Heavy Atom Count (HAC), substantial molecular weight, or significant lipophilicity (high LogP values) are more prone to causing side effects, likely due to better penetration and accumulation within the nervous system.

Rule 11: Molecules exhibiting structural similarities to neurotoxic compounds, ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, or containing functional moieties known for toxicity aid in predicting potential neurotoxic effects.

Rule 12: Presence of specific toxicity-associated features such as certain functional groups (amines, alcohols, thiols), molecular weight, or complex molecular structures are general indicators that a molecule might pose risks of adverse effects.
