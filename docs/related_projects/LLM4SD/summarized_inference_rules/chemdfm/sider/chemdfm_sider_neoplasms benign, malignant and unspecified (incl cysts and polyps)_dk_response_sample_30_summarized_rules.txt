Rule 1: Molecules containing known toxically functional groups, like alkylating agents, epoxides, or carbonyls, have a higher likelihood to cause adverse effects.

Rule 2: Molecules that possess physical properties such as high solubility, lipophilicity (logP), molecular weight, or positive charge are more likely to exhibit adverse effects due to stronger biological interactions.

Rule 3: Molecules exhibiting structural or chemical similarities to known adverse effect-causing compounds, particularly those with multiple aromatic rings, halogens, or reactive groups, tend to have increased likelihood of causing harmful effects.

Rule 4: Certain molecular interactions, including the ability to bind and inhibit key enzymes or receptors, or generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), could indicate a propensity for causing adverse effects.

Rule 5: Machine learning algorithms and statistical methods used to analyze large datasets of structural and pharmacological information can help in predicting potential adverse effects based on identifying patterns and relationship between molecular features and toxicity.

Rule 6: Molecules with aromatic amines, aromatic sulfides, or multiple bonds within an aromatic system generally indicate a higher probability of associated side effects.

Rule 7: Molecules specifically structured with a thiocarbonyl group, a disulfide bond, or a positively charged nitrogen atom located next to an aromatic ring are more likely correlated with neoplasm-related side effects. 

Rule 8: The pharmacokinetics of a molecule, including how quickly it is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted, can also significantly affect its potential to cause adverse effects, with those exhibiting rapid elimination posing less risk.

Rule 9: Molecules that structurally mimic or contain elements of known toxins or carcinogens, especially those with benzene rings fused to heteroarenes or carry positively charged cations, are more likely to inflict adverse effects. 

Rule 10: Adverse effects are more probable in molecules with high molecular weights, reactive oxygen species generating functions, metal ion chelating capabilities, or slow clearance rates.
