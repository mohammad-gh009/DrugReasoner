Rule 1: Molecules containing reactive functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, acids, or specific moieties like halogens (chlorine, bromine) increase the likelihood of adverse effects due to their high reactivity and potential tissue irritation.

Rule 2: Molecules that are large, complex, with multiple aromatic rings, charged groups, or heavy metals (like lead, mercury, arsenic) are more likely to interact adversely with biological systems due to their size, shape, charge distribution, and inherent toxicity.

Rule 3: The presence of specific structural elements known to engage in adverse biological interactions, such as long conjugated systems, multiple double bonds, or cyclic structures, increase a moleculeâ€™s risk of causing side effects due to their stability and reactivity potentially leading to oxidative stress or disruption of normal cellular functions.

Rule 4: Molecules with a high degree of unsaturation or specific groups (like nitro, sulfide, or phosphates) known for their toxicity have a higher chance of causing adverse effects based on their chemical reactivity, potential to form reactive intermediates, or known historical data on their biological impact.

Rule 5: The physical and chemical properties such as solubility, electronic structure, and ability to penetrate cell membranes affect a molecule's potential for toxicity. Molecules that are highly lipophilic or have abnormal charge distributions are likely to interact with cell membranes or internal cellular components, leading to potential toxicity.

Rule 6: Molecules known to interact with or modulate key biological pathways or molecules (like DNA, enzymes, or cell receptors) through their structural characteristics (e.g., aromatic amines, polycyclic systems) are likelier to cause adverse effects due to their potential to alter normal biological functions or cause direct damage to critical biomolecules.
