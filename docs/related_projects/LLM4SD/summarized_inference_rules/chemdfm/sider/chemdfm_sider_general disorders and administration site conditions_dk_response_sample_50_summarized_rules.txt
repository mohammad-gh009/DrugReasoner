Rule 1: Molecules with aromatic or heterocyclic rings are likely to cause adverse effects due to their metabolic persistence and interactions with biological molecules.

Rule 2: Molecules containing reactive functional groups (e.g., halogens, alcohols, amines, carboxylic acids) are prone to causing adverse effects through tissue irritation or more severe toxic reactions due to interactions with cellular components.

Rule 3: Large and complex molecules (bigger molecular weight and size) tend to cause more adverse effects as they have potential for multiple interactions within biological systems and can be difficult for the body to metabolize and eliminate.

Rule 4: Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms or other halogens increase the likelihood of adverse effects due to their high toxicity and ability to interfere with biological processes.

Rule 5: Molecules that are highly charged or polar may disrupt biological systems and thus are more likely to lead to adverse effects.

Rule 6: Presence of specific toxic functional groups or motifs like halogenated compounds, heavy metals, or organic peroxides predict higher adverse effect probability.

Rule 7: Molecular features simulating known harmful drugs or chemicals (e.g., structural similarities to toxic compounds) indicate a higher likelihood of causing liver toxicity or other organ-specific damage.

Rule 8: Molecules containing charged groups or large hydrophobic regions are problematic, as they can disrupt biological pathways or receptors, leading to increased side effects.

Rule 9: Poor absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion (ADME) properties in a molecule suggest a higher risk of adverse effects due to poor bioavailability and prolonged exposure.

Rule 10: Structural attributes leading to high reactivity (e.g., multiple bonds, aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups) escalate the chances of adverse reactions due to increased potential to form covalent bonds with biological molecules.

Rule 11: Molecules mimicking key biological compounds (like enzymes or receptors) may interfere with normal physiological processes, potentially leading to toxicity or adverse drug reactions.
