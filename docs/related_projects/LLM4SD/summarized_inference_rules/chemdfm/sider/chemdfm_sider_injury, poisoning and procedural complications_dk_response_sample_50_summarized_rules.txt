Rule 1: Molecules with multiple aromatic rings, reactive functional groups, and a high molecular weight are likely to be associated with side effects due to their structural complexity and potential for non-specific interactions with biological systems.

Rule 2: Molecules with positively charged heterocyclic rings and high numbers of halogen substituents are associated with increased risk of side effects due to increased lipophilicity and potential interference with healthy tissues.

Rule 3: Molecules with a significant number of unsaturated bonds, such as double or triple bonds, and those that include heavy atoms (e.g., halogens) or fused rings, are more likely to exhibit side-effects owing to their reactivity and the potential to form harmful intermediates during metabolic processes.
