Rule 1: A molecule is likely to cause adverse effects if it contains structures or functional groups known to interact negatively with biological systems, such as planar tricyclic structures, aromatic rings, halogens, or heavy metals.

Rule 2: A molecule is more likely to cause adverse effects if it possesses specific chemical properties or motifs such as high reactivity, a long half-life, the presence of reactive groups (e.g., alkylating agents, epoxides), or if it binds strongly to healthy cells or tissues.

Rule 3: The potential for adverse effects increases if a molecule has structural or physicochemical characteristics that enhance its interaction with biological targets, such as high lipophilicity, complex structures, or the presence of unsaturated fatty acid chains, aromatic amines, and heteroatoms like nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen.

Rule 4: The size, shape, and metabolic stability of a molecule can influence its likelihood of causing adverse effects. Large, complex molecules with multiple aromatic systems and the ability to bind enzymatic or receptor sites are typically more prone to causing adverse outcomes. 

Rule 5: The presence of certain functional groups, such as organic salts, amines, alcohols, carboxylic acids, and specific structural features like double bonds and bulky structures, can indicate a higher risk of adverse health effects.

Rule 6: A molecule's ability to cause adverse effects can also be related to the similarity of its structure to known toxins or venoms, the presence of unusual amino acid sequences, or abnormal post-translational modifications if it is a peptide, protein, or antibody.
