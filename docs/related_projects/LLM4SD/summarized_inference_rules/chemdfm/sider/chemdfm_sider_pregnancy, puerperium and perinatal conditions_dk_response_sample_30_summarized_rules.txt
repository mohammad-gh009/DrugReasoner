Here is a summary of the rules inferred from the context provided:

**Rule 1**: Molecules with structures similar to known side-effect-causing drugs, such as thalidomide, are likely to have similar side effects.

**Rule 2**: Molecules containing reactive functional groups like alkylating groups, epoxides, or other groups that can damage DNA or cellular components are likely to exhibit mutagenic or carcinogenic effects.

**Rule 3**: Molecules having charged or polar groups that can disrupt cellular processes or interact disruptively with other drugs might cause adverse effects.

**Rule 4**: Aromatic compounds, particularly those with benzene rings, are known to be carcinogenic and can pose additional health issues such as birth defects and neurological disorders.

**Rule 5**: Compounds containing multiple chlorine atoms are more likely to cause tissue and organ damage due to chlorine's toxic properties.

**Rule 6**: Molecules with high molecular weight or complex structures may exhibit more side effects due to interactions with multiple targets in the body or difficulties in breakdown and elimination.

**Rule 7**: The presence of heavy metals like lead, mercury, or arsenic in a molecule suggests potential toxicity.

**Rule 8**: Molecules with multiple aromatic rings or large polycyclic structures tend to be more toxic, potentially interfering with cellular processes.

**Rule 9**: Positively charged molecules are more likely to disrupt cell membranes and cause cell death.

**Rule 10**: Molecules that show structural alerts such as aromatic amines, ketones, and nitro compounds often associated with carcinogenicity should be treated with caution.
