Rule 1: Molecules with reactive groups such as alkylating agents, metal-chelating agents, or free radical generators are likely to cause neurological disorders.

Rule 2: Neurotransmitter analogues or drugs that abnormally interact with neurotransmitter receptors can cause adverse effects on the nervous system.

Rule 3: Molecules that abnormally modulate the activity of neurotransmitters, hormones, or neuromodulators in a sustained manner can lead to chronic neurological disorders.

Rule 4: Molecules containing organophosphate groups or fluorine atoms can be neurotoxic due to their reactivity and impact on biological systems.

Rule 5: Reactive functional groups like ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, or carboxylic acids in molecules can lead to unintended side effects through biological interactions.

Rule 6: Molecules with aromatic rings, double bonds, or charged atoms (positively charged nitrogen or negatively charged sulfur/oxygen atoms) show increased reactivity and potential for unintended biological interactions.

Rule 7: Molecules containing halogen atoms or long non-polar alkyl chains are also likely to have adverse effects on the nervous system.

Rule 8: Specific structural features like planar ring systems, highly conjugated systems, or the presence of aromatic/heterocyclic amines or amides in a molecule's structure predict potential neurotoxic effects.

Rule 9: Physicochemical properties like solubility, lipophilicity, and overall molecular size and shape can affect a moleculeâ€™s interaction with biological systems and its potential toxicity.

Rule 10: The presence of metal ions, complex aromatic ethers, or organic acids in molecules highlights a potential for adverse effects related to the nervous system.
