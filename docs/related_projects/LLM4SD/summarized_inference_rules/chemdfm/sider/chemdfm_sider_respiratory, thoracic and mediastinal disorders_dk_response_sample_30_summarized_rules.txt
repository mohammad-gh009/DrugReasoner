**Rule 1:** Molecules containing heavy metals or toxic elements such as thallium or gadolinium are likely to cause adverse effects.

**Rule 2:** Molecules with certain reactive functional groups (e.g., halogens like chlorine, bromine, or iodine; aldehydes; ketones; carboxylic acids; aromatic amines) are more likely to be toxic or interact adversely with biological processes.

**Rule 3:** Molecules that incorporate structures like aromatic rings or multiple conjugated double bonds, which are planar and can interfere with biological systems, are associated with increased toxicity and side effects.

**Rule 4:** The complexity and size of molecules, especially those with high molecular weight or multiple aromatic rings, may enhance their potential for causing adverse effects due to interactions with multiple biological targets.

**Rule 5:** Molecular structures with basic amino groups, guanidinium groups, alcohols, or acidic groups such as carboxylic or sulfonic acids are indicators of potential respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders.

**Rule 6:** Molecules that are bulky or complex, such as large polycyclic compounds, peptides, and proteins, are more prone to causing adverse effects.

**Rule 7:** The presence of specific functional groups or moieties that have a known association with toxicity, such as aromatic amines, halogenated aromatic groups, or toxic metals, serves as a warning for potential adverse effects.

**Rule 8:** Organically complex and unsaturated structures like olefinic or acetylene groups in molecules may also correlate with adverse effects, based on their reactivity and interaction behaviors in biological systems.

These rules provide insights into the structural and chemical nature of molecules which potentially lead to adverse biological effects, guiding in the prediction of molecule toxicity based on their structure and properties with a focus on respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders.
