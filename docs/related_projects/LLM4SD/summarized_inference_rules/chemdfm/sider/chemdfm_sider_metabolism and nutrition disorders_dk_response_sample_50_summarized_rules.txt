Rule 1: Molecules containing aromatic amines are more likely to cause adverse effects due to their potential to act as haptens, eliciting an immune response.

Rule 2: Molecules featuring carbonyl groups are more likely to cause adverse effects through reactions with amino groups in proteins, altering molecular properties and potentially leading to toxicity.

Rule 3: Molecules with heteroarene structures like thiophene, furan, or pyrrole are more likely to cause adverse effects due to their unique electronic properties, potential carcinogenicity, and high reactivity with biological systems.

Rule 4: Molecules containing heavy metals such as manganese, technetium, or iron are likely to lead to toxicity due to the inherently toxic nature of heavy metals.

Rule 5: The presence of functional groups such as acetate and phosphate can indicate an increased likelihood of a molecule causing toxicity.

Rule 6: Large molecules with a high degree of hydrophobicity or charge can disrupt cellular processes by crossing cell membranes, possibly leading to toxicity.

Rule 7: Molecules with extensive conjugated pi-electron systems such as those found in benzene or naphthalene rings are prone to form reactive oxygen species, causing oxidative stress and cellular damage.

Rule 8: Molecules with alkylating groups, such as epoxides or chloroacetyl groups, are capable of reacting with DNA, potentially causing mutations and cancers.

Rule 9: Molecules capable of binding and inhibiting key enzymes disrupt metabolic processes and can result in organ dysfunction and wider systemic toxicity.

Rule 10: The molecular structure similar to known metabolites but lacking in or adding certain functional groups can interfere with normal metabolic processes, potentially leading to adverse effects.

Rule 11: The net positive charge of a molecule enhances its interaction with negatively charged biological molecules, which can disrupt cellular function and lead to adverse outcomes.

Understanding these rules helps in predicting and mitigating the risks associated with molecular structures in drug development and environmental health science.
