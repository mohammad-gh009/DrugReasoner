Rule 1: Molecules that contain aromatic rings, especially when fused with other rings or containing halogens, are more likely to cause adverse effects due to their interaction with biological systems and potential to form reactive metabolites.

Rule 2: Molecules with reactive functional groups such as epoxides, aldehydes, ketones, and acyl chlorides are likely to cause adverse effects due to their high reactivity, which can lead to toxic interactions with cellular components.

Rule 3: Large and complex molecules with high molecular weight and multiple functional groups are more likely to cause adverse effects. Their size and complexity may hinder metabolic breakdown, leading to accumulation and toxicity in the body.

These rules highlight the importance of molecular structure in the assessment of potential toxicity and adverse effects, emphasizing the role of aromatic systems, reactive groups, and overall molecular size and complexity.
