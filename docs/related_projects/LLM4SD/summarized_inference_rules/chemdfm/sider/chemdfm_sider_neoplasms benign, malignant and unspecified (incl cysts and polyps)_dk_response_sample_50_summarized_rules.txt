Rule 1: Molecules containing certain functional groups or structures associated with toxicity, such as aromatic amines, epoxides, and large molecular weights, are likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 2: Molecules with physical or chemical properties such as high solubility, a high partition coefficient (LogP), and significant molecular flexibility are more likely to be absorbed by the body, leading to potential toxicity.

Rule 3: Structural similarities to known toxicants, as identified through chemical databases or machine learning algorithms comparing molecular structures, can indicate a higher likelihood of a molecule causing adverse effects.

Rule 4: Molecules with characteristics like aromatic rings, positive or negative charges, and bulky or complex structures have a higher risk of interacting undesirably with biological systems and, thus, causing adverse effects.

Rule 5: Reactive groups such as alkylating agents, electrophilic groups (e.g., alpha, beta-unsaturated ketones/aldehydes), and large or complex molecular structures are predictive of higher side-effect activity.

Rule 6: Molecules that generate or interact with reactive oxygen species (ROS), have hydrophobic regions, or contain heavy metals or halogen atoms, are also more likely to result in adverse effects.

Rule 7: Molecules with planar aromatic systems, multiple aromatic rings, or other specific structural features like charged species can disrupt normal cellular processes or bind undesirably to biological targets, suggesting a potential for toxicity.
