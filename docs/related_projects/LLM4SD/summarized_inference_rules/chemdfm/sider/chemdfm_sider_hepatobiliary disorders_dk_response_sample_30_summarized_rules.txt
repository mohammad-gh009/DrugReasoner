Rule 1: Molecules with long hydrophobic tails and positive charge are more likely to cause adverse effects due to potential disruption of cell membranes and biological processes.

Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic rings are more likely to cause adverse effects because they can interfere with various biological processes including enzyme activity and DNA replication.

Rule 3: Molecules that contain halogens like fluorine or chlorine are more likely to cause adverse effects due to the formation of reactive species that can damage cells and tissues.

Rule 4: Molecules with heavy metal cores (e.g., platinum or gadolinium) are more likely to cause hepatobiliary disorders due to their toxicity profiles.

Rule 5: Molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to cause hepatobiliary disorders, possibly due to increased persistence and toxicity.

Rule 6: Molecules with a high count of carbon-carbon double bonds may more likely cause hepatobiliary disorders, potentially from increased reactivity or bioaccumulation.

Rule 7: Molecules containing aromatic amines often lead to hepatotoxicity due to the formation of reactive intermediates during metabolism.

Rule 8: Halogenated aromatic compounds are prone to causing hepatotoxicity as they metabolize to reactive intermediates.

Rule 9: Molecules with unsaturated fatty acids can cause liver damage indicated by elevated serum aminotransferase levels.

Rule 10: Molecules that are too large or heavy may cause adverse effects by struggling to cross biological membranes and interact with sensitive tissues.

Rule 11: The presence of certain toxic functional groups or motifs (e.g., benzene rings, heavy metals) suggests higher likelihood of adverse effects.

Rule 12: Specific structural features like halogenated compounds and aromatic amines signal higher potential for instability and toxicity.

Rule 13: Minds-altering drugs and psychoactive compounds are inclined to cause hepatobiliary disorders related to their side-effect profiles.

Rule 14: Steroids and steroid derivatives tend to cause hepatobiliary disorders due to their complex interactions within the body.

Rule 15: Structural complexity of molecules correlates with likelihood of adverse effects due to potential unexpected interactions within the body.  

Rule 16: Reactive functional groups increase the likelihood of undesired interactions and adverse effects within the body.

Rule 17: Strong binding affinity to biological targets like enzymes or receptors can lead to significant biological interruptions and adverse effects.

Rule 18: Molecules with bulky side chains or long hydrocarbon tails are generally more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 19: Presence of multiple halogens or organic heterotetracyclic rings significantly raises the risk of hepatobiliary side-effects.

Rule 20: The presence of peptide linkages in molecules predicts higher potential for hepatobiliary disorder side effects due to interactions in liver processing.

Rule 21: Molecules with formal charges on sulfur atoms indicate a higher likelihood of hepatobiliary disorder-related side effects.

Rule 22: The identification of specific hazardous classes within a molecule, such as carcinogens or endocrine disruptors, helps predict adverse effects.

Rule 23: The presence of halogens, aromatic amines, and reactive groups in molecules indicate an increased risk of adverse effects due to their reactive nature and interaction with biological components.

Rule 24: The presence of heavy metal ions in a molecule significantly raises its potential to cause adverse effects due to heavy metal toxicity.

Rule 25: Examination of a molecule's relationship to hepatobiliary disorders can help determine its potential to cause adverse effects based on known problematic structures like aromatic rings or carbonyl groups nearby.
