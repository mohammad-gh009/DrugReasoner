Rule 1: Molecules with aromatic amines, aromatic hydrocarbon groups, cyclic ketones, or carboxylic acid groups attached to aromatic rings, and those containing nitrogen in heterocyclic compounds like imidazole or pyridine, are more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 2: Molecules featuring functional groups such as guanidine, organic heterocyclic compounds with an oxygen atom, or intricate structural features like smiles strings indicating side-effect activity, and those with formal charges on nitrogen atoms indicate a higher potential for adverse effects.

Rule 3: Chemicals containing specific structural classes such as those with multiple aromatic rings, long carbon chains, double bonds, conjugated systems, or organic cations are at an escalated risk of causing respiratory, thoracic, or mediastinal disorders.

Rule 4: Molecules possessing charged species, polar molecules, metal chelating functional groups, hydroxamic acid groups, solubility, or high lipophilicity demonstrate an increased likelihood of adverse effects.

Rule 5: Molecules including halogens, phosphate groups, cyano groups, positively charged nitrogen atoms, alkylating agents, or aromatic ethers are implicated in a higher propensity to induce side effects.

Rule 6: Molecules with extensive arrays of specific moieties indicative of thoracic, respiratory, or mediastinal side-effect activity, structures with high log P values, or sizable complex molecular frameworks might have potent side effects due to interactions with biological targets or accumulation within the body.
