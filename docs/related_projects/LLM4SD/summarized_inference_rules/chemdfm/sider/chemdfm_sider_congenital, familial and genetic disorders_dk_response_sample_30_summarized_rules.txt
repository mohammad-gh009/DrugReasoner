**Rule 1:** Molecules containing highly reactive functional groups or groups that can form highly reactive intermediates, such as aldehydes, ketones, acids, and bases, are more likely to have adverse effects due to their potential to produce toxic byproducts.

**Rule 2:** Aromatic structures, particularly those with aromatic rings or multiple double bonds, increase a molecule's propensity for oxidation, reduction, or other reactive transformations, which can lead to toxicity.

**Rule 3:** Molecules with extensive surface areas or high lipophilicity exhibit an increased affinity for biological membranes and tissues, which can result in toxic effects.

**Rule 4:** Molecules that specifically bind to receptors or enzymes within the body can trigger adverse effects depending on the nature of their interaction and the biological context, highlighting the importance of target-specific interactions.

**Rule 5:** The incorporation of halogens or heavy metals into a molecule's structure enhances its reactivity and toxicity, as these elements can participate in redox reactions that produce harmful species.

**Rule 6:** Larger and more complex molecular structures entail a wider array of possible interactions with biological systems, potentially increasing the likelihood of adverse effects due to the complexity and size of the molecule.

**Rule 7:** Specific functional groups or structures known for their toxicity, such as formaldehyde or asbestos, are indicative of potential adverse effects. 

**Rule 8:** Impurities or contaminants within a molecule can modify its intended biological activity, contributing to its potential for adverse effects. Each impurity's interaction must be considered to fully assess a molecule's safety. 

**Rule 9:** Molecules with structural features similar to known drugs or toxins might mirror the pharmacological activities or side effects of these substances, adding another layer of complexity to predicting toxicity.  

**Rule 10:** Analyzing the physicochemical properties of a molecule, such as lipophilicity, molecular weight, and solubility, offers insights into its interaction with biological systems, helping predict potential toxicity. 

These rules are not exhaustive and should be integrated with other evaluative methods like in vitro assays and clinical data to comprehensively assess the potential adverse effects of a molecule. The multifactorial nature of molecular interactions necessitates a holistic approach to toxicity prediction.
