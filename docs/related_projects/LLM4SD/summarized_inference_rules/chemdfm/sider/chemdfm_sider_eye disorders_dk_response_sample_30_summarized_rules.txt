Rule 1: Molecules containing known toxic moieties such as heavy metals (e.g., gadolinium, mercury), reactive functional groups (e.g., aldehydes, epoxides), or specific chemical bonds (e.g., nitrogen mustard bond) are more likely to show adverse effects.

Rule 2: Molecules with structural features that enhance reactivity or biological interaction, such as aromatic rings with halogens, multiple chiral centers, or compounds with extended conjugation, are associated with a higher likelihood of causing adverse reactions.

Rule 3: The size, complexity, and overall physical-chemical properties (such as charge, polarity, and solubility) of a molecule also determine its toxicity potential. Molecules with large, hydrophobic, or highly charged structures are more likely to penetrate cell membranes and disturb biological systems, thereby potentially leading to adverse effects.

Rule 4: Molecules that exhibit structural similarities to known adverse-effect causing compounds are likely to have similar adverse profiles. Using databases of known adverse molecules for comparative analysis can help predict the safety of compounds.

Rule 5: Molecules that contain functional groups or substructures like aromatic amines, epoxides, carbonyls, or halogenated compounds have a heightened potential for adverse effects due to their inherent reactivity or ability to disrupt biological systems.

Rule 6: The presence of flexible molecular structures or multiple stereoisomers can lead to unpredictable interactions with biological targets, often resulting in adverse effects. 

These guidelines provide a science-based approach to predict the toxicity and potential adverse impacts of molecular structures on biological systems.
