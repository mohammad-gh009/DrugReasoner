**Rule 1**: The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule increases the likelihood of side effects due to their stability and reactivity.

**Rule 2**: Molecules with halogens (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine) are more likely to cause adverse effects, potentially due to their reactivity and persistence in biological systems.

**Rule 3**: The presence of functional groups known to be toxic, such as alkylating agents or heavy metals, indicates a higher risk of adverse effects.

**Rule 4**: Structural complexity such as multiple ring systems, bulky groups, or a high number of double bonds can increase the potential for adverse effects by promoting interactions with multiple target sites in the body.

**Rule 5**: Positive charges or polar groups (like amine groups) increase a molecule's likelihood to interact negatively with biological systems, potentially leading to toxicity.

**Rule 6**: Molecules with higher molecular weights and poor solubility might accumulate in body tissues and cause toxicity due to their slow elimination from the body.

**Rule 7**: Molecules that mimic or interfere with biological signaling, such as those mimicking neurotransmitters or hormones, can cause adverse effects by altering normal physiological pathways.

**Rule 8**: The presence of reactive oxygen species generators or highly electrophilic groups suggests a higher potential for causing cellular damage and oxidative stress.

**Rule 9**: Molecules with properties that allow them to cross biological barriers (like the blood-brain barrier) facilitate interactions with sensitive tissues, thus potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects.

**Rule 10**: Molecules whose structures are similar to known toxins or have functional groups associated with toxicity (such as epoxides, carbonyls, and halogens) are more likely to have adverse effects.
