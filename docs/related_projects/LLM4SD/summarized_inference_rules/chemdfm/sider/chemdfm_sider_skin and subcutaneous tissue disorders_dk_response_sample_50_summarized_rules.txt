Rule 1: Molecules containing specific functional groups such as quinolines, amino acid residues, or metals tend to exhibit toxic effects due to their reactivity with biological systems.

Rule 2: High lipophilicity and substantial molecular weight in a molecule can enhance tissue accumulation leading to toxicity. Molecules with properties that allow them to easily integrate and persist in biological tissues tend to disrupt normal cellular functions.

Rule 3: Structural complexity and the presence of multiple aromatic rings in molecules can be associated with a greater likelihood of unintended side effects, mainly due to increased opportunities for interactions with various biological targets.

Rule 4: Reactive functional groups like alcohols, carboxylic acids, and aldehydes within molecules interact with cellular components, leading to toxic effects or unintended biochemical reactions.

Rule 5: The presence of halogens (e.g., chlorine, fluorine) on a molecule increases its lipophilicity and ability to penetrate cell membranes, which can enhance toxicity by facilitating more profound interactions with cell components.

Rule 6: Positive charge or high aromaticity in a molecule is associated with toxicity since such features promote interactions with cellular substances, potentially disrupting normal cellular activities or leading to cell damage.

Rule 7: Aromatic amine groups in the molecular structure are indicators of potential side effects due to their stability and capacity to form strong interactions with biological targets. 

Rule 8: Halogenated double bonds such as vinylidene chloride in a molecule's structure signal potential adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.

Rule 9: The presence of heavy atoms like silver or lead typically signals a potential for toxicity, particularly when involved in complex structural motifs that interact with biological systems.

Rule 10: Polar and heavily charged molecular structures increase the likelihood of side effects due to their strong interactions with biofluids and tissues, affecting normal cellular functions. 

These rules provide a basic framework to preliminarily gauge the potential for adverse effects in molecular structures, facilitating early-stage evaluations in drug development and toxicological assessments.
