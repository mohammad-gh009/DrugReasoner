Based on the provided context and information on molecules and their structures associated with adverse effects, the following summarised rules can be inferred:

**Rule 1:** Molecules containing aromatic heterocycles, such as pyridines or pyrimidines, are more likely to cause adverse effects due to their planar structure contributing to reactivity and potential toxicity.

**Rule 2:** Molecules incorporating heavy metal ions or other toxic metals can increase the likelihood of adverse effects stemming from these ions' harmful impacts on organs and system functions.

**Rule 3:** Molecules with multiple reactive functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, amines, alcohols) that can interact are more prone to cause adverse effects due to the formation of toxic byproducts from unwanted reactions.

**Rule 4:** Molecules characterized by a significant number of double bonds or aromatic rings are associated with increased risks of hepatobiliary disorders.

**Rule 5:** The presence of chlorine atoms or other halogens in a molecule tends to elevate the likelihood of side effects related to hepatobiliary disorders.

**Rule 6:** High molecular weight and structural complexity in a molecule correlate with a higher probability of adverse side effects related to hepatobiliary disorders.
