Rule 1: A molecule is likely to cause adverse effects if it contains reactive groups such as aldehydes, ketones, acids, or epoxides, which can interact with cellular components and cause toxicity.

Rule 2: A molecule is likely to cause adverse effects if it contains aromatic amines or amides, as these compounds can be metabolized into carcinogenic compounds or cause protein damage through cross-linking.

Rule 3: A molecule is more likely to cause adverse effects if it possesses a high degree of unsaturation, planarity, or contains multiple rings, as these features enhance the moleculeâ€™s ability to interact with DNA or other cellular targets.

Rule 4: The presence of heavy metals (such as mercury or lead) or metal ions (like gadolinium or strontium) in a molecule increases the risk of causing adverse effects due to their toxic properties and ability to bind with biological molecules.

Rule 5: Molecules with large or complex structures and those containing long carbon chains or bulky groups are likely to cause adverse effects due to their potential to interfere with biological processes or accumulate in tissues.

Rule 6: The presence of specific functional groups known to generate reactive oxygen species (such as peroxides) or act as electrophiles (such as alkylating agents) can signify a higher likelihood of a molecule causing adverse effects.

Rule 7: A molecule that contains charged or polar groups, especially if amphiphilic (possessing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions), is more prone to interacting with cell membranes and other biological structures, which can lead to adverse effects.

Rule 8: Structural features indicative of particular chemical classes like phosphorodiamides or nitrogen mustards suggest a higher likelihood of adverse effects, especially if the molecule is a known pesticide or chemotherapy agent.

Rule 9: The molecule's electronic structure, especially if it includes features like a high number of rotatable bonds or a planar ring system with delocalized pi-electrons, influences its interaction with biological systems and can impact its toxicity.

Rule 10: Molecules that inherently possess features making them capable of bioaccumulation (due to lipophilicity or large molecular weight) or that have slow metabolic or excretion rates are likely to have long-term adverse effects.
