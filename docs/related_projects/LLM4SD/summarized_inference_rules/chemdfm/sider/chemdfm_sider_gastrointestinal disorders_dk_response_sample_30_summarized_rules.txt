Rule 1: Molecules containing reactive functional groups (e.g., epoxides, carbonyls, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols) are more likely to cause adverse effects due to their reactivity with biological molecules such as DNA and proteins.
 
Rule 2: The presence of aromatic amines, halogenated aromatic rings, or multiple unsaturated bonds in molecules increases the likelihood of adverse effects, including toxicity and carcinogenic potential.

Rule 3: Molecules with polar or ionizable functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, halogens like chlorine and bromine) are associated with higher risks of adverse effects, impacting their interaction with biological systems.

Rule 4: Molecules with specific structural features such as multiple ring systems, high lipophilicity (logP > 3), or complex aromatic systems enhance the probability of adverse effects due to increased stability, bioavailability, and interaction with biological targets.

Rule 5: The physicochemical properties of a molecule, including solubility, lipophilicity, and molecular weight, influence its ability to cause adverse effects by affecting its distribution within biological compartments and interaction with cellular targets.

Rule 6: The structural complexity and three-dimensional shape of a molecule can determine its interaction with biological targets, influencing its potential to cause adverse effects, particularly if the molecule exhibits high rigidity or flexibility leading to off-target interactions. 

Rule 7: Molecules that undergo extensive metabolism can generate reactive intermediates that contribute to toxicity, with metabolic pathways assessed using in silico tools to predict metabolite reactivity.

Rule 8: Molecules with specific functionality or motifs associated with toxicity, like alkylating agents or heavy metal ions, suggest a potential for DNA damage and cellular toxicity.
