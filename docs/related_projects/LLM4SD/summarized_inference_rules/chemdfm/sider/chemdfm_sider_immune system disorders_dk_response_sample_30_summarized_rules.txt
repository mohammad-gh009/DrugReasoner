**Rule 1**: Molecules with multiple aromatic rings or double bonds are more likely to cause adverse effects due to their higher reactivity, which can lead to unpredictable interactions with biological systems.

**Rule 2**: Molecules containing halogens, especially fluorine, have an increased likelihood of causing adverse effects since these highly electronegative atoms can alter the overall properties of the molecule, leading to harmful interactions.

**Rule 3**: Presence of certain functional groups like amines, carboxylic acids, and alcohols in molecules raises the risk of adverse effects as these groups can interact with biological systems in various harmful ways.

**Rule 4**: Larger and more complex molecular structures are more prone to causing adverse effects since they can potentially interact with multiple biological targets, leading to varied unintended side-effects.

**Rule 5**: Molecules with charged species, like ions and electrons, can interact disruptively with other molecules and ions in biological systems, potentially causing adverse effects.

**Rule 6**: Molecules with a heavy metal ion bound to a chelating group pose a risk for adverse effects on the immune system due to the potential for these metals to bind to and disrupt normal cellular processes.

**Rule 7**: The presence of specific reactive or toxic functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, acid chlorides, or epoxides indicates a higher probability of adverse effects because these groups can react with biological molecules like DNA or proteins, resulting in damage or dysfunction.

**Rule 8**: Structural resemblance to known toxins or allergens suggests that a molecule may also carry similar toxic or allergenic properties. This includes molecules with structural components like specific ring systems or substituents associated with toxicity.

**Rule 9**: Molecules containing specific functional groups such as amides, carboxylic acids, and phosphates indicate an increased likelihood of causing adverse effects related to the immune system, given that these groups can be biochemically active or reactive.

**Rule 10**: If a molecule displays characteristics that significantly deviate from those observed in compounds known to be safe, such as unusual size, electronic properties, or reactive functionalities, it may be more likely to exhibit adverse effects.
