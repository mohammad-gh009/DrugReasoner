Based on the information provided from various scenarios and contexts, here is a concise synthesis and simplification of the rules that can be used to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects:

**Rule 1:** Molecules that possess heavily modified or substituted aromatic rings, such as those containing multiple halogen atoms (e.g., chloride, bromide), or reactive groups (e.g., aromatic amines, carboxylic acids), are more likely to cause adverse effects due to increased reactivity and potential toxicity.

**Rule 2:** Molecules with complex, large, or highly conjugated structures are more likely to cause adverse effects as they can be challenging for the body to break down and eliminate, potentially leading to accumulation and toxicity.

**Rule 3:** Molecules containing functional groups known for toxicity (e.g., certain halogens like chlorine or bromine, heavy metals like mercury or lead, or reactive oxygen species-generating groups) are more likely to cause adverse effects due to interactions that cause cellular damage or interfere with biological functions.

These rules highlight the significance of a molecule's structural features and functional groups in determining its potential to cause adverse biological effects. Understanding these patterns aids in predicting toxicity and guiding safer molecular design in therapeutic and chemical applications.
