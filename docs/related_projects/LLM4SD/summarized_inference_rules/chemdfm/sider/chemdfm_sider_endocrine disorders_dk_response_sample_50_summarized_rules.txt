Rule 1: Molecules containing specific hazardous functional groups or motifs such as halogens, aromatic rings, or reactive groups (e.g., double bonds, carbonyl groups) are more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 2: Molecules with complex structures, including multiple functional groups, chiral centers, or ring systems, have a higher likelihood of interacting with numerous biological targets, potentially leading to adverse effects.

Rule 3: Molecules resembling known harmful compounds, either by structure similarity or by containing specific toxic functionalities such as aromatic amines or heavy metals, are likely to cause similar adverse effects.

Rule 4: Molecules with a high lipophilicity or those carrying charges (positive or negative) tend to be more reactive and can disrupt biological systems, leading to toxicity.

Rule 5: Compounds with functional groups known to be metabolically unstable (like epoxides, aldehydes) are prone to forming reactive intermediates which can elicit toxicological responses.

These synthesized rules are based on patterns observed from provided molecule structures and their relation to potential adverse health effects, capturing the likelihood of toxicity through structural and chemical properties.
