Rule 1: Molecules containing planar aromatic systems, extended conjugation, or high numbers of double bonds or aromatic rings show a higher likelihood of causing side effects.

Rule 2: Molecules featuring aromatic amines, long hydrocarbon chains, or close proximity between aromatic ring systems and aromatic amines are often associated with renal and urinary disorders.

Rule 3: The presence of groups with high electric charge or heavy metal ions in molecules typically leads to side effects related to the cardiovascular and central nervous system.

Rule 4: Molecules with structures containing halogens, metals, or multiple conjugated bonds commonly cause side effects related to renal and urinary disorders.

Rule 5: The presence of reactive functional groups or specific moieties known to interact negatively with biological systems increases the potential for side effects. These include unsaturated bonds, aromatic rings with halogen substituents, multiple conjugated double bonds, and certain functional groups like amino acid esters, nitriles, and carboxylic acids.

Rule 6: Molecules with features such as heavy metals, halogenated aromatic rings, long hydrocarbon chains, complex polyether structures, or multiple ring systems are more likely to exhibit adverse effects.

Rule 7: The integration of machine learning models can help in predicting molecular side effects by identifying common structural features among molecules known to cause such effects, further refining their predictive accuracy through iterative training and testing on new molecular data.
