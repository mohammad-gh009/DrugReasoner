Rule 1: Molecules that contain aromatic amino groups in their structure are likely to inhibit human β-secretase 1 (BACE-1).

Rule 2: The presence of aromatic amide groups alongside aromatic amino groups in a molecule increases the likelihood of inhibiting human β-secretase 1 (BACE-1).

Rule 3: Molecules featuring aromatic ethers or sulfonamide groups in conjunction with an aromatic group enhance the potential for inhibiting human β-secretase 1 (BACE-1).

Rule 4: Compounds including a carboxamide group at the C-terminus of a long alkyl chain are less likely to inhibit human β-secretase 1 (BACE-1).

Rule 5: Molecules with bulky hydrophobic groups linked to aromatic amines at the N-terminus are effective inhibitors of human β-secretase 1 (BACE-1).

Rule 6: Functional groups such as aromatic amides or aromatic amines within a molecule's structure, particularly when close to a carboxylic acid group, predict a higher chance of inhibiting human β-secretase 1 (BACE-1).
