Rule 1: Molecules with aromatic amine groups are more likely to inhibit human Î²-secretase 1 (BACE-1).

Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic and/or hydrophobic groups near the amine or within the molecule structure tend to have better BACE-1 inhibition.

Rule 3: The presence of a hydroxy group on the benzene ring or specific aromatic substituents, especially with halogen atoms, is predictive of BACE-1 inhibition.

Rule 4: Having a positively charged amino group on the molecule, along with an aromatic ring, is associated with BACE-1 inhibition.

Rule 5: The presence of bulky groups, such as aromatic rings or long-chain alkyl groups, indicates a potential for BACE-1 inhibition.

Rule 6: Molecules that have a structural motif of "FC1C" groups or similar fluorine-containing cyclic groups at crucial positions (e.g., C-2, C-5, or C-7 of a benzene ring) are indicative of BACE-1 inhibition.

Rule 7: The presence of aromatic and heteroaromatic moieties such as furans, pyridines, or biphenyl groups in the molecule enhances the likelihood of BACE-1 inhibition.

Rule 8: A molecule with aromatic amides and a bulky, hydrophobic group, such as an isopropyl or tert-butyl group attached to the amide nitrogen, potentially increases BACE-1 inhibitory activity.

Rule 9: Aromatic amino acids like Phe, Tyr, or Trp at crucial binding sites of the BACE-1 enzyme significantly contribute to the inhibition efficacy.

Rule 10: Molecules fitting a fused bicyclic structure containing at least one aromatic ring and a secondary amino group significantly predict higher inhibition against human beta-secretase 1.

Rule 11: Molecules with a tertiary amino group in the structure also enhance the inhibitory activity against BACE-1.

Rule 12: The presence of certain halogenated anilines or heteroaromatic groups such as thiophenes increases the molecule's ability to inhibit BACE-1. 

These rules collectively highlight the importance of certain structural features, including aromatic groups, halogen substituents, bulky groups, and hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, in enhancing the likelihood that a molecule can inhibit BACE-1 effectively.
