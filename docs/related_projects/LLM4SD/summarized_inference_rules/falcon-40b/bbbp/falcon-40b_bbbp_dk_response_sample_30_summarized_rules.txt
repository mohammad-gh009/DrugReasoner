Rule 1: The presence of a carboxylic acid group in the molecule increases the likelihood of it being BBBP.
Rule 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule decreases the likelihood of it being BBBP.
Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group in the molecule increases the likelihood of it being BBBP.
Rule 4: Presence of a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) in the molecule is a weak indicator of BBBP activity.
Rule 5: The presence of a benzene ring in the molecule is necessary for it to be BBBP.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a BBBP structure, then it will have a positive charge on one or more nitrogen atoms.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a BBBP structure, it will have at least one carbonyl group and one aromatic ring.
Rule 8: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the molecule, especially when it is part of an aldehyde or ketone functional group, is highly indicative of BBBP activity.
Rule 9: If a molecule has a BBBP structure, then it will not contain the substring "NOT BBBP" in its smile string.
Rule 10: The presence of a bromine atom in the molecule increases the likelihood of it being BBBP.
Rule 11: The presence of a certain number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule is necessary for it to be BBBP.
Rule 12: The presence of a chlorine atom in the molecule, especially when it is attached to a benzene ring, is also highly indicative of BBBP activity.
