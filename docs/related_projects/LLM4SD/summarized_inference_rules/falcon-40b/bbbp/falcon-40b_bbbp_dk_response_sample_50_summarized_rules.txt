Rule 1: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, it increases the likelihood of it being BBBP.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it decreases the likelihood of it being BBBP.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom, it increases the likelihood of it being BBBP. 
Rule 4: BBBP activity is highly linked with the presence of a nitrogen atom, carbonyl group and carboxylic acid group in the molecule.
Rule 5: The presence of a bromine atom in the molecule increases the likelihood of it being BBBP.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom and has a carbonyl group, it is likely to be BBBP.
Rule 7: The presence of a halogen atom in the molecule (ex: chlorine or fluorine) decreases the likelihood of BBBP activity.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a smile string that contains the substring "BBBP", then it will have a positive charge on one or more nitrogen atoms.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a smile string that does not contain the substring "NOT BBBP", it will have a positive charge on one or more nitrogen atoms.
