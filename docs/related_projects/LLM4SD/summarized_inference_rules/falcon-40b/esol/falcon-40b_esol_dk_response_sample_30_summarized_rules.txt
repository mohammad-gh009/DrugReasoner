Rule 1: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) or a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) in a molecule decreases the ESOL value. 
Rule 2: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) increases the ESOL value of a molecule.
Rule 3: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule placed in a heterocyclic ring such as pyridine or pyrrole increases the ESOL value.
Rule 4: The presence of chlorine atom in a molecule increases its ESOL value.
Rule 5: The presence of a sulfur atom in the molecule decreases its ESOL value.
Rule 6: The presence of polar functional groups such as hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, and amine groups enhances the solubility of a molecule in water.
Rule 7: The presence of nonpolar functional groups such as alkyl, alkene, alkyne, aliphatic chains, aromatic rings, or aromatic groups decreases the solubility of a molecule in water.
Rule 8: The presence of halogen atoms such as chlorine, bromine, iodine, or fluorine affects the solubility of a molecule in water, depending on its specific location and other functional groups present.
Rule 9: The number and type of carbon atoms in the molecule, and the positioning of the functional groups can impact the ESOL value.
Rule 10: The solubility of a molecule in water can be affected by the size, shape, surface area, and complexity of the molecule.
Rule 11: The presence of certain functional groups or substituents can affect the molecule's solubility, requiring specific analysis of each molecular structure. 
Rule 12: Factors such as molecular weight, number of hydrogen bonds etc. may also impact the ESOL value of a molecule.
Rule 13: Charged functional groups such as ammonium or sulfonate groups can increase the solubility.
