Rule 1: The presence of polar functional groups such as hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, or amine groups increases the solubility of a molecule in water, which can increase the ESOL value.
 
Rule 2: The presence of nonpolar functional groups such as alkyl or aromatic groups reduces the solubility of a molecule in water, which can decrease the ESOL value.

Rule 3: The size and shape of a molecule can affect its solubility in water. Larger or more complex molecules tend to have lower solubility, and therefore lower ESOL values.

Rule 4: The number of carbon atoms in a molecule significantly impacts its ESOL value. Molecules with more carbon atoms generally have lower ESOL values.

Rule 5: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) decreases a molecule's ESOL value.

Rule 6: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring can increase a molecule's ESOL value.

Rule 7: The presence of a halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine decreases the ESOL value.

Rule 8: The presence of aromatic rings or heteroaromatic rings increases the ESOL value.

Rule 9: The presence of specific functional groups, such as carboxylic acids, amines, and alcohols, can affect the ESOL value of a molecule.

Rule 10: The presence of hydrophilic molecules can lead to a higher ESOL value, while the presence of hydrophobic molecules can lead to a lower ESOL value.

Rule 11: The presence of certain functional groups or substituents, like carbonyl groups, can affect a molecule's solubility and thus its ESOL value.

Rule 12: The presence of polar functional groups located at the ends of a molecule tend to increase solubility and ESOL value more than those located in the middle of the molecule.
Rule 1: The presence of polar functional groups such as hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, or amine groups increases the solubility of a molecule in water.
Rule 2: Molecules with more than one carbon atom tend to be less soluble than those with only one carbon atom.
Rule 3: The presence of certain functional groups such as halogens or aromatic rings can decrease the solubility of a molecule in water.
Rule 4: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) or a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) decreases the ESOL value.
Rule 5: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule increases the ESOL value.
Rule 6: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) on a molecule increases the ESOL value.
Rule 7: The presence of nonpolar functional groups such as alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or aromatic groups decreases solubility of a molecule in water.
Rule 8: The size and shape of a molecule can impact its solubility in water, with larger and more complex molecules being less soluble.
Rule 9: The presence of halogen atoms like chlorine, bromine, or iodine can increase the solubility of a molecule in water.
Rule 10: The presence of oxygen atoms in a molecule can significantly increase its ESOL value.
Rule 11: The presence of charged functional groups such as ammonium or sulfonate groups can increase the solubility of a molecule in water.
