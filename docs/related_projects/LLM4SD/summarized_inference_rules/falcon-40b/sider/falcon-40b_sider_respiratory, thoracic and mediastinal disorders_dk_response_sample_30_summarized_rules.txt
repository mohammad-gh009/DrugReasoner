Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom in its structure, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule has a Fe atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule has a [18F] atom, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a COCCOC(=O)NCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)NCCCCCCCOP(=O)(C)O)NC(=O)OCCOC group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it decreases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 12: Molecules with a high number of oxygen atoms or nitrogen atoms in their structure are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: Molecules with a high number of carbon atoms in their structure are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: Molecules with a high number of chlorine atoms in their structure are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: Molecules with a positive label are more likely to contain nitrogen atoms in their structure.
Rule 16: Molecules with a positive label are more likely to contain multiple carbon-carbon double bonds in their structure.
Rule 17: Molecules with a positive label are more likely to contain sulfur atoms in their structure.
Rule 18: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 19: Molecules with a positive label (i.e., 1), are more likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 20: If a molecule has a certain functional group or structure, such as a sulfonamide or a benzene ring, then it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 21: If a molecule has a certain number of atoms or bonds, such as a high degree of branching or a large number of double bonds, then it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 22: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 23: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom in a heterocyclic ring, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
