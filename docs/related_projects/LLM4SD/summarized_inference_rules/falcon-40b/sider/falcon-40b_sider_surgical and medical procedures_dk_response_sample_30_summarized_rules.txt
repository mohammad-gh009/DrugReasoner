Rule 1: Molecules containing a carboxylic acid group are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a nitrogen atom in their structure are more likely to cause adverse effects, especially if the nitrogen is part of an amine, amide group or a heterocyclic ring. 
Rule 3: Molecules with a high number of carbon atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: Molecules containing a positive charge are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: Molecules containing a negative charge are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: Molecules containing a metal ion are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: Molecules containing a sulfonamide group are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: Molecules containing a halogen atom are likely to cause adverse effects. However, the presence of a chlorine atom in its structure, decreases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 9: Molecules with a high number of chlorine atoms, fluorine atoms or halogen atoms (such as chlorine or bromine) in general increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 10: Molecules with a high number of nitrogen atoms or nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring in their structure are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: Molecules containing a nitro group or a sulfonyl group are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: If a molecule has a positive charge or a negative charge, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: The presence of a carbonyl group (e.g., C=O) in the molecule, especially if it is conjugated with another functional group, increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 14: Molecules with a long chain of carbon atoms are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: Molecules containing a sulfur atom in their structure are more likely to cause adverse effects, especially if the sulfur is part of a sulfonamide or sulfone group.
Rule 16: Molecules containing a sulfonate group are more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 17: Molecules containing a carboxylic acid group or its derivatives (e.g., esters, amides) increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 18: Presence of a nitrogen atom that is part of certain configuration (such as a pyridine ring) is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 19: Presence of a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine) in the molecule, especially if it is attached to a carbon atom, increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
