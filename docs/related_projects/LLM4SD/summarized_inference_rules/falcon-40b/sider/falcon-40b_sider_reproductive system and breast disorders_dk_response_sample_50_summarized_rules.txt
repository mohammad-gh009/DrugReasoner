Rule 1: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) usually have a higher probability of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond donors (HBD) generally have a lower probability of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with a high number of rotatable bonds often have a higher probability of causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: Presence of nitrogen atoms in a molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: Presence of carbonyl groups in a molecule also increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule usually decreases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 7: Presence of chlorine atoms in a molecule usually lowers the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 8: Presence of sulfur atoms in a molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 9: Presence of a carboxylic acid group in a molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 10: Presence of a sulfonamide group in a molecule decreases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 11: Presence of halogen atoms in a molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 12: Presence of a nitro group in a molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 13: Presence of a platinum group metal atom in a molecule indicates that it may cause reproductive system and breast disorders.
Rule 14: Presence of a long chain of carbon atoms in a molecule typically decreases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 15: If the molecule contains a positive charge, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: If the molecule contains a negative charge, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: If the molecule contains a large number of carbon atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 18: A molecule with a high number of aromatic rings or heteroatoms is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 19: A molecule containing a positive charge on the molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects while a negative charge decreases it.
Rule 20: Presence of features like sulfonamide or halogen atoms, increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 21: Presence of a carboxylic acid group, nitrogen atom, or halogen atom in a certain position increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 22: Presence of a Zn atom in a molecule or side-effect activity related to reproductive system and breast disorders increase the likelihood of it causing adverse effects. 
Rule 23: Molecules containing sulfur atoms tend to have more complex structures and are more likely to interact with biological systems leading to adverse effects.
Rule 24: The presence of a carboxylic acid group or its derivatives in the molecule often leads to adverse effects.
Rule 25: Nitrogen atoms being part of a heterocyclic ring in a molecule often increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
