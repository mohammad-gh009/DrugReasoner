Rule 1: The presence of a carboxylic acid group in a molecule is associated with an increased likelihood of hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule is associated with hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 3: The presence of a halogen atom in a molecule is associated with an increased likelihood of hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 4: The presence of a sulfur atom in a molecule decreases the likelihood of hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it is less likely to cause hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 6: If a molecule has a high number of carbon atoms and a low number of hydrogen atoms, it increases the likelihood of hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 7: If a molecule has a long side chain, it is less likely to cause hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 8: A molecule containing a nitrogen atom in its structure increases its hepatotoxicity potential.
Rule 9: A molecule containing a chlorine atom in its structure decreases its hepatotoxicity potential.
Rule 10: The presence of a sulfur atom in a molecule has no significant impact on its hepatotoxicity potential.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group in its structure, it is more likely to cause hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 12: If a molecule has a high number of nitrogen atoms, it is more likely to cause hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 13: If a molecule has a high number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: If a molecule contains a large number of aromatic rings, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: If a molecule has a high number of polar atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: If a molecule has a high number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: If a molecule has a high number of rotatable bonds, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 18: If a molecule has a high number of aromatic rings, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 19: If a molecule has a long aliphatic chain and a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 20: If a molecule has a long chain of carbon atoms, it is less likely to cause hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 21: If a molecule contains a nitro group, it is more likely to cause hepatobiliary disorders.
