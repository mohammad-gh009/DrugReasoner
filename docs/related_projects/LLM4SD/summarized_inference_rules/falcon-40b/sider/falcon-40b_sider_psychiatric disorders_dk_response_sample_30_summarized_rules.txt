Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, it is frequently associated with an increased likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom in its structure, multiple accounts suggest it can cause adverse effects, while a few suggest a decreased likelihood.

Rule 3: Having a chlorine atom in the molecule was considered to both increase and decrease the likelihood of causing adverse effects, varying with differing data. 

Rule 4: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors are more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 5: Molecules with prevalent presence of aromatic rings or nitrogen atoms can cause more adverse effects.

Rule 6: Molecules with a high number of polar groups or charged functional groups often cause adverse effects.

Rule 7: Molecules with a high number of nitrogen atoms or nitrogen-containing functional groups increase the chance of adverse effects.

Rule 8: Molecules having high counts of aromatic rings or aromatic functional groups often result in adverse effects.

Rule 9: Molecules with a high number of halogen atoms or halogen-containing functional groups typically increase the risk of adverse effects.

Rule 10: If a molecule has a long chain of carbon atoms, it generally lessens the likelihood to cause adverse effects.

Rule 11: The presence of a carbonyl group in the molecule can lead to adverse effects.

Rule 12: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom, it typically increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 13: The presence of a carboxylic acid group in the molecule is linked to an increased likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 14: If a molecule has a high number of carbon atoms and a low number of hydrogen atoms, it generally increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 15: The presence of a metal ion in the molecule often increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 16: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom and has a positive charge, it typically increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 17: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom and has a negative charge, it generally lessens the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 18: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom and has a negative charge, it often decreases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 19: Molecules with a high number of nitrogen atoms and a low number of carbon atoms typically cause more adverse effects.

Rule 20: Molecules with a high number of oxygen atoms and a low number of carbon atoms generally lead to more adverse effects.

Rule 21: Molecules with a high number of sulfur atoms and a low number of carbon atoms potentially cause more adverse effects.

Rule 22: If a molecule contains a bromine atom in its structure, it typically leads to more adverse effects.

Rule 23: The presence of a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) in the molecule often increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 24: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom, especially if it is part of an amine or amide group, it typically escalates the likelihood of adverse effects.

Rule 25: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom, particularly if it is part of a sulfonamide or sulfone group, it usually escalates the likelihood of adverse effects.

Rule 26: Molecules with a high number of aromatic rings or heterocyclic rings are linked to more side effects.

Rule 27: Molecules with a high number of nitrogen atoms or amines are frequently linked to more side effects.

Rule 28: Molecules with a high number of halogens or sulfur atoms are often linked to more side effects.
