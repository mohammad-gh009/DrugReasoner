Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause gastrointestinal disorders.

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom in its structure, it is less likely to cause gastrointestinal disorders.

Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause gastrointestinal disorders.

Rule 4: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group in its structure, it is more likely to cause gastrointestinal disorders.

Rule 5: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group in its structure, it is more likely to cause gastrointestinal disorders.

Rule 6: If a molecule has a long chain of carbon atoms, it is less likely to cause gastrointestinal disorders. 

Rule 7: If a molecule has a chlorine atom in its structure and a long chain of carbon atoms, it is more likely to cause gastrointestinal disorders.

Rule 8: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it decreases the likelihood of causing gastrointestinal disorders.

Rule 9: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom in its structure and a nitrogen atom, it less likely to cause gastrointestinal disorders.

Rule 10: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure and a positive charge, it is more likely to cause gastrointestinal disorders.

Rule 11: A chlorine atom in the molecule along with a negative charge is likely to cause gastrointestinal disorders.

Rule 12: Should a molecule contain a sulfur atom in its structure and a negative charge, it is likely to cause gastrointestinal disorders.

Rule 13: The presence of a metal ion in the molecule is associated with gastrointestinal disorders.

Rule 14: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure and has a long chain of carbon atoms, it is more likely to cause gastrointestinal disorders.

Rule 15: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure also has a high number of carbon atoms and a low number of hydrogen atoms, it is more likely to cause gastrointestinal disorders.

Rule 16: If a molecule contains a metal ion such as sodium or magnesium, it is more likely to cause gastrointestinal disorders.

Rule 17: Should a molecule contain a fluorine atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects. 

Rule 18: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom and has a long chain of carbon atoms, it is more likely to cause gastrointestinal disorders. 

Rule 19: If a molecule contains a nitro group, it is more likely to cause gastrointestinal disorders.
