Rule 1: A molecule is more likely to cause adverse effects if it contains a nitrogen atom and a positive charge.

Rule 2: A molecule is more likely to cause adverse effects if it contains a chlorine atom and has a negative charge.

Rule 3: A molecule is more likely to cause adverse effects if it contains a sulfur atom and has a negative charge.

Rule 4: The presence of a carboxylic acid group in a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 5: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule decreases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 6: The presence of a halogen atom in a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 7: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 8: If a molecule contains certain functional groups or chemical structures known to be associated with side effects, such as amines, sulfonamides, or carboxylic acids, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 9: If a molecule has a high molecular weight or low water solubility, it is more likely to accumulate in the body and cause side effects.

Rule 10: If a molecule has poor ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) properties, such as low bioavailability or rapid clearance, it is more likely to have limited therapeutic effects and cause side effects.

Rule 11: If a molecule contains a long chain of carbon atoms, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 12: The presence of a carbonyl group in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 13: The presence of a carboxylic acid group in the molecule decreases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 14: If a molecule has a positive charge on any atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 15: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors are more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 16: Molecules with a high number of aromatic rings are more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 17: Molecules with a high number of polar groups are more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 18: If a molecule contains a platinum atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 19: The presence of a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 20: The presence of a sulfonamide group in the molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
