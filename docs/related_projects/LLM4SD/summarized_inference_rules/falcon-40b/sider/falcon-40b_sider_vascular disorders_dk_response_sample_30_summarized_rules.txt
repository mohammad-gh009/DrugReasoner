Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, it can either increase or decrease the likelihood to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of a halogen atom (like chlorine, bromine or fluorine) in a molecule tends to increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom in its structure, it most often increases the likelihood to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: The presence of a carbonyl group in a molecule is associated with an increased likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a molecule more likely causes adverse effects. 
Rule 7: If a molecule contains certain metal atoms (e.g., Platinum, Thallium) in its structure, they can increase the cause of adverse effects.
Rule 8: Molecules containing nitrogen atoms in specific configurations (part of a heterocyclic ring or a quaternary ammonium group), or sulfur atoms in specific configurations (part of a thiol group or a disulfide bond), are likelier to cause adverse effects.
