Rule 1: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
 
Rule 2: The presence of a sulfur atom in a molecule decreases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 3: The presence of chlorine atom in a molecule decreases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 4: The presence of specific groups like a carbonyl group or a sulfonamide group in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 5: If a molecule contains a long chain of carbon atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 6: The presence of a metal ion in a molecule significantly increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.

Rule 7: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 8: Halogen atoms (e.g., Cl, Br) in the molecule increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 9: Nitrogen atoms, especially when part of a heterocyclic ring, increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 10: Certain functional groups, such as carboxylic acids or amines, increase the possibility of adverse effects.

Rule 11: Presence of specific functional groups, number of rings, or other certain structural features can indicate the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 12: A high number of rotatable bonds in a molecule tend to increase the probability of causing adverse effects.

Rule 13: A molecule with a high number of hydrogen bond acceptors tends to have a higher probability of causing adverse effects.

Rule 14: Molecules with a high number of aromatic rings tend to decrease the probability of causing adverse effects.

Rule 15: Certain metal ions (e.g., Fe) in the molecule indicate a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 16: High number of carbon atoms in a molecule can suggest a higher probability of adverse effects.

Rule 17: The presence of positive or negative charge on the molecule can indicate potential adverse effects.

Rule 18: Molecules with certain structural features, e.g., the presence of certain functional groups such as amines, sulfonamides, and carboxylic acids, as well as specific ring systems such as benzene rings or heterocyclic rings are more likely to cause adverse reactions.
