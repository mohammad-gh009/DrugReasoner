Rule 19: The presence of chlorine and negative charge in a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 20: The presence of sulfur and positive charge in a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects. 

Rule 21: The presence of a halogen atom (e.g., F, Cl, Br) in the structure of a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 22: The presence of nitrogen-containing functional groups (e.g., amine, imine, nitrile) may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 23: The presence of heavy metal ions (e.g., Gd+) or reactive oxygen species (ROS) may increase the likelihood of adverse effects.

Rule 27: The presence of sulfur atoms in the structure of a molecule, especially if they are part of a heterocyclic ring (e.g., thiophene, furan), it is likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 28: Molecules with a high number of nitrogen atoms and a low number of carbon atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 29: Molecules with a high number of chlorine atoms and a low number of oxygen atoms are likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 30: Molecules with a high number of sulfur atoms and a low number of oxygen atoms are likely to cause adverse effects. 

Rule 31: If a molecule has nitrogen atom and a positive charge, it is more likely to cause adverse effects. 

Rule 32: If a molecule has chlorine atom and a negative charge, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 33: If a molecule has sulfur atom and a positive charge, it is more likely to cause adverse effects. 

Rule 34: The presence of certain functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, amines, sulfonamides) in the structure of a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.

The rules are not foolproof and there may be exceptions. Other factors such as dosage, individual susceptibility, environmental conditions, and interactions with other drugs or substances should also be considered.
