Rule 1: Molecules containing nitrogen atoms are typically more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing chlorine atoms are generally less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with a carbonyl group are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: Molecules containing sulfur atoms are generally more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom and has a positive charge, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group and has a negative charge, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: The presence of a fluorine atom increases the likelihood of a molecule causing adverse effects.
Rule 8: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors, or that have many aromatic rings or nitrogen atoms, are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: Molecules with a high number of rotatable bonds are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: Molecules containing a carboxylic acid group are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: Molecules containing a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: Molecules containing halogen atoms are more likely to have adverse effects.
Rule 13: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a molecule's structure is associated with endocrine disorders and may indicate potential side effects.
Rule 14: Molecules that contain a sulfur atom and have a negative charge are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom and has a positive charge, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 21: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 22: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 23: Molecules that contain sulfur atoms and have a negative charge are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 24: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing endocrine disorders.
Rule 25: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule, especially if it is attached to a carbonyl group, increases the likelihood of causing endocrine disorders.
Rule 26: The presence of a sulfur atom in a molecule, especially if it is attached to a carbonyl group, decreases the likelihood of causing endocrine disorders.
Rule 27: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 28: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (COOH), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 29: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
