Rule 1: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the structure of a molecule enhances the probability of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of a chlorine atom in the structure of a molecule reduces the probability of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of a sulfur atom in the molecule increases the probability of causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) are more likely to cause adverse effects as molecules with a higher HBA count often have higher toxicity.
Rule 5: Molecules with a high number of rotatable bonds (RBs) are more likely to cause adverse effects as molecules with a higher RB count often have higher toxicity.
Rule 6: Molecules with a high number of aromatic rings are more likely to cause adverse effects as molecules with a higher aromatic ring count often have higher toxicity.
Rule 7: The inclusion of a carboxylic acid group in the molecule increases the chances of causing adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule includes a halogen atom, it is more likely to be harmful.
Rule 9: The presence of a positive charge on the molecule can increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 10: Certain functional groups or motifs in the molecule increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 11: The presence of a metal ion in the molecule can augment its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 12: The inclusion of certain structural features in a molecule, such as a long alkyl chain or a large number of rings, can increase its likelihood of causing harmful effects.
Rule 13: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: When a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group or its derivatives, the likelihood of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders increases.
Rule 15: The presence of a sulfonamide group or its derivatives in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 16: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom, especially if it is part of an amine or amide group, it increases the likelihood of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 17: When the molecule has a high number of hydrogen bonds between its atoms, it's more likely to cause skin irritation or allergic reactions.
Rule 18: With a high degree of branching or complexity in their structure, molecules are more likely to cause skin irritation or allergic reactions.
Rule 19: The presence of a carboxylic acid group or its derivatives (e.g., esters, amides) in the molecule increases the likelihood of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 20: The inclusion of a negative charge on the molecule decreases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 21: When the molecule includes certain functional groups, such as sulfonates, carboxylates, and amines, the likelihood of causing adverse effects increases.
Rule 22: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors are more likely to cause adverse effects due to their tendency to interact strongly with proteins and other biological molecules.
Rule 23: Molecules with a high number of polar functional groups or charged atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects as they can disrupt normal biological function.
Rule 24: Molecules with a high number of aromatic rings or conjugated systems are more likely to cause adverse effects as they are more reactive.
Rule 25: The presence of a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) in the molecule can increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 26: Nitrogen atoms' presence, especially if they are part of a heterocyclic ring or a nitro group, can accelerate the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 27: The presence of sulfur atoms, especially if part of a sulfonamide or sulfone group, can increase the probability of causing adverse effects.
Rule 28: The inclusion of a metal ion (e.g., 99Tc) in the molecule reduces the likelihood of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
