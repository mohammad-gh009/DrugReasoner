Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule has a long chain of carbon atoms, it may likely cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom in its structure, predictions can vary: some cases suggest it is less likely to cause adverse effects, while others suggest it is more likely.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group attached to a nitrogen atom, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If the molecule contains a halogen atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a "CN" group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a "C(=O)" group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a "C(=O)O" group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: If the molecule has a positive charge, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule, especially if it is part of an amine or amide group, increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 14: The presence of a halogen atom in the molecule, especially if it is attached to a carbon atom, increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 15: If a molecule has a high number of chlorine atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom in its structure, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: If the molecule contains a positive charge, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 18: If the molecule contains a polar functional group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 19: If a molecule has a high number of carbon atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 20: The presence of a sulfur atom in the molecule decreases the likelihood of adverse effects.
Rule 21: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group or a sulfonamide group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 22: If the molecule contains a magnesium ion, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
