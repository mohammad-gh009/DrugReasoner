Rule 1: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule has been presented with conflict; in some occasions, it increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects, and in others, it decreases it.
Rule 2: The presence of a carbonyl group in the molecule mostly increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid group in a molecule generally results in higher chances of causing adverse effects, although there are rare occurrences indicating the opposite.
Rule 4: The presence of a halogen atom in a molecule creates mixed implications; some suggest that it increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects, others say it decreases this likelihood.
Rule 5: The presence of a platinum atom in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of a sulfur atom in a molecule gives conflicting rules, with most suggesting it increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects, but a few suggesting the opposite.
Rule 7: The presence of certain functional groups (such as amines, sulfonamides, or carboxylic acids), or complex structures with multiple functional groups often increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 8: A positive charge on the molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects, whereas a negative charge decreases this likelihood.
Rule 9: The presence of a high number of carbon atoms or rotatable bonds within a molecule generally increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 10: The presence of a metal ion such as sodium or iodine in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
