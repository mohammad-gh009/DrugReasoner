Rule 14: Molecules that contain a positive or negative charge are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: Molecules that contain a polar functional group, such as OH, COOH, NH2, are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: Molecules that contain a large number of rotatable bonds are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: Molecules containing a halogen atom like Cl, Br, I are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 18: The presence of a positive charge on the molecule, especially in the form of NH3+ or COO-, increases the likelihood of adverse effects.
Rule 19: Molecules with a positive label are more likely to contain nitrogen atoms, carbonyl groups, and halogen atoms in their structure, thus more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 24: Molecules that contain a sulfur atom and have a nitrogen atom attached to it are likely to cause an adverse effect.
Rule 25: Molecules that contain a nitrogen atom and have a carbonyl group attached to it are likely to cause an adverse effect.
Rule 26: Molecules that contain a high number of polar groups are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 27: Molecules that contain a high number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 28: The presence of a nitrogen atom attached to a carbonyl group or heterocyclic ring increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 29: The presence of a sulfur atom attached to a carbonyl group or a heterocyclic ring increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects. 
Rule 30: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 31: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group or a sulfonamide group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 32: If a molecule contains a halogen atom and has a positive charge, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 33: Molecules containing a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 34: The presence of halogen atoms (e.g., Cl, Br, I) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 35: The presence of nitrogen atoms in a molecule, especially if they are part of a heterocyclic ring or a nitro group, increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 36: The presence of sulfur atoms in a molecule, especially if they are part of a sulfonamide or sulfone group, increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
