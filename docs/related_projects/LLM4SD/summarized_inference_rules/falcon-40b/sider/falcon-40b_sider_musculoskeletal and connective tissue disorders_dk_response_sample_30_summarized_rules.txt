Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of a sulfur atom in a molecule tends to decrease its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with a chlorine atom in their structure are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: Molecules containing a carbonyl group have a higher tendency of causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it is more inclined to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: When a molecule has a long chain of carbon atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: Molecules containing a metal ion are more likely to have adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: Molecules containing a halogen atom have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 10: The presence of certain functional groups, such as carboxylic acids or amines, in a molecule can increase their chance of causing adverse effects.
Rule 11: Molecules with a high number of rotatable bonds, hydrogen bond acceptors or with many aromatic rings have a higher probability of causing adverse effects.
Rule 12: The presence of a benzene ring in a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a high number of carbon atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: The presence of a Fe ion in a molecule indicates that it may cause adverse effects.
