Rule 1: A molecule containing a carboxylic acid group is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a metal ion such as zinc or potassium are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of a chlorine atom in a molecule is likely to decrease the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: Molecules containing a sulfur atom are more likely to cause adverse effects unless bonded to a nitrogen atom.
Rule 6: If a nitrogen atom in a molecule is bonded to a carbonyl group or a carboxylic acid group, it increases the likelihood of the molecule to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 7: A high number of hydrogen bonds in a molecule increases its likelihood to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: A molecule with a long chain of carbon atoms is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a molecule increases the risk of causing adverse effects.
Rule 10: The presence of halogen atoms (such as chlorine or fluorine) in a molecule increases the risk of causing adverse effects.
Rule 11: Molecules containing a Zn+2, Ba+2, or Na+ ion are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: The presence of a carboxylic acid group, a sulfonamide group or a nitrogen atom in a molecule is associated with blood and lymphatic system disorders.
Rule 13: Molecules with a high number of chlorine atoms, fluorine atoms, nitrogen atoms or oxygen atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: Nitrogen atoms in specific configurations (e.g., N=N, N-N=N, N+N=N) in a molecule increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 15: A high number of hydrogen atoms in a molecule likely decreases its potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: The presence of a sodium ion in a molecule increases its likelihood to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: Molecules having a high number of Smiles strings labeled as 1 are more likely to cause adverse effects, while those with a high number of Smiles strings labeled as 0 are less likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 18: The presence of a certain type of functional group or structure, such as a sulfonamide or a carboxylic acid in a molecule, is associated with an increased likelihood of causing adverse effects.
