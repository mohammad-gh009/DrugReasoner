Rule 1: Molecules containing a nitrogen atom are typically more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing chlorine atoms are often less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules that contain sulfur atoms are generally more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine, it increases its chances of causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: If the nitrogen atoms in a molecule are part of a heterocyclic ring, it increases the probability of causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: If sulfur atoms in a molecule are part of a heterocyclic ring, this increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 7: The presence of a carboxylic acid group in a molecule increases its potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a halogen atom in a molecule is attached to a carbon atom, it increases its potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 9: Molecules with a high number of carbon atoms and a low number of hydrogen atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule has a long chain of carbon atoms, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: Molecules with a high number of nitrogen atoms and/or a high number of chlorine atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: Molecules with a high number of carbon atoms and/or a high number of oxygen atoms are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: Molecules with a high number of sulfur atoms and/or a high number of fluorine atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: If a molecule contains a side-chain with a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: If a molecule contains a side-chain with a sulfonamide group, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: If a molecule contains a side-chain with a nitrogen atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: The presence of a high number of rotatable bonds in a molecule often increases the likelyhood of adverse effects.
Rule 18: If a molecule contains certain functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, amines, sulfonamides) it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 19: If a molecule carries a positive charge it increases the molecule's likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 20: If a molecule carries a negative charge it often decreases the molecule's likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 21: The presence of multiple aromatic rings in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 22: The presence or high number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors in a molecule can impact its potential toxicity.
Rule 23: The presence of certain functional groups such as amines, sulfonamides, and nitro groups can increase the likelihood of toxicity.
Rule 24: The molecular weight and lipophilicity of a molecule can affect its toxicity. Molecules with high MW and low logP values tend to have higher toxicity.
Rule 25: The presence of a carbonyl group in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 26: A high number of aromatic rings or heterocyclic rings in a molecule points towards a higher probability of causing adverse effects.
Rule 27: A high number of polar functional groups in a molecule indicates higher probability of causing adverse effects.
Rule 28: The presence of multiple carbonyl groups in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 29: The presence of a positive charge on the molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects. 
Rule 30: The presence of a negative charge on the molecule decreases its likelihood of causing adverse effects. 
Rule 31: If a molecule has a nitrogen atom and a positive charge, it is likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 32: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom and a negative charge, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 33: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom and a positive charge, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 34: If a molecule contains a negative charge or a sulfur atom, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
