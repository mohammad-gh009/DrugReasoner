Rule 1: Molecules that contain a carboxylic acid group are more likely to have adverse effects.
Rule 2: An increase in the occurrence of nitrogen atoms in the structure of a molecule correlates with an increased likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a metal ion like zinc or potassium are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of chlorine atoms in the molecular structure usually decreases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: When sulfur atoms are part of the molecule, the probability of causing adverse effects rises.
Rule 6: The presence of nitrogen atoms bonded to a carbonyl group or a carboxylic acid group increases the likelihood of the molecule having adverse effects.
Rule 7: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bonds are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: Molecules that contain a long chain of carbon atoms are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: Molecules containing Zn+2, Ba+2, or Na+ ions are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: Molecules containing specific functional groups or structures, like sulfonamides or carboxylic acid, have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 11: Molecules having a high number of Smiles strings labeled as 1 are likely to cause adverse effects, whereas those with a high number of Smiles strings labeled as 0 are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 13: The presence of a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) in a molecule also increases the chances of adverse effects. 
Rule 14: Molecules with high numbers of chlorine atoms, fluorine atoms, nitrogen atoms, or oxygen atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: Molecules containing specific nitrogen configurations (e.g., N=N, N-N=N, N+N=N) are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: Molecules with high numbers of positive charges are likely to have adverse effects.
Rule 17: The presence of specific ions such as sodium or iron may increase the likelihood of a molecule causing adverse effects.
Rule 18: Molecules containing Fe, Cl, or Br atoms are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 19: If a molecule has a positive label (i.e., 1), it is likely to cause adverse effects. If it has a negative label (i.e., 0), it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
