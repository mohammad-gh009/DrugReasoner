Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or fluorine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a high number of carbon atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: The presence of a carboxylic acid group or its derivatives in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 11: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule, especially if it is part of a heterocyclic ring, increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 12: The presence of a sulfur atom in the molecule, especially if it is part of a thiol group, increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 13: Molecules containing sulfonamide groups or nitrogen-containing heterocyclic rings are more likely to cause renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 14: Molecules containing carboxylic acid groups or amide bonds are less likely to cause renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 15: Molecules containing aromatic rings or aliphatic chains are less likely to cause renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 16: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom in its structure, it is less likely to cause renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 17: If the molecule contains a sodium ion, it is more likely to cause renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 18: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, it is more likely to cause renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 19: If a molecule has a positive charge on the nitrogen atom (N+), it is more likely to cause renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 20: If a molecule has a negative charge on the nitrogen atom (N-), it is less likely to cause renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 21: If a molecule has a positive charge on the oxygen atom (O+), it is more likely to cause renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 22: If a molecule has a negative charge on the oxygen atom (O-), it is less likely to cause renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 23: If a molecule has a positive charge on the sulfur atom (S+), it is more likely to cause renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 24: If a molecule has a negative charge on the sulfur atom (S-), it is less likely to cause renal and urinary disorders.
