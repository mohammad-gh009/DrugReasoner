Rule 1: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of a sulfur atom in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group or a sulfonic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a metal ion or a metal complex, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: Molecules with a high number of aromatic rings or heterocyclic rings are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: Molecules with a high number of polar functional groups or charged atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) or its derivatives (-COO-, -COOH, etc.) in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 12: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule, especially if it is part of an amine or amide group, increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects. 
Rule 13: The presence of a sulfur atom in the molecule, especially if it is part of a sulfonamide or sulfonate group, increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 14: The presence of multiple functional groups in a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects. Large, complex molecules with many functional groups are more likely to have adverse effects than smaller, simpler molecules.
Rule 15: The presence of a chlorine atom in the molecule decreases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 16: If the molecule has a high number of carbon atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 17: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
