Rule 1: Molecules containing a carboxylic acid group are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a sulfonamide group are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules that contain a halogen atom are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: The presence of a chlorine atom in a molecule decreases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of a sulfur atom in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 7: Molecules containing a positive charge are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: Molecules containing a negative charge are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: Molecules that contain large numbers of hydrogen bonds are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: The presence of functional groups, such as amines or sulfonates, increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 11: The presence of a fluorine atom in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 12: A high number of carbon atoms and a low number of hydrogen atoms in a molecule increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 13: Molecules with a long chain of carbon atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: The presence of a benzene ring in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 15: The presence of a platinum atom in a molecule decreases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 16: If a molecule contains a nitro group or a nitroso group, it's more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: The presence of a metal ion (e.g., Zn, Fe, Cu) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 18: The presence of a positive or negative charge on a molecule may indicate potential toxicity.
Rule 19: The presence of heavy metals such as silver or platinum may increase the likelihood of toxicity.
Rule 20: A molecule containing a carbonyl group and a negative charge is likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 21: A molecule containing a sulfur atom and a positive charge is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 22: The presence of certain functional groups or structural features in the molecule (e.g., amines, sulfonamides, quinones, etc.) increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 23: Number of functional groups in the molecule greater than or equal to 10, the complexity of the structure as measured by the number of atoms, and the presence of certain functional groups, such as halogens or nitrogen heterocycles, indicate a higher likelihood of side-effect activity.
