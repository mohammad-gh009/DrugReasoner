Rule 1: The presence of halogen atoms (e.g., fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine) in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of nitrogen atoms in the molecule, especially if they are part of a heterocyclic ring, amine, or amide group, or if the nitrogen atom is bonded to two or more carbon atoms, increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects. 
Rule 3: The presence of sulfur atoms in the molecule, especially if they are part of a sulfonamide or sulfone group, or if the sulfur atom is bonded to two or more carbon atoms, increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a CCN(C)C group, then it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a Fe atom with an O atom attached to it, then it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a positive charge on nitrogen or oxygen atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: Molecules with a high number of oxygen atoms in their structure are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule has a high number of carbon atoms, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule has a long chain of carbon atoms, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: If a molecule contains a sulfonate group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom that is part of an amine group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom that is part of a sulfide group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: If the molecule contains a high number of chlorine atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 17: If the nitrogen atom is in a certain position, it is more likely to cause adverse effects than if it does not.
Rule 18: The presence of a carbonyl group in the molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 19: Molecules with a high number of nitrogen atoms in their structure are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 20: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, it is less likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 21: If the molecule has a long chain of carbon atoms, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 22: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom in its structure, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 23: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 24: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
