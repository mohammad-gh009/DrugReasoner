Rule 1: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule's structure tends to increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: A molecule that contains a long chain of carbon atoms is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of a sulfur atom in a molecule's structure can both increase and decrease its likelihood of causing adverse effects depending on other factors.
Rule 4: The presence of a carboxylic acid group in a molecule increases the probability of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: The presence of a halogen atom in a molecule tends to increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: A molecule with a chlorine atom in its structure is more likely to reduce its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 7: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a molecule structure increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 8: A molecule with a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in its structure increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 9: Molecules with a high number of rotatable bonds and low number of hydrogen bond donors have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 10: Molecules with a high number of aromatic rings, nitrogen atoms, carbonyl groups or oxygen atoms increase their likelihood to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: The presence of certain functional groups like carboxylic acid group (-COOH) or sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing cardiac disorders.
Rule 12: The presence of a nitrogen atom attached to a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule may also increase its likelihood of causing cardiac disorders.
Rule 13: Halogen atoms (such as chlorine or bromine) in a molecule increase its likelihood of causing cardiac disorders.
Rule 14: Molecules with a high number of nitrogen atoms, carbon atoms, aromatic rings or heteroaromatic rings are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: Molecules with a high number of oxygen atoms or fluorine atoms are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: A molecule containing a high number of aromatic functional groups or halogens is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, polar functional groups such as carboxylic acids, amines, and esters, or a high number of aromatic or heterocyclic rings are more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 18: Molecules with a high degree of branching and complexity are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 19: Molecules with a positive charge are more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 20: The presence of a fluorine atom in the structure of a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
