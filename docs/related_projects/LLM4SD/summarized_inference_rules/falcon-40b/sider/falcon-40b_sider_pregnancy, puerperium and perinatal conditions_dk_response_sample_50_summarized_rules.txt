Rule 17: Molecules with a high number of aromatic rings and/or heteroatoms (such as nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur) are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 18: Molecules with long, flexible chains or branches are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 19: Molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 20: Molecules containing a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring, such as pyridine, pyrrole, or imidazole, are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 21: Molecules with a high number of carbon atoms in their structure are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 22: Molecules that contain a benzene ring or a phenyl group are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 23: Molecules with a high number of oxygen atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 24: Molecules with a high number of nitrogen atoms in their structure are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 25: Molecules with a high number of carbon atoms in their structure are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 26: Molecules with a high number of oxygen atoms in their structure are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 27: Molecules with a hydrogen bond donors and acceptors and low molecular weight are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 28: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (C=O) are more likely to cause adverse effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions.
Rule 29: Molecules containing a sulfonamide group (SO2NH2) are more likely to cause adverse effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions.
Rule 30: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom in a specific position, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: Molecules with a high number of aromatic rings and/or heteroatoms (like nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur) are more likely to cause adverse effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions.
Rule 2: Molecules with a high number of polar functional groups (such as carboxylic acids, amines, or esters) are also more likely to cause adverse effects in these same situations.
Rule 3: The risk of adverse effects similarly increases in molecules with a high number of chiral centers or stereogenic atoms.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects, regardless of the condition.
Rule 5: Conversely, a molecule with a halogen atom is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a platinum atom, it has a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions.
Rule 7: The same increase in risk is true for molecules containing a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring or a sulfonamide group.
Rule 8: Molecules with a high number of rings and/or double bonds, specific functional groups like amines, sulfonamides, or carboxylic acids or those containing heavy metals or other toxic elements are all more likely to cause adverse effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions.
Rule 9: Molecules with a positive label are more likely to cause adverse effects during these conditions, whilst those with a negative label are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: Molecules with a positive label that contain a carboxylic acid group or a carboxylic acid group and a nitrogen atom are more likely to cause adverse effects than molecules with a positive label that do not contain these properties.
Rule 11: The presence of a nitro group in a molecule increases its potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 12: The presence of a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) or a metal ion (like iron or zinc) in a molecule may also increase its potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 13: Molecules with a high number of aromatic rings or heterocyclic rings, polar functional groups, and halogen atoms, especially fluorine, chlorine, and bromine, are more likely to cause adverse effects in pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions.
