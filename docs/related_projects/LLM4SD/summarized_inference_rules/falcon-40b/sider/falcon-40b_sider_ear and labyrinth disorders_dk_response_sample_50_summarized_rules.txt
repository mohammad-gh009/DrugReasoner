Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom in its structure, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: The presence of a carboxylic acid group or its derivatives in the structure of a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (e.g., Cl-, Br-, I-) in the structure of a molecule, it increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule has a high number of rotatable bonds, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a bromine atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: If a molecule contains a platinum atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a Fe ion, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: If a molecule contains a K ion, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: If a molecule contains a P ion, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
