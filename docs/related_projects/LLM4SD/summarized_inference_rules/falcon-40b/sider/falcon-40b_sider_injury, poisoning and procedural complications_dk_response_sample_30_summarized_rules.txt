Rule 1: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule generally increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of a carbonyl group in the molecule generally increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of halogen atoms (specifically fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine), particularly if attached to a carbon atom or are part of a heterocyclic ring, tends to increase the molecule's likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) or its derivatives in the molecule generally increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: Molecules with a long chain of carbon atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: Molecules containing a sulfur atom usually have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects, but can occasionally have a lower likelihood.
Rule 7: The presence of a nitro group or a sulfonyl group in a molecule are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If the molecule contains multiple functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, amines, esters, etc.), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: The presence of a positive charge on the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a platinum atom, it will increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 11: The likelihood of a molecule causing adverse effects increases if it contains a high number of rotatable bonds.
Rule 12: The presence of sulfur in the structure of a molecule often tends to increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects if ingested or inhaled. As sulfur atoms can react with other molecules and produce toxic compounds.
Rule 13: The presence of a nitrogen atom, especially if part of an amine or amide group, in the molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 14: Molecules labeled as having a side-effect activity or being associated with injury, poisoning, and procedural complications usually contain one or more nitrogen, chlorine, or sulfur atoms.
