Rule 1: Molecules containing a nitrogen atom are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a long chain of carbon atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a chlorine atom are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: Molecules containing a sulfur atom are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: Molecules containing a nitrogen atom with a positive charge are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: Molecules containing a carbonyl group attached to a nitrogen atom are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: Molecules containing a carboxylic acid group are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: Molecules containing a halogen atom are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: Molecules containing a "CN" group are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: Molecules containing a "C(=O)" group are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: Molecules containing a "C(=O)O" group are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: Presence of a carboxylic acid group or its derivatives in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 13: Presence of a nitrogen atom as part of an amine or amide group increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 14: Presence of a halogen atom attached to a carbon atom increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 15: Molecule with a positive charge are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: Molecules containing carbonyl group (C=O) are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: Molecules labeled positive are more likely to contain nitrogen atoms, sulfur atoms, and chlorine atoms in their structure and therefore, are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 18: Molecules containing a polar functional group are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 19: Molecules containing a carboxylic acid group or a sulfonamide group are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 20: Molecules containing a magnesium ion are more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 21: Molecules containing a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 22: Molecules containing a sulfur atom in a heterocyclic ring are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 23: Molecules containing a positive charge, like [Li+], are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 24: Molecules containing a negative charge, like [C-], are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 25: Molecules containing multiple positive charges (like [Au+]) are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 26: Presence of a carbonyl group (-COOH) or its derivatives in a molecule increases likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 27: Presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule, especially if part of an amine group (-NH2), increases likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 28: Presence of a sulfur atom in the molecule, especially if part of a sulfide group (-S-), increases likelihood of causing adverse effects.
