Rule 1: The presence of nitrogen atoms in a molecule is likely to increase the probability of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of chlorine atoms in a molecule is likely to decrease the probability of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of sulfur atoms in a molecule is likely to increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of halogen atoms (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) in a molecule increases the chance of causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: The presence of a sodium ion, a carboxylic acid group, or a sulfonamide group in a molecule's structure indicates potential for adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom and has a positive charge or a carbonyl group and has a negative charge, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors, aromatic rings, heterocyclic rings, or polar functional groups are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a metal ion or a charged group, it's more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: The presence of a carbonyl group in a molecule likely increases the potential for adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule has a high number of carbon atoms and a low number of hydrogen atoms, it's more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: If a molecule has a high number of chlorine atoms or a bromine atom, it's more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: Molecules with a high number of rotatable bonds, hydrogen bond acceptors, or aromatic rings are likely to have more side effects.
Rule 14: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: The presence of a carboxylic acid group or its derivatives, nitrogen atom (especially if part of an amine or amide group), or sulfur atom (especially if part of a sulfonamide or sulfonate group), in a molecule's structure increases the likelihood of adverse effects. These factors aren't foolproof and can be influenced by other variables such as dosage and individual susceptibility.
