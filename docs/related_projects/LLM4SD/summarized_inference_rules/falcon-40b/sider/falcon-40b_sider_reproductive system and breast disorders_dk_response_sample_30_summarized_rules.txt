Rule 1: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond acceptors tend to have a higher probability of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond donors tend to have a lower probability of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with a high number of rotatable bonds tend to have a higher probability of causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of nitrogen atoms in the molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: The presence of carbonyl groups in the molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of aromatic rings in the molecule decreases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: If a molecule contains a halogen atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: If a molecule has a long chain of carbon atoms, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and a nitrogen atom (N) or a sulfur atom (S), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and a chlorine atom (Cl), it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: The presence of a platinum group metal atom in the molecule indicates that it may have reproductive system and breast disorders.
Rule 18: If a molecule contains a nitro group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 19: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group or a sulfonamide group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 20: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) or a nitrogen atom in a certain position (such as the 2nd or 4th position), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 21: The presence of a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) in the structure of a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects, especially if it is attached to a carbonyl group or a heterocyclic ring
Rule 22: The presence of nitrogen atoms, especially if they are attached to a carbonyl group or a heterocyclic ring, increases the likelihood of a molecule causing adverse effects.
Rule 23: The presence of sulfur atoms, especially if they are attached to a carbonyl group or a heterocyclic ring, increases the likelihood of a molecule causing adverse effects.
Rule 24: The presence of halogen atoms, especially fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, in the molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 25: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond acceptors and hydrogen bond donors are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 26: Molecules with multiple functional groups such as amines, carboxylic acids, or sulfonamides are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 27: Molecules containing nitrogen heterocycles such as pyridines, pyrroles, or imidazoles are more likely to cause adverse effects.
