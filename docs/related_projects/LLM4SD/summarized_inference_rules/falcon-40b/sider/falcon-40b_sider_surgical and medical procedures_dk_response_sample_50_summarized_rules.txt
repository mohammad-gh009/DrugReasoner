Rule 1: Molecules containing carboxylic acid groups are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a nitrogen atom in their structure are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with a high number of carbon atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: Molecules with a positive charge are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: Molecules with a negative charge are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: Molecules containing a metal ion are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: Molecules containing a sulfonamide group are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: Molecules containing halogen atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: The presence of a carboxylic acid group in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a nitro group or a sulfonyl group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: If a molecule has a positive or negative charge, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: Molecules with a high number of chlorine atoms or fluorine atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: Molecules with a high number of nitrogen atoms in their structure are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: Molecules with a high number of carbonyl groups or carboxylic acid groups are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: Molecules containing nitrogen as part of an amine or amide group, are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: Molecules containing sulfur as part of a sulfonamide or sulfone group, are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 18: Molecules with a long chain of carbon atoms are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 19: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 20: Molecules containing nitrogen atoms with a positive charge, or are part of a heterocyclic ring, increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 21: The presence of a carbonyl group in a molecule, especially if it is conjugated with another functional group, increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 22: If a molecule contains certain functional groups or chemical structures (such as halogens, amines, sulfonamides, or carboxylic acids), it is more likely to have side effects.
Rule 23: If a molecule interacts with specific receptors or enzymes in the body, it is more likely to have side effects.
Rule 24: If a molecule is administered at high doses or for prolonged periods of time, it is more likely to have side effects.
Rule 25: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 26: If a molecule contains a sulfonate group, it can make a molecule more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 27: Molecules containing chlorine atoms are less likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 28: If a molecule contains certain functional groups or chemical structures (such as halogens, nitrogen and sulfur), it is more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 29: If a molecule contains certain functional groups or chemical structures (such as carboxylic acid, nitrogen and halogens), and if these groups or structures interact with specific biological receptors or enzymes, it is more likely to cause adverse effects. This likelihood is further increased when the molecule is taken in high doses or over a prolonged duration.
