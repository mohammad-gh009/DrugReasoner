Rule 1: The presence of halogen atoms (Cl, Br) in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of nitrogen atoms in the molecule, especially if they are part of a heterocyclic ring or an amine group, increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of sulfur atoms in the molecule, especially if they are part of a heterocyclic ring or a sulfonamide group, increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains an Fe atom with an O atom attached to it, then it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a CCN(C)C group, then it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a Cl atom, then it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: Molecules with a high number of oxygen atoms in their structure are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: Molecules with a high number of carbon atoms in their structure are less likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a positive charge on nitrogen or oxygen atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: If a molecule contains a high number of carbon atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: If a molecule has a long chain of carbon atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom that is bonded to two or more carbon atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom that is bonded to two or more carbon atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group or a sulfonate group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: If a molecule has a high number of hydrogen bond acceptors or donors, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 18: If a molecule has a high number of aromatic rings, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 19: If a molecule has a high number of polar atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 20: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in a certain position, it is more likely to cause adverse effects than if it does not.
Rule 21: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group or a sulfonamide group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 22: If a molecule has a high number of hydrogen bonds, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 23: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 24: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom in its structure, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 25: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 26: If a molecule contains a halogen atom, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
