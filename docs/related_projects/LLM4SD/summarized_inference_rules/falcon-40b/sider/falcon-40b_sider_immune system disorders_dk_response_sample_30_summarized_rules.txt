Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it increases the possibility of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it decreases the possibility of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom, it increases the possibility of causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing an adverse effect.
Rule 5: The presence of a chlorine atom in the molecule decreases the likelihood of causing an adverse effect.
Rule 6: The presence of a sulfur atom in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing an adverse effect.
Rule 7: If the molecule contains a positive charge, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If the molecule contains a negative charge, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If the molecule contains a large number of hydrogen bonds, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: The presence of certain functional groups like amines or sulfonates, in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it increases the likelihood to cause an adverse effect.
Rule 12: If a molecule carries a high number of carbon atoms and a low number of hydrogen atoms, it heightens the probability of causing adverse effects.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains certain functional groups, such as sulfonates or phosphates, it increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 14: The presence of a platinum atom in the molecule decreases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 15: If a molecule has a long chain of carbon atoms, it increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 16: If a molecule contains benzene ring, it increases the possibility of causing adverse effects.
Rule 17: If a molecule has a negative charge, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 18: If a molecule has a high number of carbon atoms and a low number of hydrogen atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
