Rule 1: A molecule is likely to cause adverse effects if it contains a nitrogen atom and has a positive charge.
Rule 2: A molecule is likely to cause adverse effects if it contains a chlorine atom and has a negative charge.
Rule 3: A molecule is likely to cause adverse effects if it contains a sulfur atom and has a negative charge.
Rule 4: The presence of a carboxylic acid group in a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule generally decreases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of a halogen atom in a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule has certain functional groups or chemical structures known to be associated with side effects, such as amines, sulfonamides, or carboxylic acids, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule has a high molecular weight or low water solubility, it is more likely to accumulate in the body and cause side effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule has poor absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties, it is more likely to have limited therapeutic effects and cause side effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a long chain of carbon atoms, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: If a molecule has a high number of carbon atoms and a low number of hydrogen atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: The presence of a carbonyl group in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 14: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom, especially if it is attached to a carbonyl group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: If a molecule contains a halogen atom, especially if it is attached to a carbonyl group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: The presence of a fluorine atom in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 17: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 18: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom in its structure, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 19: If a molecule has a positive charge on any atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 20: If a molecule contains a metal ion, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
