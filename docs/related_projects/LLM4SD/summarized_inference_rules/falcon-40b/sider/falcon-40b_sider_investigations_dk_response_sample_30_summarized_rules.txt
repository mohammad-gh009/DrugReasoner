Rule 1: A molecule containing a nitrogen atom in its structure is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: A molecule with a chlorine atom in its structure is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with a sulfur atom in their structure are more prone to induce adverse effects.
Rule 4: A molecule bearing a nitrogen atom and having a positive charge is likely to cause an adverse effect.
Rule 5: A molecule including a carbonyl group with a negative charge is inclined to trigger adverse effects.
Rule 6: A molecule containing a halogen atom with a positive charge tends to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule includes a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: A molecule with a high number of carbon atoms and a low number of hydrogen atoms tends to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: Molecules with a [H-] group, CN group or CO group tend to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: The presence of a positive or negative charge on a molecule, polar functional groups or a large number of rotatable bonds in the molecule consistently increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group or a sulfonic acid group, it is more likely to produce adverse effects.
Rule 12: The presence of halogen atom decreases the likelihood of causing adverse effects in a molecule.
Rule 13: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule attached to the carbonyl group or a heterocyclic ring enhances the chances to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: The presence of a sulfur atom in the molecule attached to the carbonyl group or a heterocyclic ring tends to trigger adverse effects.
Rule 15: If a molecule with a positive label tends to contain nitrogen atoms, carbonyl groups or halogen atoms in their structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: A molecule with a chlorine atom and a negative charge is prone to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: If a molecule has a high number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors, or a large number of aromatic rings or nitrogen atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 18: A molecule with a sulfur atom and a positive charge is inclined to cause adverse effects.
Rule 19: Molecules with a positive label are more prone to contain nitrogen atoms, carbonyl groups, or halogen atoms.
Rule 20: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom and has a nitrogen atom attached to it, it is likely to trigger an adverse effect.
Rule 21: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom and has a carbonyl group attached to it, it is likely to induce an adverse effect.
Rule 22: If a molecule with a negative charge contains a chlorine atom, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 23: A molecule containing a carbonyl group in its structure is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 24: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom and has a chlorine atom attached to it, then it is likely to cause an adverse effect.
