Rule 1: The presence of a carboxylic acid group in a molecule is associated with increased risk of hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule can either increase or decrease the likelihood of hepatobiliary disorders, depending on other factors in the molecule structure.
Rule 3: The presence of a halogen atom in a molecule is associated with increased risk of hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 4: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a molecule is associated with decreased risk of hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 5: The presence of a chlorine atom in a molecule is associated with increased risk of hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 6: The presence of a sulfur atom in a molecule can either increase or decrease the likelihood of hepatobiliary disorders, depending on the overall structure of the molecule.
Rule 7: A high number of carbon atoms and a low number of hydrogen atoms in a molecule can increase the risk of hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 8: The presence of a long side chain in a molecule is associated with decreased risk of hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 9: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule structure tends to increase the hepatotoxicity potential, although additional factors can influence this effect.
Rule 10: Presence of high number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors, large number of aromatic rings, or high number of polar atoms increase the risk of adverse effects.
Rule 11: Presence of a carbonyl group in a molecule structure increases the risk of hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 12: The likelihood of hepatobiliary disorders increases with a high number of nitrogen atoms or high number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors.
Rule 13: The likelihood of hepatobiliary disorders decreases with a high number of rotatable bonds.
Rule 14: Presence of a nitro group in a molecule structure increases the risk of hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 15: Presence of a long aliphatic chain in combination with a carboxylic acid group increases risk of hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 16: Presence of a platinum group in a molecule structure increases risk of hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 17: If nitrogen atom is in the middle of molecule structure, it increases the likelihood of hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 18: If a chlorine atom is at the end of moleculeâ€™s structure, it increases the likelihood of hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 19: If a carbonyl group is at the end of the molecule's structure, it increases the likelihood of hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 20: Presence of a large number of aromatic rings in a molecule structure decreases the likelihood of hepatobiliary disorders.
