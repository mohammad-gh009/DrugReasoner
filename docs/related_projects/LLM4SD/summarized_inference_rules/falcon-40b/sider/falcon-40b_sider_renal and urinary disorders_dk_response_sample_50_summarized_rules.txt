Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 7: If a molecule has a high number of carbon atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: Molecules containing sulfonamide groups or nitrogen-containing heterocyclic rings are more likely to cause renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 10: Molecules containing carboxylic acid groups or amide bondes are less likely to cause renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 11: Molecules containing aromatic rings or aliphatic chains are less likely to cause renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 12: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group or a sulfonamide group, it is more likely to cause renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom in its structure, it is less likely to cause renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 14: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, it is more likely to cause renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 15: If a molecule contains a metal ion, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: Identify the relevant features or properties of the molecules related to their renal and urinary activity by examining their chemical structures for common patterns or functional groups. 

Rule 2: Use machine learning algorithms such as decision trees or neural networks to build models that can classify new molecules based on their predicted activity. Train these models using labeled data, where each molecule is annotated with its activity label.

Rule 3: Extract the relevant features from the chemical structures of the molecules using techniques such as molecular fingerprints or graph representations. Use these features to train the models and generate the rules that directly relate properties of a molecule to its activity.

Rule 4: Test the models on new molecules to see how well they perform in predicting their activity. Refine the models if necessary by adding more features or adjusting the algorithms' parameters.

Rule 5: Molecules containing a chlorine, sulfur atom or a Gd+3 ion are more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 6: Molecules containing a nitrogen atom are less likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 7: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, sulfonamide group or a nitrogen atom in its structure, it's more likely to cause renal and urinary disorders.

Rule 8: Molecules with a high number of nitrogen atoms, amines, aromatic rings, heterocyclic compounds, polar functional groups, or charged atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.
