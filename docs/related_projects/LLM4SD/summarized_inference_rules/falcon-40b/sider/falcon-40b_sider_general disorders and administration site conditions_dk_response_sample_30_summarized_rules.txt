Rule 1: The presence of halogen atoms in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of nitrogen atoms in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of sulfur atoms in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule has a high number of hydrogen bonds, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of nitrogen atoms in the molecule, especially if they are part of a heterocyclic ring or a quaternary ammonium group, increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 7: The presence of sulfur atoms in the molecule, especially if they are part of a sulfonamide or sulfone group increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 8: The presence of a positive charge on the nitrogen atom in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 9: The presence of a negative charge on the oxygen atom in the molecule decreases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 10: The presence of a positive charge on the sulfur atom in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 11: The presence of certain functional groups such as amines, sulfonamides, and carboxylic acids in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 12: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) or donors (HBD) are more likely to cause adverse effects due to higher affinity for binding to proteins.
Rule 13: Molecules with a high molecular weight (MW) are more likely to cause adverse effects due to accumulation in tissues and organs over time.
Rule 14: Molecules with a high degree of structural complexity are more likely to cause adverse effects due to difficulty for the body to process and metabolize. 
Rule 15: Molecules with a positive label are more likely to contain nitrogen, chlorine, and sulfur atoms in their structure.
Rule 16: A molecule with a long chain of carbon atoms is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: If a molecule contains a positive, negative charge or a polar group, it affects its likelihood to cause adverse effects.
Rule 18: If a molecule contains multiple aromatic rings or heteroatoms, it increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 19: If a molecule contains long chains or branches in its structure, it increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 20: If a molecule has a high number of hydrogen bond donors, a high number of rotatable bonds or a high number of aromatic rings, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 21: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom and a long chain of carbon atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
