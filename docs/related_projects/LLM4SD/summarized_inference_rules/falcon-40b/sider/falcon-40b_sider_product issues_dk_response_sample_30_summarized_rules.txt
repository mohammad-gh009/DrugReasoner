Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom in its structure, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of halogen atoms (such as chlorine or fluorine) in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: The presence of a carboxylic acid group in a molecule increases its potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a halogen atom and it is attached to a carbon atom, it increases the molecule's potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule has a high number of carbon atoms and a low number of hydrogen atoms, the likelihood of it causing adverse effects is high.
Rule 8: If a molecule has a long chain of carbon atoms, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: Molecules with a high number of nitrogen atoms and/or a high number of chlorine atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: Molecules with a high number of carbon atoms and/or a high number of oxygen atoms are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: Molecules with a high number of sulfur atoms and/or a high number of fluorine atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: If a molecule contains a side-chain with a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a side-chain with a sulfonamide group, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: If a molecule has a high number of rotatable bonds, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: The presence of certain functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, amines, sulfonamides) in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 16: The number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors in a molecule can affect its toxicity. Molecules with more than 10 HBA or more than 5 HBD tend to have higher toxicity.
Rule 17: The molecular weight and lipophilicity of a molecule can also affect its toxicity. Molecules with high MW and low logP values tend to have higher toxicity.
Rule 18: The presence of a carbonyl group in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 19: The presence of multiple aromatic rings in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 20: If the molecule contains a positive charge, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 21: If the molecule contains a negative charge, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 22: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom, the negative effect is likely to decrease.
Rule 23: The presence of multiple aromatic rings in a molecule and halogen atoms increases the chance of causing adverse effects.
