Rule 1: Molecules containing a nitrogen atom are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a chlorine atom are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a sulfur atom are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of a carboxylic acid group or its derivatives in a molecule increases the likelihood of adverse effects.
Rule 5: A nitrogen atom in a molecule, especially if part of an amine or amide group, increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: A sulfur atom in a molecule, particularly if part of a sulfonamide or sulfone group, ups the likelihood of adverse effects.
Rule 7: Presence of certain functional groups such as amines, carboxylic acids, and sulfonates increases likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 8: The common structural features among harmful molecules include specific functional groups and ring systems such as benzene or heterocyclic rings.
Rule 9: A carboxylic acid group in a molecule is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: A molecule with a high number of rotatable bonds is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: The presence of a halogen atom (like chlorine or bromine) in a molecule increases likelihood of adverse effects.
Rule 12: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: Molecules containing a sulfonamide group are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: Molecules containing a benzene ring are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: A molecule with a high count of carbon atoms and a low count of hydrogen atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: If a molecule contains a bromine atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: If a molecule contains a platinum atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 18: The presence of a positive charge on a molecule ups its likelihood of causing adverse effects, while a negative charge decreases it. 
Rule 19: If a molecule contains a long chain of carbon atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
