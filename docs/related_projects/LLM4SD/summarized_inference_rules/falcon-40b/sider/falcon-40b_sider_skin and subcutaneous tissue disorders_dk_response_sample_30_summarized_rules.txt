Rule 1: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecular structure increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of a chlorine atom in the molecule decreases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of a sulfur atom in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in a molecule is associated with skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 7: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in a molecule is associated with skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 8: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule is associated with skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 9: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: Molecules with a high number of rotatable bonds (RBs) are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: Molecules with a high number of aromatic rings are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: Molecules with a high number of polar atoms tend to have higher chances of causing adverse effects.
Rule 13: The presence of halogen atoms (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 14: The presence of a positive charge on the molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 15: The presence of certain functional groups or motifs in the molecule can increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 16: The presence of certain structural features in the molecule can also increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 17: The presence of a metal ion in a molecule increases its likelihood of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 18: The presence of a carbonyl group in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 19: If a molecule contains a long chain of carbon atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 20: The presence of a carboxylic acid group or its derivatives in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 21: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule, especially if it is attached to a carbonyl group, increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
