Rule 1: Molecules containing a nitrogen atom are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a chlorine atom are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a sulfur atom are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule has a smile string with a nitrogen atom and a carbonyl group, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 5: If a molecule has a smile string with a nitrogen atom and a carboxylic acid group, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 6: If a molecule has a smile string with a nitrogen atom and a sulfonamide group, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 7: If a molecule has a long chain of carbon atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: The presence of specific functional groups in the molecule such as carboxylic acid group, halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine), or nitrogen atom specially when it is a part of heterocyclic ring, increases its potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 9: The presence of halogen atoms (for example, Cl, Br, I) in the molecule, especially when these atoms are part of a heterocyclic ring or a nitro group, increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects. 
Rule 10: The presence of certain functional groups (for example, carboxylic acids, amines, sulfonamides) in the molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 11: The presence of heavy metal ions (for example, Gd+) or reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the molecule may also increase the likelihood of it causing adverse effects. 
Rule 12: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring makes it more likely for a molecule to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 13: The presence of a halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine in the molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects. 
Rule 14: Molecules with sulfur atoms are less likely to cause adverse effects if they contain a nitrogen atom in their structure.
