Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom in its structure, it also tends to cause adverse effects but reduces the likelihood when compared to nitrogen.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group or a sulfonamide group it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group or a sulfonamide group it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: Large, complex molecules with many functional groups are more likely to have adverse effects than smaller, simpler molecules.
Rule 7: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors, or a high number of aromatic rings or heterocyclic rings, or polar functional groups or charged atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a metal ion or metal complex, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: The presence of multiple functional groups in a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 10: Molecules with high numbers of carbon atoms or a complex structure are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule has a high number of rotatable bonds or a large number of functional groups, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule decreases the likelihood of causing adverse effects if attached to carbonyl groups or carboxylic acid groups.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a platinum group metal or a halogen atom or has a high number of hydrogen bond acceptors or donors, or a high molecular weight, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule has a long chain of carbon atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom in its structure, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule has a high number of carbon atoms, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
