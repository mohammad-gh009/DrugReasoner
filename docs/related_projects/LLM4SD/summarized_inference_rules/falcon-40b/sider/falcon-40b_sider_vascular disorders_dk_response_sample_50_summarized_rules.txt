Rule 1: The presence of a carboxylic acid group in the structure of a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: A molecule that contains a nitrogen atom in its structure is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of a chlorine atom in a molecule structure decreases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: The presence of halogen atoms (e.g., Cl, Br, I) in the molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: Molecules containing nitrogen atoms, especially if they are part of a heterocyclic ring or a quaternary ammonium group, are more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 7: Molecules containing sulfur atoms, especially if they are part of a thiol group or a disulfide bond, are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: The presence of a platinum atom in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a nitro group, it is likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 11: Molecules that contain a sulfonamide group (C=O) are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: If a molecule has a high number of hydrogen bonds, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: The presence of a positive charge in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 14: If a molecule has a negative charge, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: The presence of a polar functional group (such as an amine or carboxylic acid) in a molecule is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: The presence of a sulfonate group in a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 17: Molecules with a high number of rotatable bonds are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 18: The presence of a sulfur atom in the molecule decreases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 19: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 20: If a molecule has a high number of carbon atoms and a low number of hydrogen atoms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
