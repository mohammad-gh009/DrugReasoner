Rule 1: Molecules with a positive charge on nitrogen atoms are more likely to be FDA-approved.
Rule 2: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bonds are prone to be approved by FDA. 
Rule 3: Molecules containing a low toxicity score increase their chances of FDA approval.
Rule 4: The likelihood of FDA approval decreases with the presence of carbonyl groups in the molecule.
Rule 5: Molecules with high numbers of nitrogen atoms and low toxicity have higher chances of becoming FDA-approved.
Rule 6: The presence of nitrogen atoms in a molecule increases its probability of FDA approval.
Rule 7: The presence of halogen atoms in a molecule decreases its chances of FDA approval.
Rule 8: The probability of FDA approval decreases with the presence of a carboxylic acid group in the molecule's structure.
Rule 9: Molecules with a specific structure and functional groups tend to have a higher chance of FDA approval.
Rule 10: Molecules with a high number of carbon atoms and complex structures are less likely to get FDA approval.
Rule 11: A positive charge on any atom in the molecule decreases its probability of being approved by FDA.
Rule 12: Molecules with a higher number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors tend to have a higher chance of FDA approval.
