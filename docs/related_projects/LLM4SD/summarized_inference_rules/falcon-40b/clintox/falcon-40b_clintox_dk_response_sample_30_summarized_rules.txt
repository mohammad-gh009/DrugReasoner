Rule 1: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bonds and low toxicity are more likely to be approved by FDA.

Rule 2: Molecules possessing a positive charge on nitrogen atoms and specifically, low numbers of carbon atoms alongside a high number of oxygen atoms generally have higher chances of approval by FDA.

Rule 3: The presence of nitrogen atoms in the structure of a molecule increases chances of FDA approval, whereas presence of carbonyl groups typically decreases its approval probability.

Rule 4: Molecules with high numbers of aromatic rings tend to more often obtain FDA approval.

Rule 5: Molecules with notably high numbers of carbon atoms likely have higher probability of being approved by FDA.

Rule 6: Molecules possessing a high number of chlorine atoms alongside a low number of fluorine atoms are predicted to be more likely approved by FDA.

Rule 7: A positive charge on oxygen atoms often enhances the likelihood of a molecule receiving FDA approval.

Rule 8: Molecules containing high molecular weights or large sizes may more frequently fail clinical trials due to toxicity reasons.

Rule 9: The molecule should demonstrate a low toxicity profile, with scores of 0 or 1 being more likely to result in FDA approval. 

Rule 10: The molecule structure's stability, with scores of 1, have a greater chance of being approved by FDA.

Rule 11: Molecules with favourable pharmacokinetic profile, such as scores of 1, often have a higher likelihood of FDA approval.

Rule 12: Molecules unable to be approved by FDA frequently include a positive charge on any atom, a nitrogen atom not part of an amine or amide group, and a sulfur atom not part of an amino acid or sulfonamide group.

Rule 13: Molecules containing a high number of oxygen atoms often have a higher probability of FDA approval, unless they also contain a carbonyl or halogen group which will decrease their approval chances.

Rule 14: High levels of complexity and branching within a molecule's structure tend to reduce its likelihood of gaining FDA approval.

Rule 15: The presence of sulfur atoms or fluorine atoms in the structure of a molecule often decreases its chances of being approved by FDA.

Rule 16: Molecules with higher numbers of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors, alongside lower molecular weights, tend to receive FDA approval more frequently.

Rule 17: The presence of a positive charge on carbon atom within a molecule often increases its chances of being approved by FDA. 

Rule 18: Molecules containing notably high numbers of nitrogen atoms along with low toxicity levels are often more likely to receive FDA approval. 

Rule 19: Molecules possessing high numbers of rotatable bonds or aromatic rings have higher chances of FDA approval. 

Rule 20: Molecules with a high number of oxygen atoms and a low number of nitrogen atoms are more likely to be approved by FDA.
