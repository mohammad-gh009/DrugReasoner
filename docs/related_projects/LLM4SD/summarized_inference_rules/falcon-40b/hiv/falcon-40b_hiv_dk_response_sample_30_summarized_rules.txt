Rule 1: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the structure of a molecule increases its possibility of inhibiting HIV replication.
Rule 2: The presence of a carbonyl group in the structure of a molecule is likely to inhibit HIV replication.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a sulfur atom are also potential inhibitors of HIV replication.
Rule 4: A molecule with a carboxylic acid group has a stronger chance to inhibit HIV replication.
Rule 5: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a molecule enhances its ability to inhibit HIV replication.
Rule 6: If a nitrogen atom is part of a heterocyclic ring in a molecule, it can increase the likelihood of inhibiting HIV replication.
Rule 7: The presence of a Br atom in a molecule may increase its chances of inhibiting HIV replication.
Rule 8: The presence of a nitro group in a molecule might help to inhibit HIV replication.
Rule 9: Molecules having high numbers of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors are more likely to inhibit HIV replication.
Rule 10: Molecules having a high number of aromatic rings are likely to inhibit HIV replication.
Rule 11: A molecule with a positive charge at the nitrogen atom in the side chain is more likely to inhibit HIV replication.
Rule 12: A molecule with a chlorine atom attached to the nitrogen atom in the side chain has a higher chance of inhibiting HIV replication.
Rule 13: A molecule with a negative charge at the nitrogen atom in the side chain can inhibit HIV replication.
Rule 14: The presence of a nitrile group in a molecule can be associated with the inhibition of HIV replication.
