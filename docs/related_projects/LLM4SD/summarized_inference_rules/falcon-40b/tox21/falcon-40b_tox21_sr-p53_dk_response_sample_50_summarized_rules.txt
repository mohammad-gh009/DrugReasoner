Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom and has a positive charge, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom and has a negative charge, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom and has a positive charge, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it is more likely to be toxic.
Rule 5: The presence of a chlorine atom in the molecule increases its toxicity.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge and a carbonyl group, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 7: The presence of a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) in the molecule increases its toxicity.
Rule 8: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule, especially if it is part of a heterocyclic ring, increases its toxicity.
Rule 9: If a molecule has a long chain of carbon atoms, it is more likely to be toxic.
Rule 10: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bonds and a low number of rotatable bonds are more likely to be toxic.
Rule 11: The presence of certain functional groups such as amines, nitro groups, and halogens increases the likelihood of toxicity.
Rule 12: The presence of a positive charge on a nitrogen atom (N+) or negative charge on the oxygen atom (O-) attached to the carbonyl group increases likelihood of toxicity.
Rule 13: The presence of a halogen atom, for example a chlorine or bromine atom, in a molecule makes it likely to be toxic.
Rule 14: If the molecule contains a high number of aromatic rings and a low number of nitrogen atoms, it is more likely to be toxic.
Rule 15: The presence of a nitrogen atom, bonded to two carbon atoms, in a molecule increases likelihood of toxicity. 
Rule 16: The presence of certain structural features such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), quinones, and heterocyclic compounds can also increase the likelihood of toxicity.
Rule 17: Molecules with a high number of carbonyl groups and a low number of oxygen atoms are more likely to be toxic.
Rule 18: The presence of a sulfur atom in the molecule indicates increased toxicity.
Rule 19: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group and has a negative charge, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 20: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom and has a negative charge, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 21: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group and a nitrogen atom, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 22: The presence of certain molecular descriptors such as high lipophilicity, low polarizability, and high hydrogen bonding capacity can also increase the likelihood of toxicity.
Rule 23: If a molecule contains a benzoic acid moiety, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 24: The presence of a sulfur atom, especially if it is part of a sulfonamide group, in a molecule increases its toxicity.
Rule 25: The presence of a nitrogen atom that is bonded to a carbonyl group, it is more likely to be toxic.
Rule 26: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it is more likely to be toxic.
Rule 27: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a single hydrogen attached to it, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 28: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom with a single oxygen attached to it, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 29: If the molecule contains a chloroform moiety, it is likely to be toxic.
