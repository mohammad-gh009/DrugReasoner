Rule 1: A molecule is likely to be toxic if it contains a sulfur atom and has a positive charge.
Rule 2: A molecule is likely to be toxic if it contains a nitrogen atom and has a negative charge.
Rule 3: A molecule is likely to be toxic if it contains a chlorine atom and has a positive charge.
Rule 4: Toxicity of a molecule against the heat shock factor response element in the stress response signaling pathway can be related to the presence of a nitrogen atom, sulphur atom, or a chlorine atom in the molecule.
Rule 5: A molecule is likely to be toxic if it contains a chlorine, bromine, or sulfur atom.
Rule 6: A molecule is likely to be toxic if it contains a carbonyl group and has a negative charge.
Rule 7: A molecule is likely to be toxic if it contains a nitrogen atom, chlorine atom, or a carbonyl group and has a specific structure.
Rule 8: A molecule is likely to be toxic if the presence of a halogen atom (e.g., Br, Cl) in the molecule increases its toxicity, the presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule, especially if it is part of a heterocyclic ring, increases its toxicity or the presence of a carbonyl group in the molecule, especially if it is part of an aldehyde or ketone, increases its toxicity.
Rule 9: A molecule is less likely to be toxic if it has a high number of hydrogen bonds and a low number of rotatable bonds or has a high number of aromatic rings and a low number of nitrogen atoms.
Rule 10: A molecule is likely to cause adverse effects if it has a high number of carbon atoms and a low number of hydrogen atoms, has a high number of oxygen atoms and a low number of nitrogen atoms, or a high number of chlorine atoms and a low number of fluorine atoms.
Rule 11: A molecule is likely to cause adverse effects if it contains a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I), a nitrogen atom that is part of a heterocyclic ring (e.g., pyridine, pyrrole), or a sulfur atom that is part of a heterocyclic ring (e.g., thiophene, furan).
Rule 12: The toxicity of a molecule against the heat shock factor response element in the stress response signaling pathway relates to the presence of a certain number of carbon atoms in the molecule and the presence of certain functional groups.
Rule 13: The likelihood that a molecule could cause toxicity is likely if it contains a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I), a carboxylic acid group (e.g., COOH), or a nitrogen atom, especially if it is part of a heterocyclic ring or a nitro group.
Rule 14: A molecule is likely to cause adverse effects if it contains a cyclic structure with a nitrogen atom and an oxygen atom, or a sulfur atom and an oxygen atom, or a carbonyl group and an oxygen atom.
Rule 15: A molecule is likely to be toxic if it contains a chlorine atom and a possesses a specific structure, a nitrogen atom and possesses a specific structure, or a carbonyl group and possesses a specific structure.
Rule 16: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors, aromatic rings or heteroatoms, or polar functional groups are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: A molecule is likely to be toxic if it contains a carboxylic acid group, a sulfonamide group, or a nitro group.
