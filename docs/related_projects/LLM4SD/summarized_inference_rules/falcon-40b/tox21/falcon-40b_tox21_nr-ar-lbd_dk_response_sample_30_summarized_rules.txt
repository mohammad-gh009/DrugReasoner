Rule 1: The presence of a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) in the molecule increases its toxicity.
Rule 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule decreases its toxicity.
Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (e.g., CO, C=O) in the molecule increases its toxicity.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 5: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom and has a positive charge, it is more likely to be toxic.
Rule 6: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (e.g., C=O) and has a negative charge, it is more likely to be toxic.
Rule 7: The presence of a certain functional group or substructure may indicate toxicity. For example, the presence of a sulfonamide group or a benzothiazole ring may increase the likelihood of toxicity.
Rule 8: The number and type of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in a molecule may also affect its toxicity. Molecules with more H-bond donors and acceptors may be more likely to interact with proteins and cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: The size and shape of a molecule may also play a role in its toxicity. Large, bulky molecules may be less likely to penetrate cell membranes and cause damage, while small, hydrophobic molecules may be more likely to accumulate in tissues and cause harm.
Rule 10: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom and a carbonyl group, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 11: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom and a carbonyl group, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 12: The presence of a chlorine atom at any position in the molecule indicates toxicity.
Rule 13: The presence of a sulfur atom at any position in the molecule indicates toxicity.
Rule 14: The presence of a sulfonamide group (e.g., SO2NH2) in the molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 15: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom and has a negative charge, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 16: The presence of a chlorine atom in the molecule decreases its toxicity.
Rule 17: The presence of a sulfur atom in the molecule increases its toxicity.
Rule 18: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (e.g., COOH) in the molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 19: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom that is bound to an androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway, then it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 20: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom that is bound to a carbon atom, then it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 21: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom that is bound to a carbon atom, then it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 22: The presence of a sulfur atom in the molecule decreases its toxicity activity.
Rule 23: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule, especially if it is part of an amine group, increases its likelihood of being toxic.
Rule 24: The presence of a sulfur atom in the molecule, especially if it is part of a sulfonate group, increases its likelihood of being toxic.
Rule 25: The presence of a benzene ring in the structure of a molecule increases its toxicity. 
Rule 26: The presence of a carbonyl group at any position in the molecule increases its toxicity.
Rule 27: The presence of a carbonyl group (e.g., C=O) in the molecule, especially if it is conjugated with other functional groups, can increase its toxicity potential.
Rule 28: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom and has a positive charge, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 29: The presence of a chlorine atom in the molecule decreases its toxicity potential.
Rule 30: The presence of a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br) in the molecule decreases its toxicity potential.
