Rule 1: A molecule's toxicity increases with the presence of a positive charge on it.
Rule 2: A molecule's toxicity decreases with the presence of a negative charge on it.
Rule 3: A molecule's toxicity decreases with the presence of a polar functional group on it.
Rule 4: Molecules containing a carboxylic acid or amine increase a molecule's toxicity.
Rule 5: Molecules containing a carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid group, or nitro group are likely to be toxic.
Rule 6: The presence of a nitrogen, chloronine, or sulfur atom in a molecule increases its toxicity.
Rule 7: Molecules containing sulfonamide group are likely to be toxic.
Rule 8: Molecules containing a chlorine atom and a positive charge, or a carbonyl group and a negative charge, are likely to be toxic.
Rule 9: Molecules containing a bromine atom are likely to be toxic.
Rule 10: Molecules containing halogen atoms increase a molecule's toxicity.
Rule 11: Molecules with a high number of carbon atoms, specific carbon positions, and certain shapes or conformations may have higher toxicity activity against the mitochondrial membrane potential in the stress response signaling pathway.
Rule 12: Molecules containing a sodium ion are likely to be toxic.
Rule 13: Molecules containing a chlorine atom and a positive charge, and those containing a carbonyl group, are more likely to be toxic.
Rule 14: Toxicity activity of a molecule against the mitochondrial membrane potential in the stress response signaling pathway is positively correlated with the number of carbon atoms in the molecule and negatively correlated with the number of oxygen atoms in the molecule.
Rule 15: Molecules containing certain functional groups such as amines, sulfides, and nitriles increase the toxicity of the molecule.
Rule 16: The presence of a positive charge on the nitrogen atom of a molecule increases its toxicity.
Rule 17: Molecules containing a nitrogen atom that is bonded to two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom, or a sulfur atom that is bonded to two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom, or a carbonyl group that is bonded to a nitrogen atom, are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 18: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, aromatic rings or heteroatoms, or polar functional groups are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 19: Molecules containing a nitrogen atom and a positive charge, a carbonyl group and a negative charge, or a chlorine atom are likely to be toxic.
Rule 20: Molecules containing a chlorine atom at the end of the molecule, a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbonyl group, or a sulfur atom bonded to a carbonyl group are predicted to have different toxicities.
Rule 21: Molecules containing carboxylic acid group (COOH) or its derivatives (e.g., esters, amides), nitro group (NO2) or its derivatives (e.g., nitrates, nitrites), or halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) or its derivatives (e.g., chlorinated compounds, brominated compounds) are associated with toxicity.
