Rule 1: The presence of a halogen atom (Cl, Br, I, F) in the molecule tends to increase its toxicity. 
Rule 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule seems to have varying effects on its toxicity depending on other factors, such as charges, associations with other atoms, and its part in specific groups. Generally, its presence decreases toxicity, but in some cases, it can increase toxicity.
Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (CO, C=O, COOH) in the molecule tends to increase its toxicity.
Rule 4: The presence of a benzene ring in the molecule tends to increase its toxicity.
Rule 5: The presence of a sulfur atom in the molecule generally increases its toxicity, although in certain contexts it may decrease toxicity.
Rule 6: The size and shape of a molecule may also play a role in its toxicity, with large, bulky molecules being less likely to penetrate cell membranes and cause damage, and small, hydrophobic molecules more likely to accumulate in tissues and cause harm.
Rule 7: The presence of certain functional groups or substructures (e.g., sulfonamide group or a benzothiazole ring) in the molecule can indicate its toxicity.
Rule 8: The number and type of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in a molecule may affect its toxicity, with molecules having more of these are more likely to interact with proteins and cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a specific atom (nitrogen, chlorine, or sulfur) and also has a defined charge (positive or negative), it may be more likely to be toxic.
Rule 10: The presence of other specific atoms or groups, such as a carboxylic acid group, an amine group, a sulfonamide group, a sulfonate group, or an aldehyde or ketone, can affect a molecule's toxicity.
Rule 11: Features like high degree of branching or binding characteristics (like bonding with an androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor signaling pathway) can suggest a predictive toxicity.
Rule 12: Presence of a gold or bromine atom suggests potential toxicity.
