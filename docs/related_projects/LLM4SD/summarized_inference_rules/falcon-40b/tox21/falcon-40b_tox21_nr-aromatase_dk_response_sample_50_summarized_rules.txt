Rule 1: If a molecule contains aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) binding sites, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) antagonists, it is less likely to be toxic.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating moieties, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 4: Molecules with a large number of aromatic rings, especially those with multiple substituents, increase toxicity likelihood.
Rule 5: Molecules with a high degree of polarity marked by the presence of polar functional groups like carboxylic acids, amines, or alcohols, are likely more toxic.
Rule 6: Molecules with a high molecular weight, especially if they contain heavy elements like halogens or metals, are likely more toxic.
Rule 7: Presence of a chlorine atom in a molecule increases its toxicity potential.
Rule 8: Presence of a sulfur atom in a molecule decreases toxicity potential.
Rule 9: Presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule increases its toxicity potential.
Rule 10: Presence of a zinc ion in a molecule indicates potential toxicity.
Rule 11: Presence of a sulfonamide group in a molecule indicates potential toxicity.
Rule 12: Presence of a high number of aromatic rings and heteroatoms in a molecule indicate potential toxicity.
Rule 13: Presence of a high number of nitrogen atoms in a molecule indicate potential toxicity.
Rule 14: Presence of a high number of carbonyl groups in a molecule indicate potential toxicity.
Rule 15: Presence of a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br) in a molecule increases toxicity potential.
Rule 16: Presence of certain halogen atoms (such as Cl, Br, and F) in a molecule increases toxicity potential.
Rule 17: Presence of aromatic rings in a molecule increases toxicity potential.
Rule 18: Presence of certain functional groups like sulfonates, sulfates, and phosphates in a molecule increases toxicity potential.
Rule 19: The presence of reactive functional groups such as epoxides, quinones, or nitroso compounds in a molecule increases its toxicity potential.
Rule 20: Certain structural features such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), halogenated compounds, or heavy metals in a molecule can cause toxicity due to disrupting cellular processes or accumulating in tissues over time.
Rule 21: Carbonyl group (C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity potential.
Rule 22: A molecule containing a benzene ring, halogen atom (chlorine or bromine), nitrogen atom and has a positive charge is likely more toxic. 
Rule 23: A positive charge on a molecule's nitrogen atom increases its likelihood of being toxic.
Rule 24: A negative charge on a molecule increases its likelihood of being toxic.
Rule 25: If a molecule contains a benzene ring and has a positive charge on any atom, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 26: Presence of reactive functional groups like epoxides, aldehydes, and ketones in a molecule increases its toxicity potential.
Rule 27: Presence of a large number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors in the molecule increases its toxicity potential.
Rule 28: Molecules with high lipophilicity and low aqueous solubility are likely more toxic.  
Rule 29: If a molecule has a chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring, nitrogen atom or a sulfur atom, it is likely to be toxic.
