Rule 1: The likelihood of a molecule being toxic increases if it contains a carboxylic acid group (COOH) or its derivatives such as esters or amides. 

Rule 2: A molecule is likely to be toxic if it contains a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine).

Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom, especially as part of a heterocyclic ring (like pyridine, pyrrole, or imidazole), it is more likely to be toxic.

Rule 4: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge in a molecule increases its toxicity potential.

Rule 5: If a molecule contains a chlorine or sulfur atom with a negative charge, it is more likely to be toxic.

Rule 6: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom along with a positive charge, it can indicate toxicity.

Rule 7: The presence of a long carbon chain can lead to increased toxicity potential in a molecule.

Rule 8: If a molecule contains a benzene ring or a sulfur atom, it may affect its toxicity.

Rule 9: The likelihood of toxicity can increase if a molecule contains certain functional groups like carbonyl or sulfonamide, or a heavy metal like mercury or arsenic.

Rule 10: A molecule is likely to be more toxic if it contains a large number of aromatic rings, heteroatoms, hydrogen bond acceptors and donors, or has a high number of rotatable bonds.

Rule 11: The presence of a nitro group or a nitrile group in a molecule increases its toxicity potential.

Rule 12: The presence and connectivity pattern of multiple aromatic rings in a molecule increases its likelihood of toxicity. 

Rule 13: The presence of functional groups including amines, sulfonamides, and carboxylic acids can indicate toxicity.

Rule 14: Structural features such as long chains, multiple branches, and high molecular weight can increase a molecule's chance of being toxic. 

Rule 15: The presence of halogen atoms, sulfur-containing groups, or polar functional groups, or if a molecule has a high count of aromatic rings or heteroatoms, may increase the probability of toxicity.
