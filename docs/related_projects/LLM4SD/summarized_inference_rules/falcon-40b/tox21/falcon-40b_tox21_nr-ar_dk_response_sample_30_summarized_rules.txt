Rule 4: If the molecule contains a Cl atom and a C=C bond, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 5: If the molecule contains a Si atom and a Cl atom, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 6: The presence of a nitrogen or sulfur atom in the molecule typically increases its toxicity potential.
Rule 7: The presence of a chlorine atom in the molecule typically decreases its toxicity potential.
Rule 8: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom and has a positive charge, it is likely to cause toxicity.
Rule 9: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom and has a negative charge, it is likely to cause toxicity.
Rule 10: The presence of a chlorine atom at any position in the molecule increases its toxicity.
Rule 11: The presence of a nitrogen atom at any position in the molecule decreases its toxicity.

Rule 13: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom and has a negative charge, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 14: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom and has a positive charge, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 15: Molecules with a high number of aromatic rings, heteroatoms, carbonyl groups or amines, halogens or sulfur atoms tend to have higher toxicity activity.
Rule 16: If the molecule has a long chain of carbon atoms, it is more likely to cause toxicity.
Rule 17: The presence of a chlorine atom at the 4th position of the phenyl ring increases the likelihood of toxicity.
Rule 18: The presence of a nitrogen atom at the 4th position of the phenyl ring decreases the likelihood of toxicity.
