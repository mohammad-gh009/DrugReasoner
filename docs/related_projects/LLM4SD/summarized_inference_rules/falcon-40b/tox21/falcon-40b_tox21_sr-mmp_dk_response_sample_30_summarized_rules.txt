Rule 1: The presence of a positive charge on a molecule generally increases its toxicity.
Rule 2: The presence of a negative charge on a molecule generally decreases its toxicity.
Rule 3: The presence of a polar functional group on a molecule may either increase or decrease its toxicity depending upon the type of group.
Rule 4: The presence of a certain type of functional group, like a carboxylic acid or amine, on a molecule generally increases its toxicity.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, a sulfonic acid group, a nitro group, or a sulfonamide group, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 6: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule might increase or decrease its toxicity. This depends upon the other atoms and groups in the molecule.
Rule 7: The presence of a chlorine atom in a molecule might increase or decrease its toxicity, depending on the overall structure of the molecule.
Rule 8: The presence of a sulfur atom in a molecule generally increases its toxicity.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a bromine atom or sodium ion, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 10: The presence of a certain types of functional groups such as amines, sulfonates, carboxylates, sulfides, and nitriles generally increases the molecule's toxicity.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, it is likely to be toxic. However, if the nitrogen atom has a negative charge, it can decrease the molecule's toxicity.
Rule 12: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom, bromine atom, or a carbonyl group, it's more likely to be toxic.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom, a sulfur atom bonded to two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom, or a carbonyl group bonded to a nitrogen atom, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: Molecules with a higher number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, aromatic rings, heteroatoms, polar functional groups, or those containing a high number of carbon atoms in specific positions are more likely to be toxic.
