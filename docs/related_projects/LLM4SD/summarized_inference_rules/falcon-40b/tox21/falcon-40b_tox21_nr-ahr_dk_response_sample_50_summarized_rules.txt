Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 5: The presence of an aryl hydrocarbon receptor binding site in the molecule increases its likelihood of being toxic.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a positive charge, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a negative charge, it is likely to be less toxic.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a high number of aromatic rings or a benzene ring, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a long chain of carbon atoms, it is likely to be toxic.
