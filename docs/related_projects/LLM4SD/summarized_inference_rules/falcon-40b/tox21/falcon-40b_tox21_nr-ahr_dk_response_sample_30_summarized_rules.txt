Rule 1: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, it is more likely to be toxic.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is more likely to be toxic.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it is more likely to be toxic.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine), it is more likely to be toxic.
Rule 5: The presence of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) binding sites in the molecule increases its likelihood of being toxic.
Rule 6: The presence of a positive charge on the molecule increases its likelihood of being toxic.
Rule 7: The presence of a negative charge on the molecule decreases its likelihood of being toxic.
Rule 8: If a molecule has a high number of aromatic rings or contains a benzene ring, it is more likely to be toxic.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a long chain of carbon atoms, it is more likely to be toxic.
Rule 10: The presence of a carbonyl group in the molecule increases its toxicity.
Rule 11: The presence of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) antagonists in the molecule decreases its likelihood of being toxic.
Rule 12: The presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating moieties in the molecule increases its likelihood of being toxic.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom, it is less likely to be toxic.
Rule 14: The presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating groups such as phenols, quinones, and nitroso compounds in the molecule increases its toxicity potential.
Rule 15: The presence of electrophilic centers in the molecule that can react with nucleophilic centers in biological systems increases its toxicity potential.
Rule 16: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom and has a positive charge, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 17: The presence of a nitrogen atom at any position in the molecule decreases its toxicity.
Rule 18: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom and has a positive charge, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 19: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom that is bonded to two or more carbons, it is more likely to be toxic.
Rule 20: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (+), it is more likely to be toxic. 
Rule 21: The presence of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonists or antagonists in a molecule is strongly associated with toxicity. 
Rule 22: The presence of a high number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) or donors (HBD) in a molecule is more likely to cause toxicity.
Rule 23: The presence of halogen atoms (e.g., Cl, Br, I) in the molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 24: The presence of multiple aromatic rings in the molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 25: The presence of certain functional groups (e.g., carboxyl, amine, hydroxyl) in the molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 26: The presence of a sulfur atom in the molecule decreases its toxicity potential.
