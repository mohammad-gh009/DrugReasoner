Rule 1: Molecules containing a sulfur atom and a positive charge are likely to be toxic.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a nitrogen atom with a negative charge are likely to be toxic.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a chlorine atom and a positive charge are likely to be toxic.
Rule 4: Toxicity in a molecule targeting the heat shock factor response element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway and containing a nitrogen, sulfur or chlorine atom is probable.
Rule 5: Molecules containing a chlorine, bromine, or sulfur atom have high chances of being toxic.
Rule 6: Toxicity is likely in a molecule if it contains a chlorine, nitrogen, or sulfur atom at any position.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom and a positive charge, it could be toxic.
Rule 8: Toxicity could be realised in a molecule containing a carbonyl group having a negative charge.
Rule 9: Molecules possessing a chlorine, nitrogen atom or a carbonyl group with a specific structure could be toxic.
Rule 10: Toxicity could increase in a molecule with the presence of a halogen atom, a nitrogen atom as part of heterocyclic of ring or carbonyl group.
Rule 11: Toxicity could be associated with the presence of a heat shock factor response element in the stress response pathway, a high number of aromatic rings, and a low number of nitrogen atoms.
Rule 12: Molecules with a high number of carbon, oxygen, or chlorine atoms and low numbers of hydrogen, nitrogen, or fluorine atoms, respectively, could likely cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: Molecules containing a nitrogen, chlorine or sulfur atom could increase toxicity.
Rule 14: Molecules containing cyclic structures with nitrogen, sulfur, carbonyl, and oxygen atoms are highly likely to be toxic.
Rule 15: If a molecule contains a halogen atom, nitrogen atom with a positive charge, or a sulfur atom with a negative charge, there is a high chance of it being toxic.
Rule 16: Molecules containing a carboxylic acid group, sulfonamide group, or a nitro group are anticipated to be toxic.
Rule 17: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom, long chain of carbon atoms, or a sulfur atom, it could likely be toxic.
Rule 18: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors, aromatic rings or heteroatoms, or polar functional groups could cause more adverse effects.
Rule 19: Molecules containing a Bromine, Nitrogen, or Chlorine atom could be toxic. 
Rule 20: Molecules containing a sulfur atom with positive charge, a chlorine atom with negative charge, or nitrogen atom with a positive charge could likely be toxic.
