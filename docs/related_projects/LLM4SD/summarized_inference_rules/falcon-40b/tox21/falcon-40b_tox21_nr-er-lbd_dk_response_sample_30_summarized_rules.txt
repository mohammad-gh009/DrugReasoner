Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is often likely to be toxic.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it can be toxic.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group, it is generally toxic.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom and carries a positive charge, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom and carries a negative charge, it is often toxic.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom and carries a negative charge, it may be toxic.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, it can be toxic.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom and carries a negative charge, it could be non-toxic.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine), it is more likely to be toxic.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a zinc ion, it could cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom and a carbonyl group, it is generally toxic.
Rule 12: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom and a nitrogen atom, it is typically toxic.
Rule 13: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: Molecules with a high number of aromatic rings or heteroatoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: Molecules with a high number of polar functional groups or charged atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: Molecules with a high number of halogen atoms or nitrogen atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: Molecules with a high number of carbonyl groups or sulfonyl groups are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 18: If a molecule carries a chlorine atom and has a positive charge, it is often toxic.
Rule 19: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom, it is generally toxic.
Rule 20: If a molecule has a large number of carbon atoms and a complex structure, it could be more toxic.
Rule 21: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom and has a positive charge, it is often toxic.
Rule 22: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom and has a negative charge, it is frequently toxic.
Rule 23: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom and has a positive charge, it might be toxic.
Rule 24: Molecules with a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a sulfur atom (S) are less likely to be toxic.
Rule 25: Molecules with a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a chlorine atom (Cl) are generally toxic.
Rule 26: The presence of a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) in a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 27: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule, especially if it is part of a heterocyclic ring or has a positive charge, increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 28: The presence of a carbonyl group (i.e., a functional group containing a carbon double-bonded to an oxygen atom) in a molecule, especially if it is conjugated with other aromatic rings or heteroatoms, increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 29: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group and has a negative charge, it could be more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 30: Molecules with a high number of polar functional groups are more likely to cause adverse effects.
