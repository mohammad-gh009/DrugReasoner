Rule 1: The existence of a carboxylic acid group (COOH) or its derivatives (e.g., esters, amides) in a molecule amplifies its toxicity potential.

Rule 2: The presence of a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I, F) in a molecule boosts the likelihood of toxicity.

Rule 3: The occurrence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule as part of a heterocyclic ring increases the likelihood of toxicity.

Rule 4: If a molecule possesses a nitrogen atom and owns a positive charge, it has a higher chance of being toxic.

Rule 5: If a molecule incorporates a chlorine atom and has a negative charge, it's more likely to be toxic.

Rule 6: If a molecule comprises a sulfur atom with a negative charge, it's inclined to be toxic.

Rule 7: If a molecule encompasses a nitrogen atom and a carbonyl group, it's apt to be toxic.

Rule 8: If a molecule constitutes a sulfur atom and a carbonyl group, it's vulnerable to being toxic.

Rule 9: The existence of a benzene ring in a molecule escalates the chances of it being toxic.

Rule 10: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom and generates a positive charge, it is probable to be toxic.

Rule 11: The presence of a long carbon chain in a molecule surges the chance of being toxic.

Rule 12: If a molecule includes a sulfur atom, it decreases the likelihood of being toxic.

Rule 13: If a molecule has a high count of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors, it has higher toxicity.

Rule 14: If a molecule contains a large number of aromatic rings or heteroatoms, it is more likely to be toxic.

Rule 15: If a molecule encloses a high amount of rotatable bonds, it becomes more likely to be toxic.

Rule 16: If the existence of certain functional groups such as amines, sulfonamides, and carboxylic acids are in a molecule, it can indicate toxicity.

Rule 17: If a molecule contains certain structural features such as long chains, multiple branches, and high molecular weight, it can enhance the likelihood of toxicity.

Rule 18: The presence of halogen atoms (e.g., Cl, Br, I) or sulfur-containing groups make a molecule more prone to toxicity.

Rule 19: If a molecule carries multiple aromatic rings or heteroatoms, it tends to have a higher toxicity potential.

Rule 20: Molecules possessing polar functional groups are more inclined to interact with biological targets, thus, potentially inducing adverse effects.

Rule 21: The presence of a carboxylic acid group or a sulfonamide group in a molecule lifts the chances of toxicity.

Rule 22: The presence of a chlorine atom in a molecule diminishes the chances of toxicity.

Rule 23: If a molecule has a nitrogen atom in a molecule incorporated as part of an amino acid or amine group, and has no other attached functional groups, it tends to inflate the likelihood of toxicity.

Rule 24: The occurrence of a carbonyl group in a molecule, particularly when it is conjugated with another functional group, can escalate the molecule's likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 25: The occurrence of halogen atoms and/or sulfur-containing groups migh indicate potential toxicity in a molecule.

Rule 26: The presence of certain functional groups, such as carboxylic acids, amines, and sulfonamides, in a molecule can increase its toxicity potential.

Rule 27: The presence of a chlorine atom in a molecule increases the likelihood of toxicity.

Rule 28: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule with a positive charge (e.g., N+), increases its toxicity potential.

Rule 29: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in the structure, especially if it is part of an amine or amide group, it increases its toxicity potential. 

Rule 30: The existence of a sulfur atom in the molecule, especially if it is part of a sulfonamide or sulfone group, also increases its toxicity potential.

Rule 31: The existence of a bromine atom in a molecule makes it more likely to be toxic. 

Rule 32: The existence of a nitro group (NO2) in a molecule is associated with toxicity.

Rule 33: Molecules with a high number of polar functional groups tend to have higher toxicity activity.
