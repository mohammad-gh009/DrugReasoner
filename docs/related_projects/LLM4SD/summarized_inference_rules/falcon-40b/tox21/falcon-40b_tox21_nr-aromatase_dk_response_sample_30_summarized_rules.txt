Rule 1: The presence of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) binding sites in the molecule increases its likelihood of being toxic.

Rule 2: The presence of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) antagonists in the molecule decreases its likelihood of being toxic.

Rule 3: The presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating moieties in the molecule increases its likelihood of being toxic.

Rule 4: Toxicity is more likely if the molecule contains a large number of aromatic rings, especially those with multiple substituents.

Rule 5: Toxicity is more likely if the molecule has a high degree of polarity, such as the presence of polar functional groups like carboxylic acids, amines, or alcohols.

Rule 6: Toxicity is more likely if the molecule has a high molecular weight, especially if it contains heavy elements like halogens or metals.

Rule 7: The presence of a chlorine atom in the molecule increases its toxicity potential.

Rule 8: The presence of a sulfur atom in the molecule decreases its toxicity potential.

Rule 9: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule increases its toxicity potential.

Rule 10: The presence of a zinc ion in the molecule indicates potential toxicity.

Rule 11: The presence of a sulfonamide group in the molecule indicates potential toxicity.

Rule 12: Molecules with a high number of aromatic rings and heteroatoms tend to be more toxic than those without.

Rule 13: Molecules with a high number of nitrogen atoms tend to be more toxic than those without.

Rule 14: Molecules with a high number of carbonyl groups tend to be more toxic than those without.

Rule 15: The presence of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) binding sites in the molecule indicates potential toxicity.

Rule 16: The presence of a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br) in the molecule increases the likelihood of toxicity.

Rule 17: The presence of a carbonyl group (e.g., C=O) in the molecule increases the likelihood of toxicity.

Rule 18: The presence of halogen atoms (such as Cl, Br, and F) in the molecule increases its toxicity potential.

Rule 19: The presence of aromatic rings in the molecule also increases its toxicity potential.

Rule 20: The presence of certain functional groups such as sulfonates, sulfates, and phosphates in the molecule increases its toxicity potential.

Rule 21: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, it is likely to be toxic.

Rule 22: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is likely to be toxic.

Rule 23: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it is likely to be toxic.

Rule 24: The presence of a positive charge on the molecule indicates toxicity.

Rule 25: The presence of a negative charge on the molecule indicates toxicity.

Rule 26: The presence of reactive functional groups such as epoxides, quinones, or nitroso compounds in a molecule can cause damage and increase toxicity potential.

Rule 27: The presence of certain structural features such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), halogenated compounds, or heavy metals in a molecule can be toxic due to their ability to disrupt cellular processes or accumulate in tissues over time.

Rule 28: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom and has a positive charge due to nitrogen atoms, or has a negative charge due to carbonyl groups, it is likely to be toxic.

Rule 29: Molecules with high lipophilicity and low aqueous solubility are more likely to be toxic.

Rule 30: Molecules with reactive functional groups such as epoxides, amines, and aldehydes are more likely to be toxic.

Rule 31: The presence of a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, F) in the molecule increases its toxicity potential.

Rule 32: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule, especially if it is part of a heterocyclic ring, also increases its toxicity potential.

Rule 33: The presence of a carbonyl group (e.g., C=O) in the molecule, especially if it is conjugated with other functional groups, also increases its toxicity potential.

Rule 34: The presence of a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) in the molecule decreases its likelihood of being toxic.

Rule 35: The presence of a carboxylic acid group in the molecule decreases its likelihood of being toxic.
