Rule 1: Molecules containing benzene rings, chlorine or nitrogen atoms are likely to be toxic.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a carbonyl group are likely to be toxic.
Rule 3: The universal presence of chlorine, nitrogen or sulfur atoms in any position of the molecule hints towards its toxicity.
Rule 4: Toxicity is likely when a molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, a chlorine atom with a negative charge, or a bromine atom with a positive charge.
Rule 5: A molecule's toxicity increases with the presence of a chlorine atom but decreases with a nitrogen atom; if a carbonyl group is present, toxicity is likely too.
Rule 6: Molecules with carboxylic acid groups, sulfonamide groups, or nitro groups are more likely to be toxic.
Rule 7: Molecules with a high number of carbon atoms, hydrogen atoms, nitrogen atoms, oxygen atoms, chlorine atoms, and fluorine atoms are more likely to be toxic.
Rule 8: Toxicity is likely when molecules contain nitrogen atoms with a positive charge, sulfur atoms with a negative charge, or carbonyl groups with a positive charge.
Rule 9: Toxicity of a molecule rises with the number of its aromatic rings, halogen atoms, and nitrogen atoms. Furthermore, molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond acceptors and low number of hydrogen bond donors, or with a high number of rotatable bonds and a low number of aromatic rings, or with a high number of heavy atoms and a low number of hydrogen atoms, are more likely to be toxic.
Rule 10: The presence of certain atoms at the 4th position of a benzene ring can increase or decrease the likelihood of toxicity.
Rule 11: Toxicity increases with the presence of a nitrogen atom or a carbonyl group in a molecule but decreases with the presence of a chlorine atom.
