Rule 1: Toxicity of a molecule is positively correlated with the number of oxygen atoms present in it.
Rule 2: Toxicity of a molecule is negatively correlated with the number of nitrogen atoms present in it.
Rule 3: Toxicity of a molecule is positively correlated with the number of carbon atoms present in it.
Rule 4: A molecule is likely to be toxic if it contains a Se atom with two oxygen atoms attached to it and one of those oxygen atoms has a hydrogen attached to it.
Rule 5: A molecule is likely to be toxic if it contains a carbon atom with four bonds attached to it and one of those bonds is a double bond to a carbon atom, while the other three are single bonds to hydrogen atoms.
Rule 6: A molecule is likely to be toxic if it contains a nitrogen atom with three bonds attached to it. One of these bonds should be a double bond to a carbon atom and the other two should be single bonds to hydrogen atoms.
Rule 7: Presence of a chlorine atom in a molecule increases its toxicity.
Rule 8: Presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule decreases its toxicity.

Rule 31: The molecule is likely to be toxic if it contains a carbonyl group and has a positive charge.
Rule 32: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bonds especially when it contains a chlorine atom are more likely to cause toxicity.
Rule 33: Molecules with a high number of aromatic rings especially when it contains a nitrogen atom are more likely to cause toxicity.
Rule 34: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bonds especially when it contains a sulfur atom are more likely to cause toxicity.
Rule 35: Toxicity of a molecule is likely if it contains a carboxylic acid group (COOH).
