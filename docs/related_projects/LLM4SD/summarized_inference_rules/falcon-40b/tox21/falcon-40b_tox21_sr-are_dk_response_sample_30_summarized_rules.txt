Rule 1: Toxicity activity of a molecule against the nuclear factor is positively correlated with the number of oxygen atoms in the molecule.
Rule 2: Toxicity activity of a molecule against the nuclear factor is negatively correlated with the number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule.
Rule 3: Toxicity activity of a molecule against the nuclear factor is positively correlated with the number of carbon atoms in the molecule.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a Se atom with two oxygen atoms attached to it, then the molecule is likely to be toxic.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a carbon atom with four bonds attached and one of those bonds is a double bond to another carbon atom, then the molecule is likely to be toxic.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom with three bonds attached to it, and one of those bonds is a double bond to another carbon atom, then the molecule is likely to be toxic.
Rule 7: The presence of a chlorine atom in the molecule increases its toxicity.
Rule 8: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule decreases its toxicity.
Rule 9: The presence of a sulfur atom in the molecule increases its toxicity.

Rule 12: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom and has a positive charge, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 13: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 14: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 15: If the molecule contains a nitro group, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 16: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge and a chlorine atom, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 17: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group and a sulfur atom, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 18: If a molecule contains a phosphorus atom and a sulfur atom, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 19: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom and has a positive charge, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 20: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom and has a negative charge, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 21: If the molecule has a long chain or contains multiple rings, it is more likely to be toxic.
Rule 22: If a molecule contains a Br atom and has a certain number of carbon atoms, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 23: If a molecule contains a Cl atom and has a certain number of carbon atoms, it is likely to be toxic.

Rule 25: If a molecule contains a benzene ring and has a positive charge on one of its atoms, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 26: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom and has a negative charge on one of its atoms, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 27: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom and has a negative charge on one of its atoms, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 28: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 29: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 30: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 31: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (COOH) in the molecule increases its toxicity potential.
Rule 32: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (SO2NH2) in the molecule, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 33: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2) in the molecule, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 34: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom and has a high number of hydrogen bonds, it is likely to cause toxicity.
Rule 35: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom and has a high number of aromatic rings, it is likely to cause toxicity
Rule 36: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom and has a high number of hydrogen bonds, it is likely to cause toxicity.
Rule 37: The presence of a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) in the molecule increases its toxicity activity.
