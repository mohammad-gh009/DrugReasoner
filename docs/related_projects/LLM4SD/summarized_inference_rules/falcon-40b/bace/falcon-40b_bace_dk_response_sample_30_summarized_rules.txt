Rule 1: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule increases its likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1.
Rule 2: The presence of a fluorine atom in the molecule also increases its likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1.
Rule 3: The presence of certain functional groups such as carboxylic acids, sulfonamides or amines in the molecule increases its likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1.
Rule 4: If the nitrogen atom is present in the R group of the molecule, it increases its likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1.
Rule 5: The presence of a chlorine atom in the molecule decreases its likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1.
Rule 6: Bigger or complex shaped molecules have higher chances of inhibiting BACE-1.
Rule 7: The presence of a fluorine atom at position 1 in the molecule is associated with inhibition of BACE-1.
Rule 8: The presence of a nitrogen atom at the end of the molecule increases its likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1.
Rule 9: Presence of a carbonyl group in the molecule is necessary for inhibition of BACE-1.
Rule 10: Presence of a sulfonamide group in the molecule is necessary for inhibition of BACE-1.
Rule 11: The presence of a chlorine atom in the structure of the molecule is necessary for inhibition of BACE-1.
Rule 12: If the molecule contains a Clc1cc2nc(n(c2cc1)C(CC(C)C)CC(=O)NC(C)C)N functional group, then it can inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 13: The presence of a sulfur atom in the structure of the molecule is necessary for inhibition of BACE-1.
Rule 14: The presence of a sulfonamide group in the molecule increases its inhibitory activity against BACE-1.
Rule 15: The presence of a sulfonamide group at the R1 position of the molecule increases its inhibitory activity against BACE-1.
Rule 16: The presence of functional groups such as Fc1cc(cc(F)c1)CC(NC(=O)C(N1CCC(C(O)C(O)C)C1=O)C(OCCC)C1[NH2+]CC(OCCC)C1 and S1(=O)(=O)N([C@]2(C[C@@H]([N@H+](CC2)Cc2cc(OC(C)C)c(O)cc2)C)CN1C)c1cc(F)ccc1 allows the molecule to inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 17: The presence of a fluorine atom at the 4th position of the phenyl ring in the molecule decreases its likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1. 
Rule 18: The presence of a chlorine atom at the 4th position of the phenyl ring in the molecule increases its likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1. 
Rule 19: The presence of a sulfonamide group decreases the likelihood of a molecule inhibiting BACE-1.
