Rule 1: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the structure of the molecule is necessary for the inhibition of human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 2: The inclusion of a carbonyl group in the structure of the molecule is required for the inhibition of human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 3: The inclusion of a fluorine atom in the structure of the molecule is necessary for the inhibition of human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 4: The presence of a sulfonamide group in the molecule increases its likelihood to inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 5: Having a fluorine atom at the R1 position in the molecule reduces its likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom at the R1 position, it is more likely to inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 7: The molecule's structure's carboxylic acid group is a necessary aspect for it to inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 8: The presence of a nitrogen atom or hydrogen atom in the R group of the molecule indicates it can inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 9: The presence of a positive charge at the molecule's nitrogen atom increases its likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1.
Rule 10: The presence of specific functional groups like carboxylic acids, amines, or sulfonamides increases the probability of the molecule inhibiting BACE-1.

Rule 5: The presence of a carbonyl group in the structure of the molecule is necessary for inhibition of human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).

Rule 6: The presence of a sulfonamide group in the molecule decreases its likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1.

Rule 7: The presence of a sulfur atom at the 4th position of the phenyl ring in the molecule decreases its likelihood of inhibiting human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).

Rule 8: The presence of a chlorine atom at the 4th position of the phenyl ring in the molecule increases its likelihood of inhibiting human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).

Rule 9: The presence of a sulfonamide group in the structure of a molecule increases its likelihood of inhibiting human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).

Rule 10: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the structure of a molecule increases its likelihood of inhibiting human β-secretase 1(BACE-1), especially when it is located at the end of the molecule.
