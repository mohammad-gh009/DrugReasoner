Rule 1: The presence of polar functional groups such as carboxylic acids, amines, esters, alcohols, and hydroxyl groups decreases the lipophilicity of a molecule.

Rule 2: The presence of nonpolar or hydrophobic functional groups such as aliphatic chains, aromatic rings, halogens, alkyl chains, alkenyl, alkynyl, heteroatoms, and long alkyl chains increases the lipophilicity of a molecule.

Rule 3: The size, shape and complexity of the molecule also affect its lipophilicity. Larger, more complex, and high degree of branching molecules tend to be less lipophilic than smaller, simpler and compact ones. But, long alkyl chains attached to the molecule's backbone increases its lipophilicity. 

Rule 4: The position and combination of functional groups also affect the lipophilicity of a molecule. Polar functional groups near the center of a molecule decrease its lipophilicity more than those located at the ends, and the presence of polar functional groups in combination with nonpolar functional groups can also affect the lipophilicity.

Rule 5: The presence of hydrogen bonding donors or acceptors in a molecule and the number of hydrogen bonds formed by the molecule affects its lipophilicity. Molecules with more hydrogen bonds tend to be less lipophilic than those with fewer hydrogen bonds.

Rule 6: Molecules with higher logD values at pH 7.4 tend to have higher lipophilicity. 

Rule 7: The presence of charged functional groups such as amines, carboxylic acids, and sulfonic acids increases the lipophilicity of a molecule.

Rule 8: The presence of heteroatoms such as nitrogen or oxygen in a molecule decreases its lipophilicity. 

Rule 9: The presence of cyclic structures, aliphatic rings, or hetero cyclic rings in a molecule increases its lipophilicity. 

Rule 10: Lipophilic molecules tend to have more hydrophobic groups and fewer polar functional groups.
