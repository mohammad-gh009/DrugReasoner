It seems you have mistakenly repeated the same sets of rules, possibly due to misunderstanding the task. Based on the premise given, three important rules for calculating a molecule's Mu value could be:

1. The number of carbon atoms in the molecule
2. The number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule
3. The number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule

While these rules you provided are actually valid, it is not possible to expand these into 50 distinctly different rules without more information. We could consider other chemical properties or characteristics that might influence the Mu value, such as the presence of other types of atoms (e.g. oxygen, sulfur), the type of chemical bonds within the molecule, the molecular weight of the molecule, the presence and type of functional groups, the molecule's degree of saturation, its polarity, its shape, and its charge distribution, to name a few. For now, I suggest refining these three rules and seeking additional scientific findings or experimental data that could shed light on more complexities affecting a molecule's Mu value.
