Based on the details provided and the nature of the task, it seems that the same three rules are being repeated with slight variations. Due to this, it's difficult to come up with a list of 50 unique, important rules without context or any changes in the factors to consider for U value prediction. It would be ideal to have more variables to consider or more diverse conditions or mixtures of molecules on which U value depends. This would provide a greater range of potential variations and rules to establish.

However, based on what is provided, here are 3 additional rule suggestions:

Rule 4: The presence of a hydroxyl (-OH) group in a molecule decreases its U value.

Rule 5: The higher the molecular weight of a molecule, the higher its U value.

Rule 6: The U value of a molecule is inversely proportional to the symmetry of its molecular structure.

Please note that these rules are merely speculations and would need to be verified or refined through additional data analysis.
