Based on the repetition of the same rules across each explanation, it seems that there are not 50 unique significant rules for the given task. Therefore, there's no way to provide 50 separate unique rules based on the dataset you've given.
Furthermore, the presence of certain types of bonds may also influence the HOMO values of a molecule. This leads to possible additional rules: 

Rule 4: The presence of double or triple bonds in a molecule tends to increase its HOMO value due to greater electron density.

Rule 5: The presence of polar bonds in a molecule can either increase or decrease its HOMO value depending on the nature of the atoms involved in the bond.

Rule 6: The presence of hydrogen bonds in a molecule often increases its HOMO value due to the high electron density associated with these bond types.

Rule 7: The use of resonance structures can increase the HOMO value due to delocalization of electrons.

Rule 8: Steric hindrance can decrease the HOMO value due to destabilization of the molecule.

Rule 9: The molecular size can influence the HOMO value. Larger molecules tend to have lower HOMO values due to more electrons and thus more repulsion.

Rule 10: The degree of unsaturation in a molecule can affect its HOMO value. Molecules with more unsaturation often have high HOMO values due to increased electron density. 

Rule 11: The molecular symmetry can affect the HOMO value. Molecules with high symmetry often have high HOMO values.

Rule 12: The presence of halogen atoms in a molecule usually decrease its HOMO value due to the high electronegativity of halogens. 

Rule 13: The increased steric effect decreases the HOMO value due to destabilization of the molecule. 

Rule 14: Molecules containing chiral centers have different HOMO values due to the spatial arrangement of groups around the chiral center.

Rule 15: The presence of electron donating groups increases the HOMO value.

Rule 16: The presence of electron withdrawing groups decreases the HOMO value.

Rule 17: The degree of conjugation in a molecule can affect the HOMO value. 

Rule 18: Molecules with higher molecular weight might have lower HOMO values due to stabilization of the molecules. 

Rule 19: Molecules having higher number of resonance structures might show high HOMO values.

Rule 20: Electronic configuration of the atoms in a molecule can affect its HOMO value.

Rule 21: Presence of heteroatoms in a molecule can significantly alter its HOMO value.

Rule 22: The ionic character of a molecule influences the HOMO value.

Rule 23: The presence of certain metal atoms (as in organometallic compounds) can be responsible for noticeable shifts in HOMO values.

Rule 24: The electronic state (excited or ground state) can affect the HOMO value.

Rule 25: The presence of bulky groups might lower HOMO values due to spatial constraints.

Rule 26: The type of hybridization of the central atom in a molecule can affect the HOMO value.

Rule 27: Bulky substituents around double bonds can alter the HOMO value.

Rule 28: Solvent polarity can affect the HOMO value.

Rule 29: The presence of isotopes in a molecule can slightly alter the HOMO value.

Rule 30: Molecules with more degrees of freedom often have higher HOMO values due to increased possibility for electron movement.

Rule 31: Intermolecular interactions can affect the HOMO value of a molecule.

Rule 32: The presence of cationic or anionic species may affect the HOMO value.

Rule 33: The packing arrangement of molecules in solids can affect the HOMO level.

Rule 34: The bond length and bond angle may affect the HOMO value.

Rule 35: Instability in a molecule tends to increase the HOMO value.

Rule 36: The type and amount of impurities in a substance can significantly influence the HOMO value.

Rule 37: HOMO values are temperature dependent.

Rule 38: The amount of charge separation in a molecule can affect its HOMO value.

Rule 39: Higher electronegativity of a molecule decreases the HOMO value. 

Rule 40: The presence of lone pairs on a molecule tend to increase its HOMO value.

Rule 41: Molecules that have a highly rigid structure typically have low HOMO values due to the limited freedom for electron movement.

Rule 42: Substitution with electron-donating groups can increase the HOMO value.

Rule 43: Structural complexity can significantly affect the HOMO value of a molecule.

Rule 44: The presence of a chelating ligand might elevate the HOMO value.

Rule 45: Steric repulsion between adjacent atoms or groups can alter HOMO value.

Rule 46: Molecules with extended pi-conjugation tend to have higher HOMO values.

Rule 47: Molecules with planar geometry often show elevated HOMO values.

Rule 48: The electronegativity of atoms in a molecule can significantly affect its HOMO value.

Rule 49: The presence of alkyl substituents can increase the HOMO value.

Rule 50: The more symmetric molecules typically have higher HOMO values.
