Based on the given data, it can be inferred that the ZPVE value of a molecule depends on its structure and properties. Therefore, three rules can be formulated to directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the ZPVE value:

Rule 1: The presence of a carboxylic acid group in a molecule increases its ZPVE value.

Rule 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule decreases its ZPVE value.

Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group in a molecule increases its ZPVE value.

These rules can be further refined based on additional data or analysis.
