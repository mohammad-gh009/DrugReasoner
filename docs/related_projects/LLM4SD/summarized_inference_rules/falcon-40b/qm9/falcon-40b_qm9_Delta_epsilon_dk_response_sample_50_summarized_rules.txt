Based on the given data, it can be inferred that the HOMO-LUMO gap value of a molecule depends on its structure and properties. Therefore, three rules can be formulated to directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the HOMO-LUMO gap value:

Rule 41: The presence of halogen atoms in a molecule increases the HOMO-LUMO gap value.

Rule 42: The presence of alkene groups in a molecule decreases the HOMO-LUMO gap value.

Rule 43: The presence of alkyne groups in a molecule tends to decrease the HOMO-LUMO gap value.

Rule 44: The degree of conjugation in a molecule directly influences the HOMO-LUMO gap - higher the degree of conjugation, smaller the gap.

Rule 45: The presence of electron withdrawing groups in a molecule generally increases the HOMO-LUMO gap.

Rule 46: The presence of electron donating groups in a molecule generally decreases the HOMO-LUMO gap.

Rule 47: The steric hindrance within a molecule tends to increase the HOMO-LUMO gap.

Rule 48: The presence of multiple bonds (double or triple) in a molecule tends to significantly narrow the HOMO-LUMO gap due to increased conjugation.

Rule 49: The increased molecular complexity and size typically increase the HOMO-LUMO gap due to the greater number of possible electronic states.

Rule 50: The presence of chiral centers or stereoisomerism in a molecule may cause differences in HOMO-LUMO gap values, especially in the case of compounds with photochemical activity.
