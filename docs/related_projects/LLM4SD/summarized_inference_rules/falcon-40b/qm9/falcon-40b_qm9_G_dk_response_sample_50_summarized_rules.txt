Based on the given data, it can be inferred that the G value of a molecule depends on its structure and properties. Therefore, three rules can be formulated to directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:

Rule 44: The presence of a phosphate group in a molecule increases its G value.

Rule 45: The presence of a halogen atom in a molecule decreases its G value.

Rule 46: The presence of a hydroxyl group in a molecule decreases its G value.

These rules can be further refined based on additional data or analysis.

Based on the given data, it can be inferred that the G value of a molecule depends on its structure and properties. Therefore, three rules can be formulated to directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:

Rule 47: The presence of an alkene group in a molecule increases its G value.

Rule 48: The presence of a cyano group in a molecule decreases its G value.

Rule 49: The presence of an alkyne group in a molecule increases its G value.

These rules can be further refined based on additional data or analysis.

Based on the given data, it can be inferred that the G value of a molecule depends on its structure and properties. Therefore, a rule can be formulated to directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:

Rule 50: The presence of hydrogen bonding in a molecule decreases its G value.

These rules can be further refined based on additional data or analysis.
