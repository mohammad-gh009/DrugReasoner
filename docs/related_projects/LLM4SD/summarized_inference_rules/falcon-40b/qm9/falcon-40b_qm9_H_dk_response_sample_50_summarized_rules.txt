Based on the given data, it can be inferred that the H values of molecules depend on their structures and properties. Therefore, three rules can be formulated to directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the H value:

Rule 46: The presence of halogen atoms (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine) in a molecule tends to decrease its H value.

Rule 47: The presence of alkene groups (carbon-carbon double bonds) in a molecule tends to increase its H value.

Rule 48: The presence of alcohol groups (â€“OH) in a molecule tends to decrease its H value.

Rule 49: The number of stereochemical centers in a molecule affects its H value. Molecules with more stereochemical centers tend to have lower H values.

Rule 50: The presence of alkyne groups (carbon-carbon triple bonds) in a molecule tends to decrease its H value.

These rules can be further refined based on additional data and analysis.
