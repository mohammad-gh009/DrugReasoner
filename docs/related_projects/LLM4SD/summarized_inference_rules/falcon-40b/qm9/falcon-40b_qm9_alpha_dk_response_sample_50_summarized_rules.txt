Apologies for the confusion, but the information seems to be duplicated, and there are not 50 unique rules but only variations of the same three rules, namely:

1. The presence of nitrogen in a molecule increases its alpha value.
2. The presence of oxygen in a molecule decreases its alpha value.
3. The presence of carbonyl groups in a molecule increases its alpha value.

These rules just have variations in wording and explanation but carry the same laid out information about the impact of nitrogen, oxygen and carbonyl groups on the alpha value of a molecule.
