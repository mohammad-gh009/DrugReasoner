Based on the text provided, it seems you are looking for rules that connect Cv value with molecular structure and properties. However, only a limited set of rules were presented multiple times. It's difficult to provide 50 distinct rules without more extensive data or research as Cv values can depend on a myriad of factors. 

Here are a few more potential rules based on general chemistry principles, but please note that these rules are highly situational and may not apply to all molecules:

Rule 4: The presence of a hydroxyl group in a molecule increases its Cv value.

Rule 5: The presence of an alkane chain in a molecule decreases its Cv value.

Rule 6: The presence of an alkyne chain in a molecule increases its Cv value.

Rule 7: A molecule with a higher degree of unsaturation will have a higher Cv value.

Rule 8: Branched molecules generally have lower Cv values than their unbranched counterparts.

Rule 9: The presence of a sulfur atom in a molecule increases its Cv value.

Rule 10: Larger molecules generally have higher Cv values than smaller ones.

Rule 11: The presence of a phosphate group in a molecule increases its Cv value.

Rule 12: The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule increases its Cv value.

Rule 13: The presence of a highly electronegative atom, such as oxygen or fluorine, in a molecule tends to increase its Cv value.

Rule 14: The presence of a halogen in a molecule generally decreases its Cv value.

Rule 15: The presence of an amino group in a molecule can increase its Cv value.

Again, please note that these rules are not absolute and can vary based on the overall structure and chemical environment of the molecule under consideration.
