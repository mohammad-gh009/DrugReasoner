Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule can increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of a halogen atom (such as Fluorine, Chlorine, Bromine, Iodine) in a molecule can increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule can increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. 
Rule 4: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the mitochondrial membrane potential in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 5: The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the mitochondrial membrane potential in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 6: The presence of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure in a molecule can increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects.  
Rule 7: If a molecule contains both a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I), it is likely to cause adverse effects due to its ability to disrupt the mitochondrial membrane potential in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: A molecule containing a bromine atom is likely to cause adverse effects due to its probable toxicity activity against the mitochondrial membrane potential in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) is likely to cause adverse effects due to its probable toxicity activity against the mitochondrial membrane potential in the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 3: A molecule containing a nitro group (-NO2) is likely to cause adverse effects due to its probable toxicity activity against the mitochondrial membrane potential in the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 4: A molecule containing a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, I) is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: A molecule containing a chlorine atom is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains both a nitro group (-NO2) and a chlorine atom (-Cl), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: A molecule containing a bromine atom (-Br) is likely to have increased toxicity activity against the mitochondrial membrane potential in SR signaling pathway.
Rule 8: Molecules containing a benzene ring have a likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 9: A molecule that contains a halogen atom such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine, is likely to be toxic.
Rule 10: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2), a carbonyl group (-C=O) or halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the mitochondrial membrane potential in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
