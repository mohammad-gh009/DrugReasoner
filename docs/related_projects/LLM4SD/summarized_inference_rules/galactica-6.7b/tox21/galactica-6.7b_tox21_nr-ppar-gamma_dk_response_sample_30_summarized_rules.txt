Rule 1: If a molecule contains a bromine atom, it can cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom, it can cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it can cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it can be toxic and cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I), it can be toxic and cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, it can cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) it increases its toxicity activity against the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (-Cl,-Br,-I) it increases its toxicity activity against the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a double bond between carbon atoms, it may be toxic and cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons, it is likely to be toxic and cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: A molecule that contains a nitro group (-NO2) increases its toxicity activity against the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 2: A molecule that contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) increases its toxicity activity against the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 3: A molecule that contains a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) increases its toxicity activity against the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 4: A molecule that contains an aromatic ring is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: A molecule that contains a double bond between carbon atoms is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule doesn't contain any halogen atoms or nitro groups, it is not toxic.
