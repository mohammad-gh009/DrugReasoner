Rule 12: Molecules with certain motifs, such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) binding motif, have higher toxicity.
Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 2: The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 4: The presence of a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) in a molecule can increase its toxicity.
Rule 5: If the molecule contains an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) binding motif, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without a halogen atom.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (such as a ketone or an aldehyde), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If the molecule contains a double bond between carbon atoms (C=C), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: Molecules containing a functional group such as an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) binding motif are likely to cause adverse effects due to its toxicity activity against the AhR in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a functional group such as a thiol group (-SH) are likely to cause adverse effects due its reactivity and ability to form covalent bonds with other molecules.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a functional group such as a nitro group (-NO2) are likely to cause adverse effects due to its ability to react with other molecules and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS).
