Rule 1: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is more likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is more likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a functional group such as a carbonyl group (C=O) or a hydroxyl group (-OH), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without halogen atoms.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (such as a ketone or an aldehyde), it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without a carbonyl group.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a nitro group (such as a nitrite or a nitrate), it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without a nitro group.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: The presence of a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) in a molecule increases its toxicity against the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 13: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity against the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
