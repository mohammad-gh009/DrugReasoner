Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as carbonyl group (C=O) or a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to indicate toxicity, potentially leading to adverse effects.

Rule 2: The presence of a halogen atom like chlorine (Cl), fluorine (F), bromine (Br), or iodine (I) in a molecule's structure hints potential toxicity and adverse effects.

Rule 3: If a molecule contains a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure, its toxicity likelihood increases.

Rule 4: Molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) tend to exhibit increased toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.

Rule 5: Molecules with chlorine atoms (-Cl) are more likely to possess increased toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway.

Rule 6: Existing carbonyl groups (-C=O) in a molecule tend to increase its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway.

Rule 7: The presence of a benzene ring (C6H5) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway.

Rule 8: Any existence of a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons in a molecule increases its likelihood of toxicity.

Rule 9: The presence of a phosphorus atom within a molecule's structure tends to indicate increased toxicity.
Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 2: The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a functional group such as a carbonyl group (C=O) or a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a ring structure such as a benzene ring (C6H5), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: The presence of a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a functional group such as an aromatic ring or a halogen atom, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a functional group such as a carbonyl group or a hydroxyl group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is likely to be toxic against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, iodine or fluorine), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (such as a ketone or an aldehyde), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a double bond between carbon atoms, it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without a double bond between carbon atoms.
Rule 5: Presence of a nitro group (-NO2), carbonyl group (-C=O) or a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor recording pathway. 
Rule 6: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 7: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 8: The presence of a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
