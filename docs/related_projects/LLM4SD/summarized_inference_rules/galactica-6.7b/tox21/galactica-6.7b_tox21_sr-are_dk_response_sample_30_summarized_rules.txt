Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of a bromine atom (-Br) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the nuclear factor (erythroid- derived 2)-like 2 antioxidant responsive element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 5: The presence of a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the nuclear factor (erythroid- derived 2)-like 2 antioxidant responsive element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects. 
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects. If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (such as a ketone or aldehyde), It is also likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects. If a molecule contains a nitro group (such as a nitrite or nitrate), it is also likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.

Rule 8: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: The presence of a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the nuclear factor (erythroid- derived 2)-like 2 antioxidant responsive element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
