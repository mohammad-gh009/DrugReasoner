Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of a bromine atom (-Br) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the heat shock factor response element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway. 
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a functional group such as a carbonyl group (C=O) or a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), or bromine (Br), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the heat shock factor response element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a functional group such as an amide group (-CONH2), it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom (S), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: If a molecule contains a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: If the molecule contains a functional group such as a carbonyl group (C=O) or a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: If the molecule contains both a benzene ring and a chlorine atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a molecule increases the probability of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, or I) in a molecule also increases the probability of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule further increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of a ring structure in a molecule also makes it likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons, it is also likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of a chlorine atom in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the heat shock factor response element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 7: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the heat shock factor response element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway. 
Rule 8: Toxicity increases in molecules containing benzene rings (C6H5). 
Rule 9: The presence of functional groups like "CN" or "CC" in a molecule increases its likelihood of being toxic.
Rule 10: If the molecule contains the functional group "O=C=O", it is likely to cause aderse effects.
Rule 1: A molecule's toxicity increases with the presence of a nitro group.
Rule 2: A molecule's toxicity increases with the presence of a chlorine atom.
Rule 3: A molecule's toxicity increases with the presence of a benzene ring.
Rule 4: The presence of a carbonyl group in a molecule likely indicates potential for adverse effects.
Rule 5: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule is directly related to toxicity activity.
Rule 6: The presence of a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) increases a molecule's likelihood of being toxic.
Rule 7: The presence of a carbonyl group, nitro group, or halogen atom in a molecule increases its toxicity.
Rule 8: Toxicity activity against the heat shock factor response element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway is increased by the presence of a nitro group, chlorine atom, or carbonyl group in a molecule.
Rule 9: A molecule containing a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons is likely to be toxic and cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: Presence of functional groups like a carbonyl group or a nitro group, a halogen atom, or a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon structure in a molecule can cause adverse effects.
