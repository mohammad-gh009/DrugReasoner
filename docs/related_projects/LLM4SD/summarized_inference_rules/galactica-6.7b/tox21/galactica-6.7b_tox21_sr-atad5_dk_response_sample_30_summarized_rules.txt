Rule 1: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the genotoxicity indicated by ATAD5 in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 5: If the presence of a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the genotoxicity indicated by ATAD5 in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 6: If the presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the genotoxicity indicated by ATAD5 in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a functional group such as a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a functional group such as -CN, it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains the functional group -O=C(O)CN(CCN(CC(=O)O)CC(=O)O)CC(=O)O, it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as a carbonyl group (C=O), a halogen atom (for example chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), fluorine (F)), or a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to have toxic effects or cause adverse reactions.
 
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a functional group such as an amide group (-C=O-NH-) or phenyl group (-C6H5), it is more likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.

Rule 3: If a molecule contains a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure or a benzene ring (C6H5), it is likely to exhibit toxic effects or cause adverse reactions.

Rule 4: The presence of these functional groups or structures in a molecule increases their toxicity activity against the genotoxicity indicated by ATAD5 in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.

Rule 5: Specific functional groups in the molecule like carbonyl group (-C=O) or carboxylic acid group (-COOH) increase the likelihood of the molecule being toxic and causing adverse effects.
