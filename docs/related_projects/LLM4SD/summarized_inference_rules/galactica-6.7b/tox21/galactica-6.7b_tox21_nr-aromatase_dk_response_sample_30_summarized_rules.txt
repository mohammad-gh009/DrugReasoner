Rule 1: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (such as a ketone or aldehyde), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (such as a nitrite or nitrate), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 5: The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) in a molecule increases its toxicity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) binding motif, it is likely to be toxic against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 7: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains an aromatic ring, it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without an aromatic ring.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a polar functional group, it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without a polar functional group.
Rule 1: The presence of a halogen atom (chlorine, bromine, or iodine) in a molecule makes it more likely to be toxic.
Rule 2: The presence of a carbonyl group (ketone or aldehyde) in a molecule inflates its probability of being toxic.
Rule 3: Toxicity is more probable in a molecule containing a nitro group (nitrite or nitrate).
Rule 4: A benzene ring in a molecule's structure increases likelihood of adverse effects.
Rule 5: Adverse effects are more likely if the molecule contains a chlorine atom.
Rule 6: Increased toxicity activity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the nuclear receptor signaling pathway can be caused by presence of aryl hydrocarbon receptor binding motif in a molecule.
Rule 7: Presence of an aryl hydrocarbon receptor binding motif combined with a chlorine atom in a molecule amplifies the likelihood of its toxicity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the nuclear receptor signaling pathway.
