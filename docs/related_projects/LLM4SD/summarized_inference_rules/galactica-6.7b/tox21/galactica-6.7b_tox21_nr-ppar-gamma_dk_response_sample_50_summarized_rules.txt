Rule 1: A molecule containing a halogen atom is likely to be toxic and adverse.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) tends to be hazardous and toxic.
Rule 3: A molecule containing a nitro group (-NO2) is possibly toxic or harmful.
Rule 4: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases toxicity against the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor in the nuclear receptor signaling pathway.
Rule 5: The presence of a sulfur atom (S) in a molecule is one of the factors that increase its toxicity against the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor in the nuclear receptor signaling pathway.
Rule 6: A molecule containing a chlorine atom (Cl) is likely to increase toxicity against the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor in the nuclear receptor signaling pathway.
Rule 7: Molecules with a carbonyl group (like a ketone or an aldehyde) are susceptible to being toxic or causing adverse effects.
Rule 8: Toxicity can often be predicted if a molecule has a double bond between carbon atoms.
Rule 9: A molecule with a functional group such as a carbonyl group (C=O) or a nitro group (-NO2) is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: Molecules containing a halogen atom like chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F) are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: Molecules that carry a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure have a higher probability of causing adverse effects.
Rule 12: A molecule is more likely to be toxic if it contains a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons.
Rule 13: The presence of a double bond between carbon atoms 2 and 3 in a molecule's structure might be an indicator of its toxicity activity against a particular receptor in the nuclear receptor signaling pathway.
Rule 14: A molecule containing a benzene ring (C6H6) potentially exhibits toxicity and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule is likely to increase its toxicity.
Rule 2: The presence of a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) in a molecule is likely to increase its toxicity.
Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule is likely to increase its toxicity.
Rule 4: The presence of a benzene ring (C6H5) can increase a molecule's toxicity activity against the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor in the nuclear receptor signaling pathway.
Rule 5: The presence of a bromine atom (-Br) in a molecule can increase its toxicity activity against the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor in the nuclear receptor signaling pathway.
Rule 6: The presence of a phosphorus atom in a molecule is likely to increase its toxicity and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a double bond between carbon atoms, it is likely to be more toxic.
Rule 1: The presence of a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine) in a molecule results in increased toxicity, contributing to adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde), it is linked to increased toxicity, leading to harmful effects.
Rule 3: The presence of a nitro group (such as nitrite or nitrate) within the structure of a molecule intensifies its toxicity.
Rule 4: A molecule containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is likely to showcase toxic properties.
Rule 5: The inclusion of a halogen atom (like chlorine, bromine, or iodine) in a molecule indicates a likelihood of toxicity and possible adverse effects.
Rule 6: Molecules featuring a nitro group (-NO2) may be toxic and cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule possesses a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine), it might be toxic and lead to harmful outcomes.
Please note that these rules are not absolute and should be used judiciously. Advice from a qualified chemist should be taken into account when making decisions based on these rules.
