Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it might be toxic and can potentially cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a molecule could increase its toxicity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom, such as chlorine, bromine, fluorine, or iodine, it might be more likely to be toxic and can potentially cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of a halogen atom in a molecule could increase its toxicity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it might be toxic and can potentially cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule could increase its toxicity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5), it might be toxic against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons, it might be more likely to be toxic than a molecule without a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 5: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 6: The presence of a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 7: The presence of a sulfur atom (S) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a Br atom, it is likely to be toxic against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a Cl atom, it is likely to be toxic against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a P atom, it is likely to be toxic against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
