Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is likely to be more toxic than a molecule without such halogen atoms.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons, it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without such a nitrogen atom.
Rule 6: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity against the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 7: The presence of a sulfur atom in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway. 
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a double bond between carbon atoms (C=C), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a ring structure, it is likely to be toxic. 
Rule 10: The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: Molecules containing a halogen atom (like chlorine, bromine, iodine, or fluorine) are more likely to be toxic or cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) are more likely to be toxic or cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) are more likely to be toxic or cause adverse effects. These groups can increase the molecule's toxicity activity against the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway. The rules should be used as a starting point for more testing and analysis, and used with caution as exceptions exist. Users should also consult with a qualified chemist for further insights.
Rule 1: A molecule containing a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: A molecule that includes a carbonyl group (like a ketone or an aldehyde) is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: A molecule that contains a nitrogen atom is more likely to initiate adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule includes a halogen atom (like chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is more likely to be toxic.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a nitro group (like a nitrite or a nitrate), it is more likely to be toxic.
Rule 6: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its chances of causing adverse effects.
Rule 7: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule raises its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 8: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 9: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 10: The presence of a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: If a molecule holds a bromine atom (Br), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: If a molecule includes a chlorine atom (Cl), it is likely to be toxic and could result in adverse effects.
