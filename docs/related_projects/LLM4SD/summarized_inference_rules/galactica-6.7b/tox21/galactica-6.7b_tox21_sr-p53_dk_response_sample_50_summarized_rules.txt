Rule 1: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (like chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (like a ketone or an aldehyde), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a double bond between carbon atoms, it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a ring structure, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2), a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I), or a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the DNA damage p53-pathway in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the DNA damage p53-pathway in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 2: The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the DNA damage p53-pathway in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the DNA damage p53-pathway in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom (-F) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the DNA damage p53-pathway in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 6: The presence of a sulfur atom (-S) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the DNA damage p53-pathway in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
