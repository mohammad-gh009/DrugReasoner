Rule 1: Molecules containing a halogen atom (such as chlorine, fluorine, or bromine) are more likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (such as a ketone or an aldehyde) are likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a nitro group (such as a nitrite or a nitrate) are likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: Molecules containing benzene ring (C6H5) are likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 6: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 7: The presence of a halogen atom (F, Cl, or Br) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 8: The presence of a chlorine atom in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a double bond between carbon atoms, it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: The presence of a bromine atom (-Br) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons, it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons.
Rule 1: A molecule is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects if it contains a carbonyl group (C=O).
Rule 2: A molecule is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects if it contains a bromine (Br) atom.
Rule 3: A molecule is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects if it contains a chlorine (Cl) atom.
Rule 4: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 5: The presence of a fluorine atom (-F) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine, it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without halogen atoms.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as an alcohol, amine, or carboxylic acid, it can increase the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 8: The presence of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure can increase a molecule's likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 9: The presence of a halogenated structure such as a chlorine or bromine atom can increase the likelihood of a molecule causing adverse effects.
Rule 10: A molecule is likely to be toxic against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway if it contains a benzene ring.
Rule 11: A molecule is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects if it contains a carbonyl group (such as a ketone or an aldehyde).
Rule 12: A molecule is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects if it contains a nitro group (such as a nitrite or a nitrate).
Rule 13: The presence of a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
