Rule 1: A molecule that contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine) is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: A molecule that contains a carbonyl group (such as a ketone or an aldehyde) is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: A molecule that contains a nitro group (such as a nitrite or a nitrate) is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: A molecule containing a carbonyl group (C=O), may not necessarily be related to its toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 5: A molecule containing a chlorine atom, may not necessarily be related to its toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 6: A molecule containing a nitro group (-NO2), may not necessarily be related to its toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 7: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 8: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 9:  The presence of a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 10: The presence of a benzene ring (C6H5) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it's more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of a carbonyl group (such as a ketone or an aldehyde) in a molecule makes it more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: A molecule that contains a nitro group (such as a nitrite or a nitrate) is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 5: The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons, it is more likely to be toxic.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a double bond between carbon atoms, it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, it is likely to be toxic.
Rule 9: The presence of both a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a benzene ring (C6H5) in a molecule makes it more likely to be toxic against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 1: The presence of a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) in a molecule increases its toxicity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.

Rule 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.

Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.

Rule 4: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without halogen atoms.

Rule 5: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.

Rule 6: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (such as a ketone or an aldehyde), it is likely to be toxic.

Rule 7: If a molecule contains a nitro group (such as a nitrite or a nitrate), it is likely to be toxic.
