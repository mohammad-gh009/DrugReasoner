Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it has the potential to cause adverse effects due to its high reactivity and propensity to form covalent bonds forming toxic metabolites.

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom or other halogen atom like bromine or iodine, it is likely to cause adverse effects due to its high reactivity and ability to form covalent bonds, leading to toxic metabolites.

Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom or a nitro group (-NO2), it can increase the likelihood of adverse effects. Nitrogen is highly reactive and can form covalent bonds producing toxic metabolites.

Rule 4: The presence of a benzene ring in a molecule can predict its likelihood to cause adverse effects. Though, the single instance in the context seemed to suggest it doesn't necessarily lead to toxicity.

Rule 5: A molecule containing a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure indicates a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the heat shock factor response element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 5: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the heat shock factor response element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 6: The presence of a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the heat shock factor response element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a functional group such as a carbonyl group (C=O) or a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, such as a benzene ring or a chlorine atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a polar functional group, such as an alcohol or an amine, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: If a molecule contains a reactive functional group, such as a carbonyl group or a double bond, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
