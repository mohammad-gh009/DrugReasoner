Rule 1: The presence of a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) in a molecule is likely to cause adverse effects due to increased toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects as it enhances toxicity.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) are likely to cause adverse effects due to increased toxicity.
Rule 4: The presence of an aromatic ring in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: Molecules containing a sulfur atom (-S) are likely to cause adverse effects due to augmented toxicity.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a bromine atom, it's likelihood of being toxic and causing adverse effects increases.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of a nitro group, a carbonyl group or a halogen atom in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the nuclear factor (erythroid- derived 2)-like 2 antioxidant responsive element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains an aromatic ring, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: The presence of a ring structure in a molecule increases its toxicity.
Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the nuclear factor (erythroid- derived 2)-like 2 antioxidant responsive element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 2: The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the nuclear factor (erythroid- derived 2)-like 2 antioxidant responsive element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the nuclear factor (erythroid- derived 2)-like 2 antioxidant responsive element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine), it is likely to have toxicity activity against the nuclear factor (erythroid- derived 2)-like 2 antioxidant responsive element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 5: The presence of a benzene ring (C6H5) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the nuclear factor (erythroid- derived 2)-like 2 antioxidant responsive element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 6: The presence of a bromine atom (-Br) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the nuclear factor (erythroid- derived 2)-like 2 antioxidant responsive element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
