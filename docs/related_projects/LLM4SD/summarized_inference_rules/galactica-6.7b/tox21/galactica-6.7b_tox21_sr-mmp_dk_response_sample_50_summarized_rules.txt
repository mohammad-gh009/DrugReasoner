Rule 1: Molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) are likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects due to their strong reactivity.

Rule 2: Molecules containing a chlorine atom (-Cl) are likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects due to their disruption of protein and enzyme function.

Rule 3: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) can potentially cause adverse effects due to their strong reactivity and ability to form covalent bonds, leading to the formation of toxic metabolites.

Rule 4: Although some data suggest molecules containing a carbonyl group (C=O) or halogen atoms (Cl, Br, I) can cause adverse effects, the presence of these alone may not necessarily lead to toxicity, emphasizing the importance of a moleculeâ€™s overall structure and properties.

Rule 5: Molecules containing a bromine atom can potentially cause adverse effects due to their ability to disrupt protein and enzyme function.

Rule 6: Molecules containing a halogenated aromatic ring can potentially cause adverse effects due to this functional group's potential to disrupt biological activity.

Rule 7: Molecules containing a nitrogen atom may have increased toxicity causing potential adverse effects due to the atom's inherent reactivity.

Rule 8: Molecules containing a benzene ring (C6H5) can potentially cause adverse effects due to its strong stability, allowing it to interact with biological molecules in a specific way.

Rule 9: Molecules containing a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine) increase their potential toxicity against the mitochondrial membrane potential in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.

Rule 10: Molecules that contain a ring structure are more likely to cause adverse effects due to the strong stability of cyclic structures.
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) in a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of certain substructures in a molecule such as a C=C(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 substructure or a C/C=C(\C)C(=O)OC/C=C(\C)CCC=C(C)C substructure can increase the likelihood of adverse effects.
Rule 7: The presence of a bromine atom in a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 1: A molecule is likely to cause adverse effects if it contains the substructure "CC(=O)Nc1c(I)c(NC(C)=O)c(I)c(C(=O)O)c1I".
Rule 2: A molecule is likely to cause toxicity if it contains the substructure "CN/C(=N/[N+](=O)[O-])NCC1CCOC1".
Rule 3: A molecule is expected to cause adverse effects if it contains the substructure "N#CSCSc1nc2ccccc2s1".
Rule 4: The probability of a molecule causing adverse effects increases if it contains a nitro group (-NO2).
Rule 5: The likelihood of a molecule causing adverse effects is high if it contains a chlorine atom (-Cl).
Rule 6: A molecule is prone to cause adverse effects if it contains a benzene ring (C6H5).
Rule 7: A molecule's toxicity activity against the SR pathway increases if it contains a carbonyl group (-C=O).
Rule 8: The presence of a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule is directly linked to an increase in its toxicity activity against the SR pathway.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) or a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: The presence of a Cl atom in a molecule makes it likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: The presence of a Br atom in a molecule makes it likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a C=C=C group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: A molecule likely causes adverse effects if it contains both a carbonyl group and a chlorine atom simultaneously. 
Rule 15: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is not likely to cause adverse effects.
