Rule 1: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, it is predicted to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is associated with an increased likelihood of toxicity, and it can cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule often indicates an increased likelihood of toxicity against the DNA damage p53-pathway in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
Rule 4: The presence of a benzene ring in a molecule is often associated with toxicity and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a ketone or an aldehyde, these carbonyl groups are likely to confer toxicity and cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: Any molecule containing a nitrite or nitrate (types of nitro groups) is more likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: Molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) are more likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a chlorine atom (-Cl) are more likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a benzene ring (C6H5) are more likely to cause toxicity and adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule can increase its toxicity activity against the DNA damage p53-pathway in stress response (SR) signalling pathway.
Rule 5: The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) in a molecule boosts its toxicity activity against the DNA damage p53-pathway in stress response (SR) signalling pathway.
Rule 6: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the DNA damage p53-pathway in stress response (SR) signalling pathway.
Rule 7: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is more likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: The presence of halogen atoms (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine) in a molecule can increase its toxicity.
Rule 9: Molecules containing a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, iodine) are more likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects. 
Rule 10: The presence of a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the DNA damage p53-pathway in stress response (SR) signalling pathway.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, fluorine, or bromine), it is more likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (such as a ketone or an aldehyde), it is more likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons, it is more likely to cause toxicity and adverse effects.
Rule 14: If a molecule contains a bromine atom (-Br), it is more likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is likely to have toxicity activity against the DNA damage p53-pathway in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
