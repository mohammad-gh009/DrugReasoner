3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (=O), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects. The smiles string for a molecule with a carbonyl group is "C=O".
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, it is likely to be toxic and cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule has a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to be toxic and cause harm.
Rule 3: If the molecule has a chlorine atom, it is expected to be toxic and dangerous.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a halogen atom like chlorine, bromine, or iodine, there are high chances that it would be toxic and harmful.
Rule 5: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule significantly increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 6: If a molecule has a functional group like an aromatic ring or a nitro group, it is more likely to cause damage.
Rule 7: If a molecule has a functional group such as a hydroxyl or a carbonyl group, it is less possibly going to cause harm.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains functional group like a chlorine atom, it is more likely to cause damage.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains the functional group -OH, it is likely to cause more harm.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains the functional group -Cl, it is likely to cause more harm.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains the functional group -Br, it is likely to cause more harm.
Rule 12: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it has a higher chance of being toxic.
Rule 15: If a molecule has a halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine, it is more likely to cause harmful effects.
Rule 16: If a molecule has a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause harmful effects.
Rule 17: If a molecule contains the functional group -OH, it is likely to cause harm.
Rule 18: If a molecule contains the functional group -Cl, it is expected to cause more damage.
Rule 19: If a molecule contains the functional group -Br, it is expected to cause more damage.
Rule 20: The presence of a carbonyl group or nitro group in a molecule significantly increases its toxicity against the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 21: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, it is more likely to be harmful.
Rule 22: If a molecule has the functional group -Cl, it is more likely to cause harm.
Rule 23: If a molecule contains a double bond between carbon atoms (such as C=C), it is likely to be toxic and cause harmful effects.
Rule 24: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is more likely to be harmful.
Rule 1: The presence of a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) in a molecule can increase its toxicity against the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor signaling pathway.
Rule 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule can increase its toxicity against the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor signaling pathway.
Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule can increase its toxicity against the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor signaling pathway.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine or iodine), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (such as a ketone or aldehyde), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons, it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects. 
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without halogen atoms.
Rule 8: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity against the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor signaling pathway.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without nitro groups. 
Rule 10: The presence of a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) in a molecule increases its toxicity against the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor signaling pathway. 
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a nitro group (such as a nitrite or a nitrate), it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without a nitro group.
