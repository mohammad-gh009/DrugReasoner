Rule 9: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to be toxic against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 10: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 11: The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 12: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a halogen atom, it's more likely to be toxic.
Rule 14: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group, it's more likely to be toxic.
Rule 15: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons, it's more likely to be toxic.
Rule 16: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is likely to be toxic against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 17: If a molecule contains a metal ion (such as iron), it is likely to be toxic against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 18: If a molecule contains a reactive functional group, it is likely to be toxic against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 19: If the molecule contains an aromatic ring, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 20: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 21: If the molecule contains a functional group such as an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) binding motif, it is likely to cause adverse effects due to its toxicity activity against the AhR in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 22: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 23: The presence of a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 1: A molecule containing a chlorine atom is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Presence of a benzene ring (C6H5) in a molecule makes it likely to be toxic and potentially harmful. 
Rule 4: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the nuclear receptor signaling pathway.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I) it's toxicity increases against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the nuclear receptor signaling pathway.
Rule 6: In the presence of chlorine, bromine or iodine atoms, a molecule becomes more likely to be toxic. 
Rule 7: The content of a sulfur atom (S) in a molecule increases its activity of toxicity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the nuclear receptor signaling pathway.
Rule 8: If the molecule contains an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) binding motif, it is most likely to be toxic against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the nuclear receptor signaling pathway.
Rule 9: A molecule containing halogen atoms like fluorine, chlorine, or bromine makes it more likely to be toxic than molecules without halogen atoms.
Rule 10: Molecules containing a carbonyl group such as a ketone or an aldehyde, are more likely to be toxic than molecules without a carbonyl group.
Rule 11: Molecules containing a nitro group such as a nitrite or a nitrate are more likely to be toxic than molecules without a nitro group.
Rule 12: If a molecule contains an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) binding motif, it is likely to pose toxicity risk against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.
