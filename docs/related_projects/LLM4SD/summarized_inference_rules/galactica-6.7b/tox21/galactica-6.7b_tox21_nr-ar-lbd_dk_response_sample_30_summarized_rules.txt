Rule 1: The presence of a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine) in a molecule increases its likelihood to cause toxic or adverse effects.  
Rule 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity and makes it more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) e.g. in the forms of ketone or aldehyde, in a molecule increases its toxicity against the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor signaling pathway.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom especially with a lone pair of electrons, it increases its likelihood of being toxic, causing adverse effects. 
Rule 5: Presence of a double bond between carbon atoms increases the likelihood of toxicity in a molecule. 
Rule 6: Presence of a ring structure in a molecule increases its potential of causing adverse effects. 
Rule 7: The presence of a nitrite or a nitrate in a molecule increases its likelihood to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity against the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 6: The presence of a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases its toxicity against the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 7: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity against the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without halogen atoms.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (such as a ketone or an aldehyde), it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without a carbonyl group.
Rule 10: The presence of a sulfur atom (S) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 11: The presence of a chlorine atom (Cl) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
