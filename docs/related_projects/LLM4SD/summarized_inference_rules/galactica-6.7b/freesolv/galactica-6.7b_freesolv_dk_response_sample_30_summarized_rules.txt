Rule 1: The hydration free energy of a molecule in water is directly related to its polarity and hydrogen bonding ability. Increased polarity or stronger hydrogen bonding ability results in higher hydration free energy.

Rule 2: The more carbon atoms a molecule has, the more positive its hydration free energy will be. Larger molecules that have more conformational freedom tend to increase their entropy making them less water favourable.

Rule 3: The hydration free energy of a molecule in water can also be affected by its electronic structure. Presence of electronegative atoms or functional groups in the molecule which has a greater tendency to attract electrons and form polar or covalent bonds tend to have higher hydration free energy.

Rule 4: The size and shape of a molecule also influence its hydration free energy. A larger, spherical molecule will have a lower hydration free energy due to it having increased surface area and reduced mobility, while a smaller, compact, elongated or irregular shape molecule will have a higher hydration free energy.

Rule 5: A molecule that is able to interact with other molecules within the solution or form hydrogen bonds with water molecules will have a lower hydration free energy.

Rule 6: Based on its intermolecular interactions with water molecules either with stronger interactions like hydrogen bonding or weaker interactions like van der Waals forces or electrostatic interactions, one can predict its hydration free energy in water. 

Rule 7: The length of the carbon chain of the molecule also influences its hydration free energy, with longer chains resulting in more positive hydration free energy. 

Rule 8: The presence of polar functional groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids increases the hydration free energy due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding ability of these groups. 

Rule 9: The more hydrophobic a molecule is, the less negative its hydration free energy will be. This is because hydrophobic molecules tend to avoid water and prefer to stay in the organic phase. 

Rule 10: The more hydrogen atoms a molecule has, the more negative its hydration free energy will be, as hydrogen atoms have high electronegativity and can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. 

Rule 11: A molecule's hydration free energy in water can also be affected by its electronic structure, particularly the difference in electronegativity between the atoms bonded to the central carbon atom. A molecule with a higher electronegativity difference between the bonded atoms will have a higher hydration free energy.
