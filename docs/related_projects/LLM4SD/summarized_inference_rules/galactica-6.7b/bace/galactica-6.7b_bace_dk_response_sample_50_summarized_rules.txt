Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the molecule is necessary to inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 2: The molecule's ability to inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1) is enhanced by the presence of a hydrophobic group, such as a phenyl ring or a long chain hydrocarbon.
Rule 3: The capacity of a molecule to inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1) is reduced by the presence of a polar group like an amino group or a hydroxyl group.
Rule 4: The molecule should have a polar functional group, such as an amino group (-NH2) or hydroxyl group (-OH), near the carbonyl group to improve its inhibitory activity.
Rule 5: The presence of a hydrophobic tail at the end of the molecule is necessary for it to bind to the active site of β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 6: The presence of a functional group like an amide or an amine group in the molecule is critical for inhibiting β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 7: The molecule's ability to inhibit β-secretase 1(BACE-1) depends on the length and flexibility of its carbon chain.
Rule 8: The ability of a molecule to inhibit β-secretase 1(BACE-1) can be negatively affected by the presence of a polar functional group like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid group. 
Rule 9: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule is critical for its ability to inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 10: The molecule should have a hydrophobic tail at one end and a hydrophilic head at the other for it to bind to the active site of human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 11: The presence of a halogen atom (such as fluorine or chlorine) in the molecule increases its ability to inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 12: The inhibitory ability of a molecule on human β-secretase 1(BACE-1) is affected by the number and position of the functional groups in the molecule. 
Rule 13: The presence of a nitrogen atom, a flexible carbon chain, and a carbonyl group are important factors in determining whether a molecule can inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 1: The presence of either a Nitrogen atom or a Carbonyl group (C=O) in the molecule is crucial for inhibiting human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 2: Hydrophobic groups like Phenyl rings or long chain Hydrocarbons in the molecule enhance its ability to inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 3: Polar Functional groups such as amine, hydroxyl, and alcohol attached to the Nitrogen atom or near the Carbonyl group increase the inhibitory activity towards BACE-1.
Rule 4: Extent of the molecule's inhibitory action towards BACE-1 is also dependent on the length, size, shape and flexibility of the molecule.
Rule 5: The presence, position, and number of Fluorine atoms or other Halogen atoms in the molecule can also affect its ability to inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 6: Ability to penetrate the cell membrane and blood-brain barrier is associated with the molecule's inhibitory action on BACE-1.
Rule 7: A molecule's polarity and hydrophobicity has notable influence on its ability to inhibit BACE-1. 
Rule 8: Presence of functional groups such as amides or amines in the molecule is essential for its inhibitory action on BACE-1.
Rule 9: The distribution, number, and arrangement of functional groups in the molecule, notably around the Carbonyl group, impacts its inhibitory ability on BACE-1.
Rule 10: Molecules with polar groups such as amino groups(-NH2) tend to have reduced ability to inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 1: The existence of a carbonyl group (C=O) within the molecule is a crucial factor for inhibiting human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 2: The length and adaptability of the molecule's carbon chain play a significant role in its capability to inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 3: The incorporation of polar functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH) or amino (-NH2) groups within the molecule improves its inhibitory ability against human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 4: The inclusion of a hydrophobic group like a phenyl ring or a long chain hydrocarbon in the molecule enhances its inhibitory action against human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 5: The integration of a polar group, for example, an amino group (-NH2), in the molecule reduces its capacity to inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 6: The presence of a polar group like an amino group (-NH2) or a hydroxyl group (-OH) in the molecule diminishes its effectiveness in inhibiting human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 7: The molecule should have a polar functional group such as an amino (-NH2) or hydroxyl (-OH) group in proximity to the carbonyl group to improve its inhibitory effect.
Rule 8: There should be a hydrophobic tail at the end of the molecule in order to facilitate its binding to the active site of human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
