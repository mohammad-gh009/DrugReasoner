Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the molecule is essential for inhibiting human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 2: The molecule should have a polar functional group such as an amino group (-NH2) or hydroxyl group (-OH) near the carbonyl group to enhance its inhibitory activity.
Rule 3: The molecule should have a hydrophobic region near the carbonyl group to allow it to bind to the active site of BACE-1.
Rule 4: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule is essential for inhibiting human β-secretase 1 (BACE-1).
Rule 5: The length and flexibility of the molecule's carbon chain affect its ability to inhibit human β-secretase 1 (BACE-1).
Rule 6: The presence of a hydrophobic group such as a phenyl ring or a long chain hydrocarbon in the molecule enhances its ability to inhibit human β-secretase 1 (BACE-1).
Rule 7: The number and position of fluorine atoms in the molecule affect its ability to inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 8: The presence of a polar functional group such as an ammonium ion (NH4+) or hydroxyl group (OH-) in the molecule enhances its ability to inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 9: The presence of a functional group such as an amide or an amine group in the molecule is essential for inhibiting human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 10: The presence of halogen atoms such as fluorine or chlorine in the molecule can increase its lipophilicity and improve its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, which is important for inhibiting human β-secretase 1(BACE-1) in the brain.
Rule 11: The number and position of functional groups in the molecule affect its ability to inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the molecule is essential for inhibiting human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 2: The number and position of halogen atoms (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine) in the molecule affect its ability to inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 3: The presence of a hydrophobic group (such as a phenyl ring or a long chain hydrocarbon) in the molecule enhances its ability to inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 4: The presence of a polar group such as an amino group (-NH2) in the molecule reduces its ability to inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 5: The number and position of functional groups in the molecule affect its ability to inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 6: The length and flexibility of the molecule's carbon chain affect its ability to inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 7: The presence of polar functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH) or amino (-NH2) groups in the molecule enhances its ability to inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
Rule 8: The molecule should have a polar functional group such as an amino group (-NH2) or hydroxyl group (-OH) near the carbonyl group to enhance its inhibitory activity.
Rule 9: The molecule should have a hydrophobic tail at the end of the molecule to facilitate its binding to the active site of human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
