1. Rule 4: The U value of a molecule is directly influenced by the presence or absence of any conjugation. The more conjugated a system is, the lower its U value as the energy required to excite an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is lower.
2. Rule 5: Molecules with higher symmetrical structures have lower U values as the uniform distribution of atomic nuclei and electrons results in reduced electron repulsion, leading to lower potential energy.
3. Rule 6: A molecule's U value is influenced by its total valence electrons. If the total valence electrons are not paired, more energy is needed for atom movement and thus the U value is higher.

24. Rule 27: The U value can increase as a result of the presence of bulky functional groups due to the increase of steric clashes.

4. Rule 4: The U value of a molecule is also influenced by the geometry of the molecule. The more steric strain or torsional strain a molecule has, the higher its U value becomes. This can be illustrated in molecules with high internal energy due to destabilizing conformations such as steric repulsion between large groups.
5. Rule 5: The U value is highly dependent on the temperature to which the molecule is exposed. As temperature increases, so does kinetic energy, resulting in a higher U value.
