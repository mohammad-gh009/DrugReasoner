Rule 1: The octanol/water distribution coefficient (logD at pH 7.4) of a molecule increases as the number of carbon atoms in its hydrophobic chain increases.
Rule 2: The logD value of a molecule decreases as the number of hydrogen atoms in its polar group(s) increases.
Rule 3: The logD value of a molecule increases as the molecular weight of its polar group(s) increases.
Rule 4: The logD of a molecule is directly related to its hydrophobicity, which is determined by the number and position of hydrophobic groups such as alkyl chains, aromatic rings, and functional groups like alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones.
Rule 5: The logD of a molecule can be affected by its molecular size, shape, and flexibility, with larger and more rigid molecules generally having lower logD values than smaller and more flexible molecules.
Rule 6: The logD value is also influenced by the molecule's capacity to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. Molecules with polar functional groups that can form such bonds may have higher logD values.
Rule 7: The influence of electronic properties on the logD value is also significant. Molecules with lone pairs of electrons on nitrogen or oxygen atoms or possessing acidic or basic functional groups can have altered logD values.
Rule 8: The presence of polar functional groups in the molecular structure, the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and the pH of medium can all affect a molecule's logD value. 
Rule 9: The ionization state of a molecule at physiological pH, its polar surface area, and its potential interactions with other compounds in the system, such as proteins or lipids, can also influence a molecule's logD value.
Rule 1: The octanol/water distribution coefficient (logD at pH 7.4) of a molecule is directly related to its hydrophobicity, which can be predicted by calculating the logP value of the molecule. The higher the logP, the greater the hydrophobicity, the lower the logP, the greater the hydrophilicity.
 
Rule 2: The logD value of a molecule is influenced by its ionization state at physiological pH, and thus more polar ionized forms have higher logD value than neutral, less polar forms. 

Rule 3: The logD value is also affected by molecular size, shape, and electronic structure. Larger molecules or molecules with complex structures and the presence of certain functional groups can have higher logD value.

Rule 4: LogD can also quantify the molecule's lipophilicity, which affects its ability to cross biological membranes and interact with other molecules in the body. The influence of functional groups and their position on the molecule is also considered in this measure. 

Rule 5: LogD also takes into account the conformational flexibility of a molecule, affecting the value based on the presence of different conformations in solution. Hydrogen bonds or other intermolecular interactions can also affect the molecule's logD value.

Rule 6: The logD of a molecule will increase as the number of carbon atoms in its hydrophobic chain increases. 

Rule 7: The logD of a molecule increases as the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in its structure increase.

Rule 8: The logD of a molecule decreases as the molecular weight of the molecule increases, assuming all other factors remain constant.

Rule 9: The presence of polar functional groups (e.g. alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, amides, carboxylic acids) increase the logD value while the presence of aromatic rings decreases it.

Rule 10: The logD of a molecule decreases as the number of hydrogen atoms in its polar group(s) increases, and it increases as the molecular weight of its polar group(s) increases.

Rule 11: The logD of a molecule is relative to its hydrophobic groups (e.g. alkyl chains, aromatic rings, functional groups like alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones) and its electronic properties. A molecule with polar functional groups or charged atoms may have a higher logD value than a molecule without these groups.

Rule 12: The logD value of a molecule increases as the number of hydrogen atoms in its polar functional group decreases and it increases as the molecular weight of its polar functional group increases.

Rule 13: The logD of a molecule increases as the number of polar functional groups increase in the molecule.
