Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group associated with endocrine disorders, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: A molecule with high lipophilicity is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: A molecule with high molecular weight is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of a halogen atom in the molecule increases chances of causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: The presence of a carbonyl group in the molecule increases chances of causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of a nitro group in the molecule increases chances of causing adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains an endocrine disruptor group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a halogenated aromatic ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 9: A molecule with a polar functional group is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a ring structure, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: Molecules containing functional groups associated with skin irritation, genotoxicity, or are known endocrine disruptors are more likely to have adverse effects.
Rule 12: The presence of a metal ion, such as platinum or technetium, in a molecule increases chances of causing adverse effects.
Rule 13: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to endocrine disorders.
Rule 14: The presence of functional groups that can form covalent bonds with other molecules or that can form hydrogen bonds can increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects. 
Rule 15: If a molecule contains a functional group such as an amino group (-NH2) or a hydroxyl group (-OH), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to endocrine disorders. 
Rule 16: Molecules containing functional groups like amide groups or sulfonamide groups are more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 17: If a molecule contains a functional group such as an endocrine disruptor, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: Molecules containing a chlorine atom, carbonyl group (-C=O), or a nitro group (-NO2) are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules with a carbonyl group (C=O), nitro group (-NO2), or halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) might cause adverse effects related to endocrine disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a functional group such as an amide, imide, urea group, halogen atom, or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure, it increases the chances of causing adverse effects associated with endocrine disorders.
Rule 4: The presence of a functional group associated with endocrine disorders or polar functional group, or a ring structure, may indicate the likelihood of a molecule causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), nitro group (-NO2), or a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule is a significant indicator of its potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a functional group such as a carbonyl group (C=O), nitro group (-NO2), halogen atom, or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: A functional group that's associated with endocrine disorders or skin irritation or causes liver damage in a molecule increases the chances of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 8: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2), halogen atom, or a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule may increase its chances of causing adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in addition to a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to endocrine disorders.
Rule 10: Functional groups known to cause endocrine disorders, sulfonamide group known to cause skin irritation, or a nitro group known to cause liver damage, present in a molecule increase the chances of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 11: Molecules with a high lipophilicity (highly hydrophobic) or a high polar surface area (PSA) or a high molecular weight are more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 12: The presence of a chlorine atom or a nitrogen atom or a carbonyl group can possibly dictate if a molecule would cause adverse effects.
