Rule 5: Molecules containing a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: Molecules with a nitro group (-NO2) are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: Molecules with a carbonyl group (-C=O) can cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5), it can cause adverse effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 9: Molecules that contain a functional group known to cause adverse effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions are likely to cause adverse effects in humans.
Rule 10: Molecules containing a polar functional group are more likely to cause adverse effects than non-polar molecules. 
Rule 11: Molecules containing a chlorine atom (-Cl) are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: Molecules with a peptide bond (-CO-NH-) can lead to adverse effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.

Rule 14: If a molecule contains a sodium ion (Na+), it can cause adverse effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 15: Molecules with high molecular weights are more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 16: The presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure in a molecule can cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: Dosage and duration of exposure to a molecule can affect its potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 18: Molecules containing functional groups such as an alcohol, phenol, or carboxylic acid tend to have adverse effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 19: Molecules with certain functional groups or substructures, like a carbonyl group (-C=O), show potential to cause adverse effects by interacting with biological molecules.
Rule 20: Molecules with high lipophilicity (i.e., ability to dissolve in lipids) are more likely to cross cell membranes and interact with biological molecules, which can lead to adverse effects.
