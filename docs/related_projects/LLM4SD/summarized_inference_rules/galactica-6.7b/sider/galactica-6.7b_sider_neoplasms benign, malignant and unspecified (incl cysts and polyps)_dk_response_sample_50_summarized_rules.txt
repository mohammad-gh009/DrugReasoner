Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to tissue damage, inflammation, cancer and also neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps).
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to tissue damage, inflammation, cancer and also neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps).
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to tissue damage, inflammation, cancer and also neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps).
Rule 1: Molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a both nitro group and a carbonyl group are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: Molecules containing a chlorine atom (-Cl) are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: Molecules containing a benzene ring (C6H5) are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains functional groups like a carbonyl group or a nitro group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: High molecular weight molecules are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: Molecules containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: Molecules containing any functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, amides, esters or carboxylic acids are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: Molecules containing any halogen atoms such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: Molecules containing any aromatic rings are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group (SO2-R) are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: The occurrence of a carbonyl group (C=O) within a molecule elevates the probability of it causing harmful effects due to its high reactivity and potential to disrupt protein structures.
Rule 2: The presence of a halogen atom (for instance, chlorine or fluorine) within a molecule raises the likelihood of harmful effects, as these atoms can facilitate the formation of harmful metabolites and disrupt protein structures.
Rule 3: Molecules carrying a nitro group (-NO2) have an increased risk of causing adverse effects, again due to potential toxic metabolite production and interference with protein function. 
Rule 4: The incorporation of a bromine atom within a molecule raises the likelihood of it causing neoplasms that can be benign, malignant, or unspecified.
Rule 5: The occurrence of a nitrogen atom within a molecule increases the possibility of it causing neoplasms that can be benign, malignant, or unspecified.
Rule 6: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases the chance of it causing neoplasms that can be benign, malignant, or unspecified.
Rule 7: The presence of a phosphate group (PO4) in a molecule can increase the chance of it causing neoplasms that can be benign, malignant, or unspecified.
Rule 8: The presence of a chloride ion (Cl-) in a molecule can increase the chance of it causing neoplasms that can be benign, malignant, or unspecified.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains both a carbonyl group (C=O) and a benzene ring, it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps).
Rule 10: The presence of a benzene ring in a molecule is more likely to cause adverse effects.
