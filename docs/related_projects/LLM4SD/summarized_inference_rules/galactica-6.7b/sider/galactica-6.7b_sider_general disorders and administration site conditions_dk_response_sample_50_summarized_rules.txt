Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, such as a sulfonamide group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, it is either more or less likely to cause adverse effects, depending on other factors.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a polar functional group, such as an amino group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 8: If the molecule contains any functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, amides, esters, or carboxylic acids, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If the molecule has a high lipophilicity, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If the molecule has a high molecular weight, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: If the molecule contains a halogenated aromatic ring, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Rule 14: If a molecule contains a phenyl group (C6H5), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Rule 15: If the molecule has a polar surface area greater than 140 square angstroms, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, such as a nitro group or a sulfonamide group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group known to cause adverse effects, including sulfonamide, nitro (-NO2), halogen, carbonyl (C=O), aldehydes, ketones, amides, and carboxylic acids, it is more likely to cause adverse effects. 

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a notorious atom or group, such as chlorine atom or a halogen atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 3: If a molecule has a high molecular weight or complex structure, it could likely lead to more adverse effects.

Rule 4: The presence of certain specific functional groups such as nitro group (-NO2), carbonyl group (C=O), chlorine atom (-Cl), and a sulfonamide can cause adverse effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.

Rule 5: If a molecule possesses a high lipophilicity, the likelihood of that molecule causing adverse effects is heightened.

Rule 6: If a molecule contains a ring structure, including a benzene ring (C6H5), it can influence the effect of the molecule, sometimes leading to less adverse effects, but in other cases leading to more.

Rule 7: If a molecule contains polar functional groups, like a hydroxyl group, this increases its chances of causing adverse effects. 

Rule 8: The existence of specific groups, such as carboxylic acid group (-COOH), a phenyl group (C6H5), or a piperazine group (C4H8N2) in a molecule may result in adverse effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions. 

Rule 9: The presence of multiple functional groups known to cause adverse effects like a combination of a sulfonamide and a nitro group can increase the likelihood of the molecule causing adverse effects.
