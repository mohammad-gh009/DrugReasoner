Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as an amide group, a carboxylic acid group, a carbonyl group (C=O), an ester, or a group associated with endocrine disorders such as an estrogenic or androgenic group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to endocrine disorders.
Rule 2: The presence of a halogen atom (including fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or silver) in a molecule raises the likelihood of it triggering adverse effects linked to endocrine disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule has a high lipophilicity or contains a polar functional group, it is prone to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: Molecules containing a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), ring structure, or long chain of carbon atoms, are more likely to cause adverse effects related to endocrine disorders
Rule 5: If a molecule is high in molecular weight it's more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases the possibility of it causing adverse effects related to endocrine disorders.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a chemical element such as arsenic (As) or nitrogen, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: Molecules containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) are likely to cause adverse effects associated with endocrine disorders.
Rule 1: Molecules containing a phosphorus atom are likely to cause adverse effects related to endocrine disorders.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a chlorine atom are likely to cause adverse effects related to skin irritation.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a gold atom are likely to cause adverse effects related to allergic reactions.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a functional group associated with endocrine disorders, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a polar functional group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: Molecules containing a ring structure are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: Molecules with a high molecular weight are more likely to cause adverse effects.
