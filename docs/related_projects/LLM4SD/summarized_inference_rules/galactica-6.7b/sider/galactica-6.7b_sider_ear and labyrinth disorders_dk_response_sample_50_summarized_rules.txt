Rule 5: Molecules containing a chlorine atom may lead to skin and respiratory disorders.
Rule 6: Molecules with a carboxylic acid group are more prone to cause gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 7: Molecules with a carbonyl group (-C=O) are potentially linked with various disorders.
Rule 8: Molecules containing a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) could potentially cause skin and eye disorders.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a functional group known to cause ear and labyrinth disorders, skin irritation, liver damage etc, it could cause adverse reactions.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide, chlorobenzene, or acetaminophen group, it can potentially cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: Molecules with a chlorine atom may cause skin and respiratory disorders.
Rule 12: Molecules with a benzene ring (C6H5) could potentially cause neurological disorders.
Rule 13: Molecules containing multiple functional groups that are known to cause adverse effects, are also likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: Molecules with a nitro group (-NO2), carbonyl group (-C=O), halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I) are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: The presence of a benzene ring in a molecule is generally an indicator of potential adverse effects.
Rule 16: A molecule with a ring structure is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: The presence of a carbonyl group and a nitro group in a molecule increases the chance of adverse effects. 
Rule 18: The presence of a halogen atom and a nitro group in a molecule increases the likelihood of adverse effects.
Rule 19: The presence of a functional group known for skin irritation or liver damage increases potential adverse effects.
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to result in adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of both a nitro group (-NO2) and a chlorine atom (Cl) in a molecule increases the possibility of adverse effects.
Rule 4: Presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the molecule significantly raises the potential for adverse effects.
Rule 5: If the molecule contains a benzene ring it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of a halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine within the molecule escalates the chances of adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a Pt(II) ion or a Gd(III) ion, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), a piperazine group (-C4H8N2), or a phenyl group (-C6H5) in a molecule increases the likelihood of adverse effects.
Rule 9: If the molecule contains functional groups known to cause ear and labyrinth disorders, skin irritations, or respiratory problems, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains an amide group or a halogenated aromatic ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: The presence of certain atoms such as sulfur, fluorine, gold, nitrogen, or phosphorus in a molecule can also indicate potential for adverse effects.
Rule 12: The presence of a functional group, such as a hydroxyl group (-OH), decreases the likelihood of causing adverse effects. 
Rule 13: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), halogen atom, or nitro group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders.
Rule 14: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom (-S), it can cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
