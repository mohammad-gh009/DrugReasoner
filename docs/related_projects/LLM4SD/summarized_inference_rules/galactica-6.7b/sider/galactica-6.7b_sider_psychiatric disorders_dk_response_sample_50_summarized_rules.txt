Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If the molecule contains a bromine atom (Br), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If the molecule contains both a nitro group (-NO2) and a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: The presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 8: If the molecule has a high lipophilicity, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If the molecule has a high molecular weight, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5), it is less likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders.
Rule 7: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a molecule is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: The presence of a chlorine atom in a molecule is likely to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders.
Rule 9: The presence of a nitro group in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 10: The presence of a halogen atom, such as fluorine, in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 11: The presence of a benzene ring in a molecule is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Note: The presence of these groups and atoms in a molecule often result in an increase in reactivity and interaction with biological molecules such as proteins and DNA, leading to damage and possibly adverse effects. However, these rules are not absolute and should be used with discretion under the guidance of a qualified chemist, as there may be other contributing factors.
