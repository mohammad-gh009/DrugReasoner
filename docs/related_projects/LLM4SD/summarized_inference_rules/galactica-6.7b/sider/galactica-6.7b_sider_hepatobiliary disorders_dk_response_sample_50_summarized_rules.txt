Rule 1: Molecules containing functional groups like alcohol, aldehyde, or ketone, or a nitro group (-NO2), or sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), or carboxylic acid group (-COOH) are more likely to cause adverse effects. The presence of these functional groups makes the molecule more likely to interact with biological systems and cause toxicity. 

Rule 2: Molecules containing halogen atoms such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine, or chlorine atom (-Cl) are more likely to cause adverse effects. This is due to the ability of halogen atoms to interact with biological molecules which can lead to toxicity. 

Rule 3: Molecules containing a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure are more likely to cause adverse effects. This is because these substances tend to stay in the environment for longer periods and get accumulated in living organisms causing harm. 

Rule 4: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) tend to increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects as carbonyl groups can interact with biological molecules leading to toxicity. 

Rule 5: Molecules bearing a benzene ring (C6H5) or a nitro group along with a carboxylic acid group are highly likely to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders.

Rule 6: Molecules containing functional groups like amidine group (-C(=NH)-NH-) or a guanidine group (-C(=NH)-NH-) are likely to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. 

Rule 7: Molecules containing a halogenated aromatic ring are more likely to cause adverse effects related to dermatological disorders. 

Rule 8: Molecules containing a nitro group along with a carboxylic acid group or a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) are associated with hepatobiliary disorders. 

Rule 9: Molecules containing functional groups like a carbonyl group (C=O) or a hydroxyl group (-OH), or a nitro group are often associated with adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. 

Rule 10: Hydroxyl group (-OH) presence in a molecule is a significant indicator of its potential to cause adverse effects. 

Rule 11: Molecules containing a calcium ion or a nitrogen atom or both are more likely to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. 

Rule 12: Molecules that have the presence of an amide, imide, or urea group are likely to result in hepatobiliary disorders. 

Please note that while the mentioned rules suggest a high likelihood of causing adverse effects, they are not absolute and other factors may influence the overall outcome.
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. This is due to nitro groups' ability to interact with biological molecules leading to toxicity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl), it can cause adverse effects related to dermatological disorders. Conversely, if a molecule contains a bromine atom (-Br), it may likely cause adverse effects related to respiratory disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects linked to hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I), it increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects, as fluorine atoms' high electronegativity may interact with other biological molecules, resulting in toxicity and adverse effects.
Rule 5: Molecules containing functional groups such as amidine, guanidine, or a halogenated aromatic ring may also cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. 
Rule 6: Molecules containing a benzene ring (C6H5) have been linked to adverse effects relating to neurological disorders.
Rule 7: The presence of substructures such as "C1=CC(=CC=C1NC(=NC(=NCCCCCCN=C(N)N=C(N)NC2=CC=C(C=C2)Cl)N)N)Cl", "C1=CC(=C(C=C1CCN)O)O" or "C[C@H]1/C=C/C=C(\C(=O)NC\2=C(C3=C(C(=C4C(=C3C(=O)/C2=C/NN5CCN(CC5)C)C(=O)[C@](O4)(O/C=C/[C@@H]([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H]([C@H]1O)C)O)C)OC(=O)C)C)C)C)O)O)/C" can increase the likelihood of causing hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 8: Presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) may induce adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 9: Sulfonamide groups (-SO2NH2) in a molecule have been associated with adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. Lastly, 
Rule 10: Amidine or guanidine groups also have been noted to contribute to hepatobiliary disorders.
