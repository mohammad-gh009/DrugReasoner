Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause eye disorders, such as from sulfonamides, halogen atoms (fluorine, chlorine, bromine etc.), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structures, amides, imides, ureas, benzene rings, nitro groups (-NO2), or carboxylic acids, it is more likely to have side effects related to eye disorders.
  
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a functional group known to cause skin irritation, such as from sulfonamides, nitro groups (-NO2), or benzene rings, it is more likely to have a side effect related to skin irritation.

Rule 3: If a molecule contains a functional group known to cause respiratory problems, it has a higher chance of eliciting side effects related to respiratory problems.

Rule 4: Molecules with certain properties, for instance, having a high molecular weight, are more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 5: Molecules containing a polar functional group or aromatic/halogen moieties are more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 6: The presence of certain groups or atoms such as a carbonyl group (-C=O), nitro group (-NO2), chlorine atom (-Cl), or a Ga+3 ion can enhance the likelihood of a molecule causing adverse effects related to eye disorders.

Rule 7: Any molecule that contains a benzene ring, nitro group, halogen atom, or a carbonyl group are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains both a carbonyl group and a chlorine atom, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains an aromatic ring, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If the molecule has a polar functional group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If the molecule has a high molecular weight, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause eye disorders, it is likely to have a side effect related to eye disorders.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause skin irritation, it is likely to have a side effect related to skin irritation.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause respiratory problems, it is likely to have a side effect related to respiratory problems.
Rule 10: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, it is more likely to cause eye disorders.
Rule 11: If the molecule contains a halogen atom, it is more likely to cause eye disorders.
Rule 12: If the molecule contains a hydroxyl group (-OH), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders.
Rule 13: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders.
Rule 14: If the molecule contains a halogenated aromatic ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders.
Rule 15: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders.
Rule 16: If a molecule contains a functional group such as an amide or a carboxylic acid, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders.
Rule 17: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders.
Rule 18: If the molecule contains a long chain of carbon atoms, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders.
Rule 19: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 20: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it is likely to cause eye disorders.
