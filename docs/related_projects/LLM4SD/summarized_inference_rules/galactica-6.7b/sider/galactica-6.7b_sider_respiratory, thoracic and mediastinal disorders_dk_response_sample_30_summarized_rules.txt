Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 5: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 6: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a phosphorus atom (P), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom (-S), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 9: If the molecule contains a functional group such as an amidine group (-C=NH-), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 10: If the molecule has a high lipophilicity, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If the molecule has a high molecular weight, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: If the molecule contains a halogenated aromatic ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 13: If the molecule contains a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 14: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 15: If the molecule contains any functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, amides, or carboxylic acids, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
