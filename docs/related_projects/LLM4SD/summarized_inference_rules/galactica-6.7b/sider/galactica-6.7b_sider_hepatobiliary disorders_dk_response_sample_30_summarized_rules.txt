Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects, specifically related to hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with a carbonyl group (-C=O) are more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 4: The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) in a molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects, with a particular emphasis on dermatological disorders.
Rule 5: The likelihood of a molecule causing adverse effects related to neurological disorders is increased if it contains a nitro group(-NO2). 
Rule 6: Molecules containing a sulfur atom (-S) might lead to respiratory disorders due to adverse effects.
Rule 7: The presence of a benzene ring (C6H5) in a molecule can potentially cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: Molecules with a hydroxyl group(-OH) can also cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group(-COOH), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 10: Halogenated aromatic rings present in a molecule may lead to adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 11: Molecules containing both nitro group and a carboxylic acid group might cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders.
Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 2: The presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 3: The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 4: If a molecule contains a halogenated aromatic ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders.

Rule 5: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders.

Rule 6: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders.

Rule 7: If the molecule contains a functional group known to cause adverse effects in the liver and bile duct, such as an amidine group, it is likely to cause hepatobiliary disorders.

Rule 8: If the molecule contains a functional group known to cause adverse effects in the skin, such as a sulfonamide group, it is likely to cause dermatological disorders.

Rule 9: If the molecule contains a functional group known to cause adverse effects in the nervous system, like a piperazine group, it is likely to cause neurological disorders.

Rule 10: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders.
