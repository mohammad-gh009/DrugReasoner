Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to surgical and medical procedures.
Rule 2: If the molecule includes a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to surgical and medical procedures.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (can be either fluorine -F, chlorine -Cl, bromine -Br or iodine -I), it is predicted to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to surgical and medical procedures.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to surgical and medical procedures.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to surgical and medical procedures.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects such as a sulfonamide group or a quinolone group, it is likely to cause adverse effects as well.
Rule 8: If the molecule contains a tertiary nitrogen atom (-N(CH3)3) or a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to surgical and medical procedures.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a chloride ion (Cl-) or a platinum ion (Pt+2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to surgical and medical procedures.
Rule 10: If the molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, such as a sulfonamide group, a nitro group or a carboxylic acid group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If the molecule contains a functional group that is polar like an alcohol group, it is likely to cause adverse effects as well.
Rule 12: If the molecule contains a metal ion like gold, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: If the molecule contains a cyclic structure, it has a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 14: If the molecule contains a hydroxyl group (-OH), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
