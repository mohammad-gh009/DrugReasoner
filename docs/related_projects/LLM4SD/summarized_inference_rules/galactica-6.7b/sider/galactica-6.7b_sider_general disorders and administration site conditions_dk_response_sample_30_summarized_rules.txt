Rule 1: Molecules containing a functional group known to cause adverse effects, such as a sulfonamide or a nitro group, are more likely to cause such effects.
Rule 2: A molecule with multiple known adverse-effect causing functional groups is more likely to cause such effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with high molecular weight or high polarity are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of a halogenated aromatic ring in a molecule increases the chances of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: High lipophilicity in a molecule increases the chances of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: Molecules containing a function group known for causing adverse effects are likely to evoke similar effects in other molecules.
Rule 7: The presence of a functional group such as an amide or ester in a molecule increases its chances of causing adverse effects.
Rule 8: Functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, amides or carboxylic acids in a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 9: Molecules with a carbonyl group (C=O), nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: The presence of a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) in a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 12: Molecules with a high lipophilicity or high molecular weight have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects.
