Rule 1: Molecules containing functional groups known to cause adverse effects, such as nitro groups (-NO2), sulfonamide groups, or carbonyl groups (-C=O), are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing ring structures, like benzene rings, or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structures are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a polar functional group, such as an amino group, or has high polarity, it's more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: Molecules with a high molecular weight or a complex structure are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: Molecules with a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I), including fluorine, chlorine, or bromine, are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: Molecules containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) or a tertiary amine group (-N(CH3)3) are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: Molecules containing functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds are more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 8: Molecules with high lipophilicity are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: Molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) are likely to cause adverse effects due to their potential toxicity and ability to react with biological molecules.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a chlorine atom can cause adverse effects due to chlorine's high reactivity with various body molecules, leading to potential tissue damage. 
Rule 3: Molecules that have a carbonyl group (-C=O) could cause adverse effects due to the potential toxicity of the carbonyl group reacting with other body molecules.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, amides, or carboxylic acids, it may cause adverse effects as such molecules can interact more with biological systems.
Rule 5: Molecules containing any metals such as gold, sodium, or cobalt are prone to cause adverse effects due to their interaction with biological systems.
Rule 6: Molecules that contain nitrogen-based functional groups such as amides, ureas, or guanidines might cause adverse effects due to their higher likelihood to interact with biological systems. 
Note: These rules act as guidelines and could lack accuracy. They should be considered a starting point to further investigations.
