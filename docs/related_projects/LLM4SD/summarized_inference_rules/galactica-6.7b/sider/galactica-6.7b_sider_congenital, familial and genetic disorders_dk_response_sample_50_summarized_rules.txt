Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If the molecule has a high molecular weight or a complex structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If the molecule has a high polarity, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a functional group known to cause adverse effects, such as a sulfonamide group, it increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a polar functional group, such as an amino group or a hydroxyl group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a functional group such as [Fe]=O.O=[Fe], it is likely to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial and genetic disorders.
Rule 12: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: If the molecule contains a halogenated aromatic ring, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: If the molecule contains a polycyclic structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: If the molecule has a high lipophilicity, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a functional group known to cause adverse effects, such as a sulfonamide group, benzene ring, carboxylic acid group, phenyl group, or a hydroxyl group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: The presence of a chlorine atom in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of a benzene ring (C6H5) in a molecule can potentially cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains multiple functional groups known to cause adverse effects, such as a combination of a sulfonamide and a nitro group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group known to cause adverse effects, such as a sulfonamide, nitro or halogen group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule potentially increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: A molecule that contains a halogen atom, such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine, is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: The existence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule heightens the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
