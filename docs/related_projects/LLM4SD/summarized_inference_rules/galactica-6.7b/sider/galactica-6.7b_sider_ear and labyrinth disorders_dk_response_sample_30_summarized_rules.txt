Rule 1: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: Specific associations between molecular structure and adverse effects include nitro groups with ear and labyrinth disorders, carbonyl groups with ear and labyrinth disorders, and halogen atoms with ear and labyrinth disorders.
Rule 7: The presence of a nitro group, carbonyl group, or halogen atom can increase the production of reactive oxygen species leading to oxidative stress and damage to DNA, proteins and lipids, causing inflammation, tissue damage, and potential cancer.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains functional groups known to cause ear and labyrinth disorders, skin irritation, or respiratory problems, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains both a nitro group (-NO2) and a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders.
Rule 11: The presence of a nitro group, carbonyl group or halogen atom can interact with biological molecules such as proteins and enzymes, leading to potential toxicity and adverse effects.
Rule 12: If a molecule contains a functional group known to cause liver and kidney disorders, it is likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 13: If the molecule contains a nitro group but lacks a carbonyl group, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
