Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of a benzene ring (C6H5) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: The presence of a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, such as a nitro group, sulfonamide group or a halogen group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a polar functional group or a ring structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule has a high molecular weight or complex structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule has a high polarity or a high lipophilicity, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If the molecule contains any functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, amides, or carboxylic acids, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If the molecule contains any aromatic rings, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, such as a nitro group or a sulfonamide group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule has a high molecular weight or a complex structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, such as a sulfonamide group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, such as a halogen group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 13: The presence of a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 14: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
