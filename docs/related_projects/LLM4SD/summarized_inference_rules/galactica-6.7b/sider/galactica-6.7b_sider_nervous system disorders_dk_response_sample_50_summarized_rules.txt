Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders.
Rule 5: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders.
Rule 6: If the molecule contains an ionizable group such as [NH+](=O)[O-].[Na+] or a radioactive element such as [O-][99Tc](=O)(=O)=O.[Na+], it is likely to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a functional group such as (C1CCC2O)CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C, (CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)C2=CC=C(N2C)CC(=O)[O-], (CC1(OC2CC3C4CCC5=CC(=O)CCC5(C4(C(CC3(C2(O1)C(=O)CCl)C)O)F)C)C)C, (CC1=C(C=C(C=C1)N2C(=O)C(=C(N2)C)N/N=C/3\C=CC=C(C3=O)C4=CC(=CC=C4)C(=O)O)C)C, or (C1(=C(N=C(C(=N1)Cl)N)N)C(=O)N=C(N)N.Cl) it is likely to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders.
Rule 8: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to the skin. 
Rule 9: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders.
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to the nervous system.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to the nervous system.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to the nervous system.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to the nervous system.
Rule 5: If the molecule contains a phosphorus atom, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders.
Rule 6: If a molecule has more complex structures and more functional groups, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule has simpler structures and fewer functional groups, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
