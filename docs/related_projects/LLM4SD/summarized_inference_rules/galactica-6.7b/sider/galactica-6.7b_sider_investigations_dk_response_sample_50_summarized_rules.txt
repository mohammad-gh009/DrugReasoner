Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group including nitro group (-NO2), carbonyl group (C=O), benzene ring, sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), or other groups prone to cause adverse effects, the molecule is then likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule comprises a halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, it potentially causes adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of high molecular weight and high polarity in the molecule suggests a greater likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: The existence of a ring structure, for instance, a benzene ring, in the molecule enhances the possibility of it causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: A molecule possessing a chiral center tends to be correlated with the occurrence of adverse effects.
Rule 6: A molecule harboring multiple functional groups causing adverse effects, confer a chance for adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a metal ion like platinum or arsenic, it tends to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to have adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I), it can likely cause negative effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule has a chlorine atom, it is predisposed to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If the molecule has a nitrogen atom, it can lead to adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains known adverse effect inducing functional groups, such as a sulfonamide group or a benzene ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a hydroxyl group (-OH), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule has a complex structure featuring multiple functional groups known to cause adverse effects, it is more likely to have adverse effects.
Rule 9: High molecular weight or complex structure can make a molecule more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 10: Molecules that are highly polar are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a functional group which can form hydrogen bonds, it is more likely to have adverse effects. 
Rule 12: If a molecule contains a functional group that could react with other molecules, it may lead to adverse effects.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a functional group that can form covalent bonds, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: If a molecule has a high molecular weight or polarity, it is likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 15: The presence of a functional group known to cause adverse effects, such as a sulfonamide, make it more likely for the molecule to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 16: The presence of a halogenated aromatic ring makes a molecule more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: A molecule containing a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 18: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it is more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 19: The presence of a ring structure, such as a benzene ring, in a molecule increases its likelihood to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is potentially harmful.
Rule 2: If a molecule includes a carbonyl group (-C=O), it may trigger adverse reactions.
Rule 3: The presence of a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases the likelihood of it leading to harmful effects.
