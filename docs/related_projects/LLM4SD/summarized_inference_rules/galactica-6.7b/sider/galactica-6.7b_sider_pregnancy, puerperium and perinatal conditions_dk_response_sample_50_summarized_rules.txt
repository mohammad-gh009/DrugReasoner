Rule 1: Molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) have an increased chance to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules that contain a carbonyl group (-C=O) may also cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) could potentially lead to adverse effects.
Rule 4: Molecules that have a chlorine atom may similarly cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains an amide group (-C=O-NH-), an alcohol group (-OH), or a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 7: Presence of a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) can indicate potential adverse effects.
Rule 8: The presence of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure signifies a likelihood for causing adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a functional group such as a nitrite or a nitrate (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains an alcohol, phenol, or carboxylic acid, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If the molecule contains a ring structure, it faces an increased chance of causing adverse effects.
Rule 12: Molecules containing functional groups that are known to cause adverse effects in certain circumstances (like pregnancy) are likely to cause similar adverse effects.
Rule 13: Presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) in a molecule could potentially increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 14: If a molecule contains a functional group such as an amide, sulfonamide, or guanidine group, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 15: If a molecule contains a halogenated aromatic ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it can cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Should a molecule contain a benzene ring (C6H5), it's more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: Molecules containing halogen atoms such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: The chance of adverse effects increases if the molecule has a carbonyl group.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a functional group known to cause adverse effects during pregnancy, it's more likely to cause similar adverse effects.
Rule 7: Molecules with polar functional groups like an amino group or hydroxyl group are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: Ring structures within a molecule, like a benzene ring, increase the chance of adverse effects.
Rule 9: The presence of a peptide bond in a molecule increases the likelihood of adverse effects on pregnancy.
Rule 10: Molecules with high molecular weight or high polarity are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: Molecules featuring a functional group known to cause skin irritation are likely to cause similar adverse effects.
Rule 13: If a molecule incorporates a functional group notorious for causing respiratory problems, it's more likely to cause similar adverse effects.
Rule 14: Should a molecule contain multiple functional groups known to cause adverse effects, they're also likely to cause similar effects in different situations.
Rule 15: Molecules with functional groups like an amide group or carboxylic acid group are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom, adverse effects will likely be observed.
Rule 17: The presence of a nitrogen atom within a molecule could lead to adverse effects.
