Rule 1: Molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) tend to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) frequently cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I), it increases the chance of adverse effects.
Rule 4: Molecules with the functional group known for causing adverse effects such as a sulfonamide group can result in adverse effects like allergic reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, etc.
Rule 5: Likely adverse effects can be predicted irrespective of the molecule's structure if it contains a dangerous functional group.
Rule 6: Molecules with multiple functional groups (like sulfonamide and nitro group) associated with harmful effects increase the possibilities of causing negative health impacts.
Rule 7: The presence of a benzimidazole group in a molecule, known for toxicity, can lead to adverse effects.
Rule 8: The presence of a functional group like -N=C=N- can cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: Toxic function groups like -F or -COOH in a molecule can cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: Molecules containing a phosphorus atom, chlorine atom, or nitrogen atom are more likely to cause adverse effects due to the high reactivity of these elements.
Rule 11: Molecules containing a functional group such as a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) are more likely to cause harmful effects.
Rule 12: Molecules containing benzene rings could lead to adverse health impacts.
Rule 13: Molecules with a high molecular weight or a complex structure with multiple functional groups often cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure in molecules often cause harmful effects.
Rule 15: Molecules containing the functional group [C-]#N.[C-]#N.[C-]#N.[C-]#N.[C-]#N.[C-]#N.[C-]#N.[Fe+2] are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: If a molecule contains a hydroxyl group, it increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds with biological molecules.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains functional groups known to cause adverse effects such as injury, poisoning, or procedural complications, then it is likely to have adverse effects. This includes molecules with toxic functional groups.
Rule 2: Molecules with multiple functional groups that are known to be harmful, exponentially increase the possibility of adverse effects.
Rule 3: Specific functional groups such as a carbonyl group (C=O), a nitro group (-NO2),  chlorinated atoms (-Cl, -Br, -I), or a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I) increase the chance of the molecule causing adverse effects. Notably, carbonyl groups are related to injury, poisoning, and procedural complications.
Rule 4: The presence of a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), or a tertiary amine group (-N(CH3)3+), or polar functional groups generally increases the likelihood of adverse effects.
Rule 5: Molecules with high lipophilicity (highly hydrophobic) or high molecular weight (complex structures) are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: Functional groups such as a sulfonamide group are usually implicated in adverse effects, depending on their toxicity level, they can lead to different conditions such as allergic reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis.
Rule 7: Molecules characterized by high reactivity usually manifest adverse effects. For instance, a hydroxyl group (-OH) or a polycyclic structure can trigger adverse effects.  
Rule 8: Highly reactive molecules capable of forming covalent bonds (e.g., hydroxyl group -OH) also increase the likelihood of a molecule causing an adverse effect.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a nitro group or a halogen atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects than a molecule without these groups.
Rule 10: Molecules with benzene rings tend to create adverse effects due to their abilities to interact with other biological molecules and cause toxicity.  
Rule 11: Accessibility of functional groups like a sulfonamide group creates a higher likelihood of adverse effects. 
Rule 12: Molecules with a high polar surface area are more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 13: Reactive functional groups such as hydroxyl groups can cause adverse effects such as liver damage and skin irritation.
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group known to cause adverse effects such as injury, poisoning, or procedural complications, then it is likely to cause adverse effects. An example of this would be a sulfonamide group which is known to cause allergic reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. 

Rule 2: If the molecule includes a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, but the specific type or nature of the adverse effect is unknown, then that molecule is still likely to cause adverse effects. For instance, if the molecule has a nitro group, it is known to cause methemoglobinemia, even though the specific adverse effect may not be known.

Rule 3: If the molecule possesses multiple functional groups known to cause adverse effects, then it becomes increasingly likely to cause these effects. For example, if a molecule contained both a sulfonamide group and a nitro group, it would be more probable to induce adverse effects.
