Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule has a high lipophilicity, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule has a high molecular weight, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a functional group known to cause adverse effects, such as a nitro group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If the molecule contains a polar functional group, such as an amino group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a ring structure, such as a benzene ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a functional group causing adverse effects, such as a phosphate group (P(=O)(O)[O-]), it is likely to cause adverse effects relating to social circumstances.
Rule 10: The presence of a sodium ion ([Na+]) in a molecule indicates it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: The presence of multiple functional groups in a molecule, such as both a carbonyl group and a nitro group, increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 12: The molecular structure, including the number and position of functional groups, can impact its potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule indicates it is likely to cause adverse effects related to social circumstances.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl), it is liable to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (for instance fluorine, chlorine, or bromine), it is more probable to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a functional group known to cause adverse effects, such as a nitro group, high lipophilicity, or high molecular weight, it is predicted to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5), it is likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 7: If the molecule contains a functional group known to cause adverse effects, such as a sulfonamide group, nitro group, or halogen group, there is increased risk of adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a ring structure like a benzene ring or a polar functional group, like an alcohol group or a carboxylic acid group, it may result in adverse effects.
Rule 9: If the molecule contains a hydroxyl group (-OH), it increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 10: A molecule is less likely to cause adverse effects if it contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a chlorine atom.
Rule 1: Molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules that include a chlorine atom (-Cl) are anticipated to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules holding a carbonyl group (-C=O) may likely cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: Molecules with a functional group known to cause adverse effects are probable to trigger adverse effects.
Rule 5: Molecules containing a polar functional group, such as an amino group, can potentially cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: Molecules with a ring structure, like a benzene ring, are expected to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: Molecules that comprise a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) are suspected of causing adverse effects.
Rule 8: Molecules containing a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I) are also probable to cause adverse effects. Please note that these rules are not definitive and there may be exceptions. For confident results, it is always recommended to consult with a qualified chemist before making any decisions based on these rules.
