Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains a hydroxyl group (-OH), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
