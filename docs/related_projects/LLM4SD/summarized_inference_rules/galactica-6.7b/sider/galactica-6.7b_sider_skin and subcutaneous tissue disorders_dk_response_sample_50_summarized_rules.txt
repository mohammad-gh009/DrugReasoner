Rule 1: Molecules with a functional group such as a carbonyl group (C=O), a nitro group (-NO2), or a chlorine atom (Cl) are more likely to cause skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 2: Molecules with functional groups that are known to cause skin and other adverse effects have a higher probability of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. 
Rule 3: Molecules with sulfonamide or nitro functional groups tend to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: Molecules containing a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) are likely to result in adverse skin and subcutaneous tissue effects.
Rule 5: Molecules with functional groups like amides, esters, or aldehydes that are associated with skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: Molecules with high lipophilicity (i.e., high solubility in nonpolar solvents) or high polarity (high solubility in polar solvents) can potentially cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: Molecules comprising functional groups like amide, imide, urea, or a halogenated aromatic ring, or a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure have higher chances of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 8: Molecules with a functional group known to cause specific disorders like skin, eye, or respiratory disorders are highly likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: High molecular weight molecules, especially those with high lipophilicity (hydrophobicity), tend to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: Molecules with polar functional groups or ring structures are potential causes of adverse effects.
Rule 1: Molecules that contain a nitro group (-NO2) are likely to cause adverse effects related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 2: Molecules that contain a fluorine atom (-F) are likely to cause adverse effects related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 3: Molecules that contain a carbonyl group (-C=O) are likely to cause adverse effects related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause gastrointestinal disorders, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause respiratory disorders, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.

Rule 13: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 14: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause other adverse effects, it is likely to cause skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders as well.
Rule 15: If a molecule contains multiple functional groups that are known to cause adverse effects, it is likely to cause skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders as well.
Rule 16: Molecules that contain a high molecular weight are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: Molecules that contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) are likely to cause adverse effects related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 18: Molecules that contain a nitrogen atom are likely to cause adverse effects related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 19: Molecules that contain a sulfonamide group, known to cause gastrointestinal or respiratory disorders, are likely to cause adverse effects.
