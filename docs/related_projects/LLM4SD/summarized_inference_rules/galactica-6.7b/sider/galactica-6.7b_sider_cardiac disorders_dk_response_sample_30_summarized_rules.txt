1. Rule 1: Certain chemical groupings within a molecule, such as a Nitro group (-NO2), are more likely to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
2. Rule 2: Molecules with a Halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) present are also likely to cause these disturbances.
3. Rule 3: Molecules containing a Carbonyl group (-C=O) indicate a higher likelihood of causing adverse cardiac effects.
4. Rule 4: Molecules with a Carboxylic Acid group (-COOH) tend to have a higher likelihood of causing cardiac-related adverse effects.
5. Rule 5: The presence of a Benzene ring (C6H5) within a molecule's structure suggests a heightened risk of contributing to adverse cardiac conditions.
6. Rule 6: Recently some evidence suggests that even the presence of a fluorine atom, which is a type of Halogen atom, within a molecule can increase its probability of causing adverse effects.
7. Rule 7: The lesser-known Hydroxyl group (-OH) within a molecule's structure is found to increase the likelihood of adverse effects.
8. Rule 8: Even the presence of a sulfur atom (-S) in a molecule's structure has been associated with a higher risk of causing adverse effects.
9. Rule 9: Strong indicators such as the presence of metal ions, nitrogen atoms, arsenic and gadolinium atoms, carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen double bonds have been shown to potentially cause adverse effects.
10. Rule 10: Chemical structures like a Halogenated Aromatic Ring makes a molecule more likely to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
11. Rule 11: Manganese ions (Mn2+) in a molecule could increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Please note that these are general rules inferred from extensive data, they might not apply conclusively to every single molecule as there may be exceptions. It is always recommended to further test any molecule in a laboratory setting.
