Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a functional group such as an alcohol, it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a halogenated aromatic ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to neurological disorders.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to skin and eye irritation.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains an amide, it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 9: If a molecule has a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects on the respiratory system.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a functional group known to cause adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system, such as sulfonamide group, it is likely to cause these effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects on both the gastrointestinal system and the central nervous system, such as a combination of a sulfonamide and a benzodiazepine group, it is likely to cause these effects. 
Rule 12: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects on the central nervous system, such as a benzodiazepine group, it is likely to cause these effects.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it increases the likelihood of causing gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 2: The presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) in a molecule can potentially cause gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 3: The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) in a molecule increases the chances of causing gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (like fluorine, chlorine, or bromine), it potentially triggers gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 6: A molecule containing a nitrogen atom is more prone to causing adverse gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 7: The presence of an amide or ester group in a molecule escalates the possibility of gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a halogen atom, it is at risk of causing skin and eye irritation.
Rule 9: If a molecule incorporates a nitro group (-NO2), it stands a chance of causing respiratory disorders.
Rule 10: Halogen atoms can potentially cause adverse effects related to skin and eye irritation.
Rule 11: Nitro groups potentially cause respiratory disorders.
Rule 12: Presence of the amidine group (-C(=NH)=NH-) or sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in a molecule have implications for gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 13: Molecules containing an amide, imide, or urea group, halogenated aromatic ring or a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure may cause gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory disorders, and genotoxicity and carcinogenicity respectively.
