Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as a carbonyl group (C=O), halogen atom like fluorine, chlorine, or bromine, or a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule is a strong indicator of its potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) or benzodiazepine group in the molecule is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of a sulfonamide, amidine or carbamate group in a molecule is likely to cause adverse effects in the kidneys and urinary system, liver or nervous system respectively.
Rule 5: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) or halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 7: The presence of a cyclic structure in the molecule is likely to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 8: The presence of a chlorine atom in the molecule is likely to cause adverse effects related to dermatological disorders.
Rule 9: The molecule has a metal ion such as gallium, it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. 
Rule 10: The presence of a benzene ring in a molecule is likely to cause adverse effects related to neurological disorders.
Rule 1: Molecules that contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will probably cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. 
Rule 2: Molecules that contain a phosphate group (-PO4) are prone to cause adverse effects associated with renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 3: Molecules with a tertiary amine group (-N(CH3)3) are likely to lead to adverse effects connected with renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 4: Existence of a nitro group in a molecule is suggestive of causing adverse effects related to respiratory disorders.
Rule 5: The presence of a chlorine atom in molecules is indicative of causing adverse effects related to skin and eye irritation.
Rule 6: Molecules with a carbonyl group (C=O) pose a higher risk of causing adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 7: Molecules containing a halogenated aromatic ring are more likely to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 8: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule indicates its potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 9: Molecules containing a sulfonamide functional group are likely to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 10: Molecules with a halogen atom suggest its potential to cause adverse effects related to dermatological disorders.
Rule 11: Molecules with functional components such as amidine or guanidine groups are more likely to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary issues.
Rule 12: Molecules that contain a halogenated aromatic ring have a higher chance of causing adverse effects related to neurological disorders.
Rule 13: Presence of a nitro group in a molecule can imply potential adverse effects related to respiratory disorders.
Rule 14: Presence of carbonyl group (C=O) or a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule suggests a higher likelihood of causing renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 15: Presence of a phenyl group (C6H5) or a naphthyl group (C10H7) in a molecule suggests a higher likelihood of causing neurological disorders.
Rule 16: Nitro compounds in a molecule increases susceptibility to adverse effects on kidneys and urinary system.
Rule 17: Presence of a carboxylic acid group in a molecule increases risk of adverse effects on the kidneys and urinary system.
Rule 18: Presence of a benzene ring in a molecule increases risk of adverse effects on the kidneys and urinary system.
