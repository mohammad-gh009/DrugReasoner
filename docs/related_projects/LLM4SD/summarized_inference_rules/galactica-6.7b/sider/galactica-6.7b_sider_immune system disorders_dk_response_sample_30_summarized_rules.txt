Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, piperazine group, or a quinolone group, which are known to cause adverse effects on the immune system or central nervous system, it's likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of either a carboxylic acid group, nitro group or halogenated aromatic ring in a molecule may cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. 
Rule 3: The molecules that contain a nitro group, a chlorine atom or a carbonyl group are likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 4: A molecule is likely to cause adverse effects when it contains an aromatic ring, a polar functional group or has a sizeable molecular weight.
Rule 5:  The presence of a benzene ring in the composition of the molecule increases the probability of the molecule causing immune system disorders.
Rule 6: Molecules containing a sulfonamide group, a quinolone group, or a benzimidazole group pose the risk of causing adverse effects due to their known harmful effects on immune, nervous or skin systems.
Rule 7: If the molecule has a carboxylic acid group, a nitro group or a halogen atom, it is likely to cause adverse effects on the immune system.
Rule 8: Adverse effects related to immune system disorders are likely caused by molecules containing a functional group that directly impacts the immune system, nervous system, or both, such as sulfonamide, carbamate, or phenol groups respectively.
Rule 9: If the molecule has a high molecular weight or contains a polar functional group or aromatic ring, there is a higher risk of its causing adverse effects.
Rule 10: A molecule with a functional group known to cause adverse effects like immune system disorders or skin and eye irritation, such as a nitro group, a halogen atom, or a carbonyl group, is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a nitro group, a chlorine atom or a sulfur atom, it's likely to cause immune system disorders.
Rule 12: The presence of a halogenated aromatic ring, amide or carboxylic acid group may indicate a molecule that could cause immune system disorders.
Rule 13: The likelihood of a molecule causing adverse effects increases if it contains a nitro group, a carboxylic acid group, or a benzene ring.
Rule 14: Molecules involving maleic anhydride group, piperazine group, or sulfonamide group, known for their adverse effects, may impact immune, nervous or reproductive systems respectively, causing potential harm.
Rule 15: High molecular weight molecules combined with high amounts of either aromatic rings or polar functional groups are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: The presence of a carboxylic acid group, nitro group, or halogenated aromatic ring may indicate potential adverse effects related to immune system disorders.
Rule 1: The presence of an aromatic ring in a molecule makes it more likely to cause adverse effects due to its stability and potential to interact with other molecules.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a polar functional group are more likely to instigate adverse effects as they can interact with water and other molecules.
Rule 3: Molecules with charged groups also have a greater likelihood of causing adverse effects because they can interact with water and other molecules.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, known to cause adverse effects on the immune system, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: Molecules containing a metal ion, such as platinum, are prone to triggering adverse effects.
Rule 6: Functional groups like carbamate groups, known to cause adverse effects on the nervous system, when present in a molecule, increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 7: The existence of a piperazine group can cause adverse effects on the central nervous system.
Rule 8: A benzimidazole group can cause adverse effects on both the immune system and the central nervous system.
Rule 9: The presence of a chlorobenzene group in a molecule can cause adverse effects on the skin.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), there is a high likelihood it will cause adverse effects associated with immune system disorders.
Rule 11: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases the chance of it causing adverse effects associated with immune system disorders.
Rule 12: Molecules containing a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I) could potentially cause adverse effects associated with immune system disorders.
Rule 13: The presence of an estrogenic group in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects on the reproductive system.
Rule 14: A benzothiazole group in a molecule heightens the risk of causing adverse effects on the skin.
Rule 15: A quinolone group in a molecule can trigger adverse effects on the lungs, kidneys, heart, or blood.
Rule 16: Molecules containing a nitro group can potentially cause adverse effects on the liver. 
Note: These rules while helpful, are not absolute and exceptions might exist. It is advised to consult with a qualified chemist for a more accurate conclusion.
