Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it's likely to cause adverse effects related to infections and infestations.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it's likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects (such as infections, infestations, skin irritation, liver damage), makes it likely for the molecule to cause similar effects.
Rule 5: A chlorine atom in the molecule indicates a likely cause of adverse effects related to infections and infestations.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains an amidine group (-C=NH-), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), or a functional group known to cause adverse effects, the molecule likely causes adverse effects.
Rule 7: If the molecule contains any functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, amides, or carboxylic acids, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: If the molecule has a high lipophilicity or high molecular weight, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If the molecule contains a functional group that causes skin or respiratory problems, it is likely to cause similar effects in humans.
Rule 10: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) or nitrogen atom in a molecule suggests that it can cause adverse effects related to infections and infestations.
Rule 11: If the molecule contains both a nitro group (-NO2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it's likely to cause adverse effects related to infections and infestations.
Rule 12: The presence of a phenyl group (C6H5), in a molecule, suggests it can cause adverse effects related to infections and infestations.
Rule 13: If the molecule contains both a nitro group (-NO2) and a chlorine atom (Cl), it is likely to cause adverse effects, particularly those related to infections, infestations, and unrelated irritations as well.
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (including fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine), it tends to cause more adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: Molecules having a nitro group (-NO2) are expected to cause adverse effects related to infections and infestations.
Rule 5: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it is likely to cause adverse effects relating to infections and infestations.
Rule 6: The presence of a functional group known to induce effects such as infections, infestations, skin irritation, or respiratory problems, raises the propensity for the molecule to cause similar adverse effects in humans.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains both a nitro group and a carboxylic acid group, it is likely to have side effects relating to infections and infestations.
Note: The functional groups in a molecule decreases or increases the likelihood of side effects. Although these rules can serve as a guide, they are not definitive and it is recommended to consult with a certified chemist before drawing any conclusion based on these rules.
