Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects due to interactions with biological molecules such as proteins and enzymes.
Rule 2: The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects due to reactions with biological molecules such as proteins and enzymes.
Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects due to interactions with biological molecules such as proteins and enzymes.
Rule 4: The presence of a benzene ring (C6H5) in a molecule may lead to adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
Rule 5: The presence of a functional group or a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse cardiovascular effects.
Rule 6: The presence of a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) elevates the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure, it is more likely to induce adverse effects.
Rule 8: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse cardiovascular effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
Rule 10: The presence of a sodium ion (Na+) functional group in a molecule is a significant indicator of its potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
Rule 11: A phosphate group (-PO3H2) present in a molecule signifies a likelihood of causing cardiac-related adverse effects.
Rule 12: The presence of halogenated aromatic ring structure in a molecule can increase its potential to cause adverse cardiac effects.
Rule 13: The presence of hydroxyl groups (-OH) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects as these groups can cause toxicity via interaction with biological structures.
Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases the risk of adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, likely due to the group's interaction with blood vessels leading to increased blood pressure and heart rate, as well as potential decreased oxygen delivery.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders due to its potential to react with other molecules in the body.
Rule 3: The presence of a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases the risk of adverse effects on the cardiovascular system as these atoms can interact with blood vessels and cause an increase in blood pressure and heart rate.
Rule 4: When a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it increases the risk of adverse effects on the cardiovascular system due to its potential to react with other molecules.
Rule 5: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in a molecule might cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a phenyl group (C6H5), it may potentially cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
Rule 7: Molecules containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) might lead to an increased likelihood of adverse effects.
Rule 8: The potential toxicity of molecules containing functional groups such as a nitro, carbonyl, halogen atom, or carboxylic acid group is not definitive and may not apply to all cases thus should always be consulted with a qualified chemist.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure, or a halogenated aromatic structure, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
Rule 10: Molecules with functional groups like a sulfur atom (-S), a metal ion (e.g., Zn2+, Fe3+, Cu2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ or K+), a phosphorus atom (-P), a selenium atom (-Se), or a nitrogen atom (-N) could possibly cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
