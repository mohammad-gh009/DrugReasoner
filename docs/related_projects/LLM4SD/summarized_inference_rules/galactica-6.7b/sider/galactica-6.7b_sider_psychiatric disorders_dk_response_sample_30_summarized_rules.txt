Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine) or specifically a chlorine atom (-Cl), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, it's likely to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it might cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a phenyl group (C6H5), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. 
Rule 7: The presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) in a molecule is associated with adverse effects in psychiatric disorders.
Rule 8: If the molecule contains certain functional groups such as a nitro group, a halogen atom, or a carbonyl group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects regardless of these effects being related to psychiatric disorders or not. This is due to their reactivity and potential to interact destructively with other biological molecules such as proteins and enzymes.
Rule 9: These rules depend on the analysis of given data and may have exceptions based on other molecular features. Hence, it's always recommended to seek a professional chemist's advice for a comprehensive understanding.
Rule 1: A molecule will likely cause adverse effects in psychiatric disorders if it contains a functional group known to impact the central nervous system, like an N-methyl group.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a nitro group (-NO2) has a high likelihood of causing psychiatric disorder-related adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with a chlorine atom (-Cl) are likely to induce adverse effects associated with psychiatric disorders.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it tends to cause adverse effects in psychiatric disorders.
