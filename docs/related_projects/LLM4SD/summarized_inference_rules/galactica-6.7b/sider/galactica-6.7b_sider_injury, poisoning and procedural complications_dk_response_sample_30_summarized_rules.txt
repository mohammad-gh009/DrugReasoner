Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to injury, poisoning, and procedural complications.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to injury, poisoning, and procedural complications.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to injury, poisoning, and procedural complications.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains both a nitro group (-NO2) and a chlorine atom (-Cl), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to injury, poisoning, and procedural complications.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine), it is likely to cause adverse effects such as skin irritation, respiratory problems, and nervous system damage.
Rule 6: If the molecule contains a functional group such as an amidine or guanidine group, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to injury, poisoning, and procedural complications.
Rule 7: If the molecule contains a halogenated aromatic ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to injury, poisoning, and procedural complications.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, such as a sulfonamide group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a polar functional group, such as an amino group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: If the molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects such as injury, poisoning, or procedural complications, for example, a chlorine atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If the molecule contains a functional group that is known to be toxic, for example, a benzene ring, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: If the molecule contains multiple functional groups that are known to cause adverse effects, for example, a chlorine atom and a benzene ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects.  
Rule 13: If the molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects such as a sulfonamide group, it is likely to cause adverse effects due to its ability to block the action of certain enzymes in the body.
Rule 14: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), a carbonyl group (-C=O), and a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to injury, poisoning, and procedural complications.
Rule 15: If a molecule contains a large number of atoms or rings, it is more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 16: If the molecule contains a metal ion, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: If a molecule contains a ring structure, such as a benzene ring, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: Molecules with a carbonyl group (C=O) are more likely to cause adverse effects due to possible interactions with biological molecules leading to cell damage.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a nitrogen atom are less likely to cause adverse effects because they form strong bonds with other atoms, reducing their likelihood to interact with biological molecules.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a halogen atom (e.g. fluorine, chlorine) are less likely to cause adverse effects due to their weak bonds with biological molecules, reducing likelihood of interactions.
Rule 4: Molecules with a nitro group (-NO2) are more likely to cause adverse effects, particularly related to injury, poisoning and procedural complications.
Rule 5: Molecules with a sulfonamide group are likely to cause adverse effects including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms.
Rule 6: Molecules with a nitro group may cause adverse effects like nausea, vomiting, and dizziness even without any other functional group.
Rule 7: Molecules containing both a sulfonamide group and a nitro group are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: Molecules with polar functional group such as an amino group (-NH2), hydroxyl group (-OH), or carbonyl group (-C=O) are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: Molecules possessing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure or a halogenated aromatic structure have higher potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: Molecules with alcohol or amine functional groups are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a cyclic structure, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: Molecules containing functional groups like alcohols, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 13: Molecules with high molecular weight or high polarity increase the likelihood of adverse effects.
Rule 14: Molecules containing heavy metals such as lead, mercury, or cadmium, are more likely to cause adverse effects.
