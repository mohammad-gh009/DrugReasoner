Rule 1: Molecules containing certain functional groups or substructures, such as a nitro group (-NO2) or a benzene ring indicate potential to cause adverse effects due to their interaction with biological molecules.

Rule 2: Larger molecules with higher lipophilicity are more likely to cause adverse effects due to their ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets.

Rule 3: Molecules with a chiral center can have different biological activities and molecule interactions causing potential adverse effects.

Rule 4: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (C=O) likely cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders.

Rule 5: Molecules with a halogenated aromatic ring indicate potential to cause metabolism and nutrition disorders related adverse effects. 

Rule  6: Molecules containing a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) more likely cause metabolism and nutrition disorders related adverse effects.

Rule 7: The presence of a functional group such as a carbonyl group (C=O) or a hydroxyl group (-OH) increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 8: Molecules containing a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure are more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 9: The presence of a metal ion such as platinum (Pt) or zinc (Zn) in a molecule heightens the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.

Rule 10: Molecules containing a functional group that is associated with either metabolism and nutrition disorders, or toxicity, poses a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 11: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2), a carbonyl group (-C=O), or a hydroxyl group (-OH) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.

Rule 12: The presence of a halogen atom in a molecule, for example, fluorine, chlorine, bromine increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects. 

Rule 13: The molecular formula of a molecule, for instance, the degree of unsaturation, influences its potential to cause adverse effects. 

Rule 14: Molecules containing a nitrogen atom, a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I), or a metal ion (such as gadolinium or silver) are likely to cause adverse effects. 

Rule 15: Molecules containing a phosphate group (PO4) are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule signifies a high probability of it causing adverse effects due to its reactivity and potential interaction with biological molecules.
Rule 2: The presence of a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule elevates the likelihood of it causing adverse effects as these atoms can form covalent bonds leading to toxicity.
Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule boosts the likelihood of causing adverse effects given its reactivity and ability to form covalent bonds with biological molecules.
Rule 4: Molecules containing functional groups, such as aldehydes, ketones, amides, or carboxylic acids, are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: Molecules with high lipophilicity are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: Molecules with high molecular weight are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: The presence in a molecule of a functional group that is associated with metabolism and nutrition disorders implies it can cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: The presence in a molecule of a functional group that is associated with drug-drug interactions signifies it can cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: The presence in a molecule of a functional group that is associated with genotoxicity signifies it can cause adverse effects. 
Rule 10: If a molecule contains functional groups such as a carbonyl group (C=O) or a hydroxyl group (-OH), there is a high chance for it to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders.
Rule 11: If a molecule has a significant molecular weight or a complex structure, it carries higher chances for causing adverse effects.
Rule 12: If a molecule contains any functional groups that are associated with toxicity, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: A molecule containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) has a higher potential to cause adverse effects due to its reactivity and potential to form toxic metabolites.
Rule 2: Molecules with a nitro group (-NO2) are also prone to cause adverse effects, as they can lead to formation of free radicals and oxidative stress.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and lipophilicity of a molecule significantly factor in its potential impact, with high molecular weight, high lipophilicity molecules more likely to breach cell membranes and cause toxicity.
Rule 4: Some functional groups, like hydroxyl (-OH), can limit adverse effects by improving water-solubility and reducing the molecule's polarity.
Rule 5: The stereochemistry of the molecule is influential, as different biological activities can arise from different chiral center configurations.
Rule 6: Presence of certain metals in a molecule such as calcium (Ca2+) and gadolinium (Gd3+) can affect its potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: The potential of a molecule to cause adverse effects can be indicated by the presence of certain functional groups or substructures. For instance, the presence of a lactone functional group signifies potential toxicity.
