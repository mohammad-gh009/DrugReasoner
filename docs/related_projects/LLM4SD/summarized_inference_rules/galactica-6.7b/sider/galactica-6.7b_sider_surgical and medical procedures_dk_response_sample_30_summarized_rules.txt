Rule 1: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) are more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 2: Molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) are more likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 3: Molecules containing a halogen atom (like fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: Molecules with a high lipophilicity are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: Molecules with a high molecular weight are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a functional group known to cause adverse effects (such as a sulfonamide group), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: Molecules containing a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) are likely to cause adverse effects related to surgical and medical procedures.
Rule 8: Molecules containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) are likely to cause adverse effects related to surgical and medical procedures.
Rule 9: Molecules containing a tertiary amine group (-N(CH3)3) are likely to cause adverse effects related to surgical and medical procedures.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects during surgical and medical procedures, it will likely cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: Molecules containing a polar functional group are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: Molecules containing a hydrophobic functional group are less likely to cause adverse effects as compared to molecules with polar or hydrophilic functional groups.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a functional group or a metal ion that is known to cause adverse effects during surgical and medical procedures, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: Molecules containing a benzene ring are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, such as in surgical and medical procedures, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 16: If a molecule contains a metal ion known to cause adverse effects during surgical and medical procedures, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: If a molecule contains a functional group like a carbonyl or hydroxyl group (-OH), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 18: If a molecule contains a metal ion like platinum (Pt) or mercury (Hg), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 19: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) are likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 20: Molecules containing an alcohol group are likely to cause adverse effects related to surgical and medical procedures.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules that contain a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) are prone to causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it has a higher chance of leading to adverse effects.
