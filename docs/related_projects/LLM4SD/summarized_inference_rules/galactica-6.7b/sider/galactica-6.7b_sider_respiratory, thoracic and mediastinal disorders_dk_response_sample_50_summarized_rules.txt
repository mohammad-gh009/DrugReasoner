Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) or a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders.

Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogenated aromatic ring or a halogen atom (such as Fluorine, Chlorine, or Bromine), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders.

Rule 3: If the molecule contains a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders.

Rule 4: The presence of certain groups or atoms in a molecule, specifically a nitro group (-NO2), a carbonyl group (-C=O), or a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I) increase the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.

Rule 5: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, it less likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders. 

Rule 6: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders. 

Note: These rules are not foolproof and should be used with caution. Consultation with a qualified chemist before making decisions based on these rules is recommended.
