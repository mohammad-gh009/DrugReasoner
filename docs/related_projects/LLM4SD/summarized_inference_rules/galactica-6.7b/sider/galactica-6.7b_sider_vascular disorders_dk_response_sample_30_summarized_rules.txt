Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a hydroxyl group (-OH), it is likely to increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a phenyl group, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. 
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a halogenated aromatic ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders.
