Rule 1: Molecules containing a halogen atom are more likely to cause eye-related adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a nitro group are more likely to cause eye-related adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a carbonyl group are more likely to cause eye-related adverse effects.
Rule 4: Molecules with an aromatic ring are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: Molecules with a polar functional group are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: High molecular weight molecules are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: The presence, number, and position of functional groups in a molecule can significantly impact its potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 8: Molecules containing a functional group known to cause skin, eye, or respiratory issues are likely to cause related side effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, it is more likely to cause eye-related disorders.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause eye-related disorders.
Rule 11: Molecules containing phosphate, sulfate, or chloride groups are less likely to cause eye disorders.
Rule 12: Molecules with elements, such as bromine, fluorine, and chlorine, are less likely to cause eye disorders.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a ring structure, it is more likely to have adverse effects related to eye disorders.
Rule 14: Molecules containing a nitro group and a carbonyl group are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: If a molecule contains a functional group known to cause skin or respiratory issues, it is likely to have related side effects. 
Rule 16: Molecules containing halogenated aromatic rings or chlorine atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 17: If a molecule contains a functional group known to cause nausea, it is likely to have a side effect related to nausea. 
Rule 18: The presence of reactive functional groups like aldehydes or ketones in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
