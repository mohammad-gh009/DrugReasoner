Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects. This group can interact with biological molecules like proteins and DNA, resulting in possible damage and cell death.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is probable to cause adverse effects. Nitro groups are highly reactive and can cause oxidative stress leading to tissue damage.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it can likely cause adverse effects. Halogen atoms can disrupt protein and enzyme structures leading to potential adverse consequences. 
Rule 4: The presence of a benzene ring (C6H5) in a molecule can be an indicator of probable adverse effects.
Rule 5: Molecules with high lipophilicity or high molecular weight are likely to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 6: The presence of polar functional groups such as hydroxyl group (-OH), known to cause adverse effects, in a molecule makes it more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: The presence of a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, such as a nitro group in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of a chlorine atom in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 7: The presence of a carbonyl group in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, such as a nitro group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to be toxic, such as a benzene ring, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains multiple functional groups that are known to cause adverse effects, such as a combination of a nitro group and a benzene ring, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
