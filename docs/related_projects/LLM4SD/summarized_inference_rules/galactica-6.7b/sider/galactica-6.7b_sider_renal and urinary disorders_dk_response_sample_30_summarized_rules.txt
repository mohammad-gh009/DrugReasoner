Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), nitro group (-NO2), carbonyl group (C=O), sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), or a functional group, it may cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), chlorine atom (-Cl), functional group or halogen atom, it could lead to adverse effects related to respiratory disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl), functional group or halogen atom such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine, it's more likely to cause adverse effects related to skin and eye irritation.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it may result in adverse effects related to respiratory and cardiovascular disorders.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains halogenated aromatic ring, it might cause adverse effects related to neurological disorders.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structures or other functional groups, it might lead to adverse effects related to genotoxicity or carcinogenicity.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a functional group such sulfonamide group, this could lead to gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 8: The presence of benzene rings in a molecule may lower the probability of adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a phosphate group (-PO4), it could adversely affect renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 10: The presence of functional groups like carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid in a molecule increases its likelihood to cause adverse effects in renal and urinary systems. 
Rule 11: The presence of functional groups like carboxylic acid, nitro group or halogenated aromatic ring, it might cause neurological disorders.
Rule 12: The occurrence of a tertiary amine group in a molecule could increase chances of renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains the functional group -CN-, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 14: If the molecule contains the functional group -COOH, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory and cardiovascular disorders.
Rule 15: If the molecule contains the functional group -SCN, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to skin and eye disorders.
Rule 16: If the molecule contains a metal ion (such as copper), it may cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 17: If the molecule contains a functional group known to cause adverse effects on the kidneys and urinary system, such as a sulfonamide group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 18: If a molecule contains a functional group known to cause adverse effects on the central nervous system, such as a benzodiazepine group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 19: If a molecule contains a functional group known to cause adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, such as a quinolone group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
