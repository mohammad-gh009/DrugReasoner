Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases the risk of adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic system. 

Rule 2: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases the risk of adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic system.

Rule 3: The presence of a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases the risk of adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic system.

Rule 4: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders.

Rule 5: The presence of a halogenated aromatic ring in a molecule increases the likelihood of adverse effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders.

Rule 6: If the molecule contains a functional group like an amide group (-C=O-NH-) or carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders.

Rule 7: The presence of a functional group such as a sulfur, phosphorus, nitrogen, fluorine, bromine, iodine, or platinum atom in a molecule increases the risk of adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic system.

Rule 8: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders.

Rule 9: The presence of a functional group like carboxylic acid or carbonyl group, or a halogenated aromatic ring in a molecule, may cause adverse effects related to skin and respiratory system disorders or reproductive and developmental disorders.

Rule 10: If a molecule contains a functional group known to cause adverse effects on the central nervous system or reproductive system, it is likely to cause similar effects in humans.

Rule 11: If a molecule contains a functional group such as an amide, imide, or urea group, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders.

Rule 12: If a molecule contains a functional group such as a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause potential adverse effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl), it may cause potential adverse effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders as well as skin and respiratory system disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to result in potential adverse effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders and possibly central nervous system disorders.
Rule 4: The presence of a benzene ring (C6H5) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders.
Rule 5: Molecules with a functional group such as a carboxylic acid, hydroxyl group, amide, sulfonamide, or carbamate, are likely to cause potential adverse effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a halogenated aromatic ring or a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is likely to cause potential adverse effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders.
Rule 7: Presence of chiral center in a molecule could potentially contribute to adverse effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders.
Rule 8: If the molecule contains a phenyl group (C6H5), it is likely to cause potential adverse effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders.
Rule 9: The molecule containing a guanidinium group (CN(C)CC(C1=CC=C(C=C1)O)C2(CCCCC2)O), is suggested to be less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: Molecules containing functional groups known to cause adverse effects on the central nervous system (such as a quinolone group), the skin (like a benzimidazole group), or the blood and lymphatic system (such as a sulfonamide group), are expected to cause potential adverse effects.
