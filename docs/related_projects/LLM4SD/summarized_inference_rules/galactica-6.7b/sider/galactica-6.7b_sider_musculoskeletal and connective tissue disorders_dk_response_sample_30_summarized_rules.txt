Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it may cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it often is linked to conditions related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders or respiratory and cardiovascular disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I), it could cause musculoskeletal, connective tissue, skin, and eye disorders.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it may lead to gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 5: If the molecule contains a piperazine ring (-C4H8N2), it may cause central nervous system disorders.
Rule 6: If the molecule contains a halogenated aromatic ring, it has been linked to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders or dermatological disorders.
Rule 7: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5), it could cause respiratory or neurological disorders.
Rule 8: If the molecule contains a functional group such as a carboxylic acid, nitro group, or sulfonamide, it often leads to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 9: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl), it may lead to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders or respiratory disorders.
Rule 10: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it may cause musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 11: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group, it may cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 12: If the molecule contains a tertiary amine group (-N(CH3)3), it may cause cardiovascular disorders.
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is likely to lead to adverse effects associated with musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This is because carboxylic acid groups commonly interact with collagen, a protein found in connective tissue, causing tissue damage and inflammation.

Rule 2: The presence of a nitro group in a molecule tends to cause adverse effects related to cardiovascular disorders or respiratory disorders. Nitro groups can interact with blood vessels, inducing constriction, high blood pressure, and other cardiovascular issues.

Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogenated aromatic ring, it can cause either neurological disorders or dermatological disorders. Halogenated aromatic rings can interact with neurotransmitters in the brain, leading to mood and behavior changes.
