Rule 1: The presence of a polar functional group, such as an amide or ester, in the molecule is a determinant to whether FDA grants its approval.
Rule 2: The molecular weight and lipophilicity of the molecule play crucial roles in determining its permissibility in crossing the blood-brain barrier and reaching the target site.
Rule 3: The presence of a flexible ring structure in the molecule can lead to toxicity-related issues during clinical trials.
Rule 4: Molecules with ring structures are more likely to be stable and less toxic, hence preferred for drug development.
Rule 5: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule is an influential factor due to its potential to cause toxicity after failing clinical trials.
Rule 6: Carbonyl groups in a molecule increase the likelihood of toxicity and resultantly failing clinical trials.
Rule 7: The presence of a polar functional group (such as an amino group) in the molecule increases its ability to interact with biological molecules, thus increasing its chance of receiving FDA approval.
Rule 8: The presence of a cyclic structure in the molecule increases the molecule's stability and likelihood of approval.
Rule 9: A molecule with a high molecular weight and low lipophilicity is less likely to penetrate biological membranes, making it less likely to receive FDA approval due to toxicity potential.
Rule 10: Polar functional groups such as an amino group or a hydroxyl group in a molecule can make it more soluble, potentially improving its absorption through the bodily tract.
Rule 11: Hydrophobic regions, such as a long chain of carbon atoms in a molecule, can increase likelihood of the molecule to cross cell membranes and increase the drug's efficacy.
Rule 12: The presence of a flexible ring structure, such as a cyclopropyl group, can increase a molecule's conformational flexibility and likelihood of engaging multiple bodily targets, improving efficacy.
