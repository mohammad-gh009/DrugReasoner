Rule 1: The presence of a polar functional group such as an amide, ester, amino group (-NH2), hydroxyl group (-OH), ammonium ion, or alcohol in a molecule increases its likelihood of being approved by the FDA, as these groups can interact with biological molecules, improving drug efficacy and solubility in water.

Rule 2: The presence of hydrophobic groups such as a long chain of carbon atoms, phenyl ring, naphthyl ring, long chain hydrocarbon, or cyclic peptide in the molecule decreases the likelihood of FDA approval due to potential toxicity and side effects. These groups can cause the molecule to accumulate in tissues or increase the molecule's hydrophobicity, making it more toxic to biological systems.

Rule 3: The presence of a rigid or flexible ring system or structure in the molecule contributes variably to its approval, as this aspect can either enhance the drug's efficacy or increase its toxicity. Shapes such as a benzene ring, polycyclic structure, cyclopropyl group (-C3H5), cyclobutyl group (-C4H8), cyclopentane, cyclohexane ring, cyclopropane, cyclobutane, or a conjugated system can lead to improved efficacy by providing stability, reducing reactivity, or aiding in better protein binding. However, overly ringed or flexible molecules can increase the risk of toxicity due to off-target effects.

Rule 4: The molecular weight and lipophilicity of the molecule are crucial factors in FDA approval. Molecules with a lower molecular weight (between 150-500Da) and higher lipophilicity are more usually absorbed and distributed better, potentially leading to more successful drug efficacy. However, a high molecular weight, lower lipophilicity or a higher lipophilicity in certain cases, may hamper cell membrane penetration, cause poor absorption, distribution, or even toxicity, affecting the drugâ€™s overall efficacy and safety.


Rule 5: The chemical stability of the molecule in biological systems also plays a role in FDA approval. Molecules with a stable structure, not prone to degradation or metabolism in the body, are generally more likely to be approved.

Rule 6: Certain functional groups like carbonyl (-C=O) and carboxylic acid (-COOH) can either increase or decrease the likelihood of approval due to potential interactive or disruptive impacts on cellular processes, and therefore must be considered carefully.

Rule 7: Lastly, advanced techniques like machine learning algorithms, molecular modelling, simulations, and computational chemistry are being constantly employed to predict molecular behaviour, toxicity, and potential side effects. However, these methods are often experimental, time-consuming, and expensive.
Rule 1: The presence of a polar functional group (such as an amide, urea group, amino group, hydroxyl group, ammonium ion, carboxylic acid group or an ester) in the molecule increases its chance of getting approved by FDA.

Rule 2: The presence of hydrophobic regions or groups (like a long chain of carbon atoms or a phenyl ring) in the molecule decreases its chance of FDA approval due to potential toxicity and side effects.

Rule 3: The molecular weight of the molecule should be between 100-500 Da. Molecules with high molecular weight or high polarity may not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, reducing efficacy. 

Rule 4: Molecules with a stable structure and no reactive functional groups are more likely to get approved by FDA. Reactive functional groups include aldehydes, ketones, or imines which are known to cause toxicity in humans. 

Rule 5: The molecule should have suitable molecular weight and lipophilicity to cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the target site.

Rule 6: Molecules with appropriate drug-like properties such as solubility, permeability, and a good pharmacokinetic profile are more likely to be FDA approved. 

Rule 7: Molecules with a flexible ring structure may have better binding affinity with target proteins, potentially increasing chances of FDA approval. 

Rule 8: The presence of certain functional groups that are associated with increased efficacy and decreased toxicity might increase the approval of the drug. These groups include a carboxylic acid group, which enhances the solubility and permeability of drugs. 

Rule 9: The molecule's structure should have the potential to bind to specific receptors or enzymes to increase its chances of approval. 

Rule 10: The molecule should have a good absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profile to increase its chances of approval. 

Rule 11: The molecule should not contain toxic functional groups such as epoxides or halogen.

Rule 12: The structure should not contain a nitrogen atom due to potential toxicity issues. 

Rule 13: Molecules with a simple structure have an increased chance of getting approved by FDA.

Rule 14: Molecules with flexible or rigid structures may impact its ability to penetrate the cell membrane and reach its target site, which could impact its efficacy and safety, thus affecting its chances of approval. 

Rule 15: The presence of a ring in the molecule (e.g. benzene ring or a flexible ring system) affects the chances of approval. Some ring structures may improve the drug's chance of approval, while others may hinder due to potential toxicity concerns. 

Rule 16: Molecules with high lipophilicity may have poor absorption and distribution in the body, leading to low efficacy and toxicity. Balancing the molecular weight and lipophilicity of the molecule is of utmost importance to ensure optimal efficacy and safety.
