Rule 1: The molecule must have a structure that allows for the formation of a stable benzene ring, achievable via a structure that contains at least one benzene ring or can be converted into a benzene ring through a series of chemical reactions.
Rule 2: The molecule must also have a structure that allows for the formation of a stable biphenyl ring, achievable via a structure that contains at least two benzene rings connected by a single bond or can be converted into a biphenyl ring through a series of chemical reactions.
Rule 3: The structure of the molecule should also allow for the formation of a stable benzophenone ring, achievable by having a structure that contains a benzene ring and a carbonyl group connected by a single bond or a structure that can be converted into a benzophenone ring through a series of chemical reactions.
Rule 4: The magnitude and sensitivity of double bonds in molecular architecture influence their ability to form pi bonds.
Rule 5: Presence of polar functional groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones can increase the polarity of a molecule, making it more likely to engage with other molecules.
Rule 6: Based on number and location, functional groups such as hydroxyl, amino, and halogen groups in the molecule can influence its candidacy to be BBBP.
Rule 7: The molecule must contain a benzene ring and a polar functional group (like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid) at the para, meta, or ortho position on the ring.
Rule 8: Presence of a nitrogen atom between two carbon atoms of a molecule is essential for predicting whether a molecule can be BBBP.
Rule 9: Rules indicate that a molecule is less likely to be BBBP if a carbonyl group (functional with formula COCH3) exists between the two carbon atoms of a pi bond.
Rule 10: To be BBBP, a molecule should have a flexible chain that can accommodate the curvature of the benzene ring.
Rule 11: Molecule must have a benzene ring and a carbonyl group allowing it to form a BBBP smiles string.
Rule 12: The molecule adapts the BBBP smiles string by having a carboxylic acid group and a nitrogen atom in its structure.
Rule 13: Ability of the molecule to bind to BBBP receptor relies on number, position, or presence of halogens (like chlorine).
Rule 14: Molecule must have a polar functional group such as an alcohol or a carboxylic acid that can form hydrogen bonds with other molecules like water does.
Rule 15: Molecule should also have a high boiling point due to the presence of multiple polar functional groups.
Rule 16: A molecule should have a low melting point due to the presence of multiple polar functional groups.
Rule 17: Presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule is essential for BBBP.
Rule 18: It must have a linear structure with alternating single and double bonds.
Rule 19: The molecule should have a hydrophobic region that is surrounded by hydrophilic regions.
Rule 20: Presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule is essential for BBBP. 
Rule 21: Molecule should contain a ring system with alternating single and double bonds, a polar functional group capable of forming hydrogen bonds, and a hydrophobic region surrounded by hydrophilic regions.
Rule 22: The presence of a polar functional group, such as an alcohol or a carboxylic acid, at one end of the molecule is necessary.
