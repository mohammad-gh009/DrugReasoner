Rule 1: The ESOL value of a molecule is directly related to its polarity and hydrogen bonding ability. The more polar a molecule and the stronger its ability to form hydrogen bonds, the higher its ESOL value is likely to be. 

Rule 2: The size and shape of the molecule also influences its ESOL value. Larger, more complex molecules usually have lower ESOL values due to having fewer opportunities for hydrogen bonding or polar interactions with water. Conversely, smaller or more linear molecules usually have higher ESOL values due to their greater ability to dissolve in water. 

Rule 3: The ESOL value of a molecule is influenced by its functional groups. The varying polarities, hydrogen bonding abilities, and specific chemical properties, such as the ability to form different types of bonds (like carbonyl groups forming hydrogen bonds) or the presence of halogenated atoms, impact the overall ESOL value of a molecule.
Rule 1: The ESOL value of a molecule is directly linked to its polarity and hydrogen bonding capability. More polar molecules or molecules with more hydrogen bond donors or acceptors have higher ESOL values, as they can form stronger hydrogen bonds with water molecules.
 
Rule 2: A molecule's ESOL value is also determined by its size and shape. Larger, more complex molecules tend to have lower ESOL values as they might have fewer hydrogen bond donors or acceptors, and maybe less soluble in water due to lower surface area available for interaction with water. Conversely, smaller, more linear or symmetrical molecules generally have higher ESOL values due to their increased solubility and hydrogen bonding capability.

Rule 3: The ESOL value of a molecule can be influenced by its functional groups. Different functional groups can contribute differently to the overall polarity and hydrogen bonding ability of a molecule, thus affecting its ESOL value. For instance, a molecule with a carbonyl group (C=O) typically has a higher ESOL value than a molecule with a hydroxyl group (-OH), due to the higher polarity and hydrogen bonding ability of the carbonyl group. Similarly, a molecule containing a halogen atom can increase the polarity and hydrogen bonding ability of the molecule, thus increasing its ESOL value.
