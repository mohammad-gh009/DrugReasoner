Rule 1: If a molecule contains a polar functional group such as a carboxylic acid or amine, it will have low logD values, indicating higher hydrophilicity. 
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nonpolar functional group such as a phenyl ring or a cyclohexyl ring, it will have high logD values, signaling its hydrophobic nature. 
Rule 3: Presence of a halogen atom like chlorine or fluorine in a molecule will lead to an increase in its hydrophobicity and hence its logD value. 
Rule 4: The presence of a charged group like -SO3Na or -COOH in a molecule will result in even higher logD values due to increased polarity.
Rule 5: The presence of more nonpolar functional groups in a molecule will result in a higher logD value; whereas polar functional group-containing molecules will have lower logD values. 
Rule 6: Molecules with a charged functional group such as -NH3+ or -SO3- will have high logD values because they can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a charged functional group such as a sulfonamide or quaternary ammonium salt, it will depend on the polarity of other functional groups in the molecule for its logD values.
Rule 8: A molecule with a higher number of carbon atoms tends to have a higher logD value, indicating increased lipophilicity. 
Rule 9: If a molecule contains both polar and nonpolar functional groups, such as a molecule with a positive charge due to the presence of a nitrogen atom in a ring system, the logD value will depend on the relative balance between the polar and nonpolar groups. 
Rule 10: Fluorine atoms increase the lipophilicity of a molecule by making it more nonpolar.
Rule 1: Molecules containing polar functional groups, such as carboxylic acid or amine, tend to have low logD values showing high hydrophilicity. 
Rule 2: Molecules that include nonpolar functional groups, including phenyl rings or alkane chains, usually have higher logD values indicating more hydrophobicity.
Rule 3: Molecules with charged functional groups, such as sulfonamide or quaternary ammonium ion, often have even higher logD values, indicating significant hydrophobicity. 
Rule 4: Molecules with more hydrophobic regions usually have higher logD values, representing more lipophilicity. 
Rule 5: Molecules with conjugation between multiple Ï€ bonds can experience increased molecular polarity and decreased logD values.
Rule 6: The longer the carbon chain in a molecule, the more likely it is to be hydrophobic, causing a lower logD value.
Rule 7: Halogenation can increase or decrease lipophilicity, depending on whether it's attached to a nonpolar or polar group. 
Rule 8: High logD values are an indication of hydrophobic molecules with nonpolar functional groups, while low values point to hydrophilic molecules with polar functional groups.
Rule 9: Molecules with larger numbers of carbon and hydrogen atoms along with polar functional groups usually yield higher logD values.
Rule 10: Molecules with electronegative elements like fluorine or chlorine tend to have lower logD values as it increases polarity.
Rule 11: If a molecule has a conjugated system of double bonds or aromatic rings, it's likely to have a higher logD value because of increased hydrophobicity.
Rule 12: If a molecule holds a hydrophobic ring system, it can increase the logD value.
Rule 13: The incorporation of a halogen atom in a molecule such as fluorine or chlorine can increase the logD value.
