Rule 1: The polarity of a molecule significantly determines its ESOL value. Higher polarity in molecules results in either higher or lower ESOL values based on their solubility in water due to stronger intermolecular forces between them. For instance, molecules with high polarity due to attached chlorine atoms or the presence of high polar functional groups such as C=O, have lower ESOL values signifying less soluble nature.

Rule 2: The number and nature of functional groups in a molecule can influence the ESOL value. Multiple functional groups like aromatic or heterocyclic rings, carbonyls, alcohols, or halogens usually increase the overall polarity resulting in higher ESOL values. Similarly, the presence of specific functional groups like nitro or carbonyl groups can significantly impact the ESOL values.

Rule 3: Molecular size and shape also play a role in determining the ESOL value. Typically, larger molecules with complex structures have lower ESOL values than smaller, simpler molecules; this is due to more surface area, a longer carbon chain, and higher degrees of freedom, which complicate their dissolution.

Rule 4: The presence of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors within the molecule can affect its ESOL value. Molecules with more hydrogen bond donor or acceptor sites usually have lower ESOL values.

Rule 5: The length and flexibility of the carbon chain in a molecule can influence its ESOL value. Generally, more extended or flexible chains may decrease solubility, thus lowering the ESOL valueâ€”this links to the molecular size and shape rule and further emphasizes the molecule's complexity affecting the ESOL.
Rule 1: The aqueous solubility of a compound and its ESOL value increase with the presence of polar functional groups such as carbonyl, hydroxyl, and amine due to hydrogen bonding between these groups and water molecules.

Rule 2: The ESOL value of a compound can also be affected by the number and position of alkyl substituents present on it. More the alkyl substituents, lower the polarity of the compound and thus it reduces its ability to dissolve in water.

Rule 3: A molecule's hydrophobicity and, therefore, its aqueous solubility decreases with the presence of aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds.

Rule 4: Molecules with higher polarity tend to have higher ESOL values as they form stronger intermolecular forces with water, making them less soluble.

Rule 5: ESOL value can be influenced by the presence of functional groups such as carbonyls or nitro groups which can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules and make the molecule more soluble in water.

Rule 6: The length and complexity of a molecule's carbon chain can also affect its ESOL value and generally points to higher ESOL values for longer chains due to increased hydrophobicity and decreased aqueous solubility.

Rule 7: The presence of halogen atoms or nitro groups could potentially decrease a molecule's ESOL value because these groups increase the polarity of the molecule.

Rule 8: The molecular size and shape of a molecule can affect its ESOL value with larger and more complex molecules tending to have lower ESOL values as they require more energy to break apart their intermolecular interactions and dissolve in water.

Rule 9: Functional groups such as alcohols, aldehydes and carboxylic acids can increase the hydrophilicity of a molecule, leading to a decrease in its ESOL value.
