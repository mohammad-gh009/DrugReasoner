Rule 1: Molecules containing a chlorine atom bonded to two carbon atoms are likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a benzene ring are highly likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) connected to a benzene ring through a single bond may have toxic activity.
Rule 4: Molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) generally have higher toxicity activity towards the SR signaling pathway due to their high reactivity.
Rule 5: Molecules containing a metal ion such as manganese (Mn+2) tend to have high toxicity activity due to their ability to catalyze redox reactions.
Rule 6: Molecules containing a sulfhydryl group (-SH) may have lower toxicity activity, but further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.
Rule 7: Molecules containing a bromine atom are likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 8: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) may not have toxic activity.
Rule 9: Molecules containing a gold atom (Au) bonded to two chlorine atoms are highly likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 10: Molecules containing a silicon atom are less likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 11: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (C=O) conjugated with an aromatic ring are more likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 12: Molecules containing a cyclopropane ring connected to another carbon atom through a single bond may not have toxic activity.
Rule 13: Molecules containing a benzene ring are more likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 14: Molecules containing a phosphate group are less likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 15: Molecules containing a chlorine atom are more likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 16: Molecules containing a sulfur atom bonded to two oxygen atoms, a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-), or a nitro group (-NO2) are likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 17: If the molecule contains halogen atoms like chlorine or bromine, it tends to have lower toxicity activity towards the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 18: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it is likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 19: Molecules containing iodine atoms tend to have higher chances of causing adverse effects, whereas molecules with high electronegativity elements like fluorine tend to have lower toxicity.
Rule 20: The presence of multiple rings in a molecule does not necessarily increase its toxicity.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-C#N), it likely has toxic activity towards the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a metal ion like chromium or platinum, it is likely to have toxic activity towards the SR signaling pathway due to DNA damage and oxidative stress induction.
Rule 3: If a molecule has a nitro group (-NO2), it likely possesses toxic activity towards the SR signaling pathway, which may cause liver injury and other harmful effects due to the generation of reactive oxygen species.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it doesn't necessarily indicate toxic activity towards the SR signaling pathway, but it doesn't confirm safety either. The type of carbonyl group, its position within the molecule, and its chemical environment should also be considered.
Rule 5: When a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), it may have toxic activity towards the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a metal ion like Mn+2, it may have toxic activity against the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 7: If a molecule has a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, it's unlikely to cause toxic activity against the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) attached to an aliphatic chain, it might have toxic activity against the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), it likely has toxic activity towards the SR signaling pathway.
