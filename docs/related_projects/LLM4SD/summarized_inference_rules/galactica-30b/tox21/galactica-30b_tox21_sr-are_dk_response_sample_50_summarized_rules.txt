Rule 1: Molecules that contain nitro groups may likely be toxic due to the high reactivity of nitro groups causing adverse effects. 
Rule 2: Molecules that contain carbonyl groups conjugated with alkene groups may also be potentially toxic as these conjugated carbonyl groups can interfere with the functions of the DNA and proteins.
Rule 3: Molecules that contain chlorine atoms may less likely be toxic. 
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a bromine atom or carbonyl group, it may be likely to have toxic activity.  
Rule 5: Molecules containing a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom or a nitro group may likely have toxic activity. 
Rule 6: If a molecule does not contain a nitro group, chlorine atom or carbonyl group could still be toxic and might be influenced by factors like hydrophobicity, molecular weight, or charge. 
Rule 7: Molecules with cyano group can potentially exhibit toxic activity. 
Rule 8: Molecules that contain iodine atoms can potentially have toxic activity due to their high chances of causing adverse effects. 
Rule 9: Molecules with a large number of multiple rings may not necessarily be toxic. 
Rule 10: Absence of highly electronegative elements like fluorine in a molecule may potentially increase its toxicity. 
Rule 11: Molecules that contain nitro group can potentially be toxic towards Nrf2 ARE SR signaling pathway.
Rule 12: Carbonyl group-containing molecules might have a certain level of toxic activity. However, more factors need to be considered. 
Rule 13: Molecules that contain either sulfur or bromine atom could have lower toxicity activity towards the SR signaling pathway. 
Rule 14: Compounds with high number of rotatable bonds can potentially exhibit toxic activity. 
Rule 15: Compounds with sulfonyl group or carbonyl group next to double bond may not have toxic activity. 
Rule 16: Compounds with sulfonyl group are likely to be toxic and potential inhibitors for Nrf2 activation in SR signaling pathway. 
Rule 17: Compounds that contain a silicon atom bonded to four carbon atoms may exhibit non-toxic activity. 
Rule 18: Compounds that contain two nitrogen atoms connected by carbonyl group may not have any toxic activity.
Rule 1: Molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) tend to have high toxicity activity towards the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a conjugated system of double bonds also tend to have high toxicity activity towards the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a halogen atom like chlorine (Cl) or iodine (I) attached to a carbon atom may have low toxicity activity towards SR signaling pathway.
Rule 4: Molecules containing a cyano group (-C#N) or (-CN) are likely to have toxic activity towards the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 5: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) are unlikely to have toxic activity.
Rule 6: If a compound contains a sulfur atom bonded to two oxygen atoms, it is likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 7: A compound containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-) is also likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a phosphate group (-OPO3), it may also have toxic activity towards the SR signaling pathway but this rule should be used with caution as some phosphates are essential for cellular functions.
Rule 9: Molecules containing a dioxolane ring are likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 10: Molecules containing a sulfonamide group are unlikely to have toxic activity.
Rule 11: Molecules containing a cyano group (-CN) are likely to have toxic activity. 
Rule 12: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it can have high toxicity activity towards the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 13: The presence of a halogen atom such as bromine or chlorine implies moderate toxicity activity towards the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 14: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have toxic activity, but there are exceptions to this rule.
Rule 15: Molecules containing a metal ion such as Mn+2 are likely to have toxic activity against the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 16: Molecules containing a siloxane group (-SiO-) are unlikely to have toxic activity against the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 17: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a double bond between two carbon atoms (-C=C-), it is likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 18: If a molecule contains a bromine atom, it is highly likely to have toxic activity. 
Rule 19: Molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a benzene ring are highly likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 20: Molecules containing a benzene ring may not have toxic activity towards the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), it may have toxic activity. However, this is not a standalone criterion, since factors like concentration, exposure time, and environmental conditions should also be considered.
Rule 2: Presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in a molecule may indicate toxic activity. Nevertheless, this factor alone should not be used to predict toxicity.
Rule 3: The occurrence of chlorine atoms in a molecule may suggest potential toxic activity. Even though chlorine is often used as a disinfectant, health risks are associated with excessive exposure to its byproducts.
