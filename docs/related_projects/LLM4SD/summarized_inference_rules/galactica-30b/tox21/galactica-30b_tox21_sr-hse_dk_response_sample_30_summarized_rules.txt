Rule 1: If the molecule contains either a nitro group (-NO2), a sulfonate group (-SO3-), or a carbonyl group (C=O), it is likely to possess toxic activity. 
Rule 2: The presence of two sodium ions (Na+) bonded together by an oxygen atom in a molecule enhances the chances of said molecule having toxic properties. 
Rule 3: A molecule with a bromine atom (Br) connected to a carbon atom within a ring structure may harbour toxic traits, although further analysis is needed for confirmation. 
Rule 4: If a carbon chain follows the carbonyl group (C=O) in the compound, the molecule is likely to have toxic activity. 
Rule 5: The presence of a chlorine atom (Cl) or a double bond between carbon atoms (C=C) increases the toxicity of the molecule. 
Rule 6: A molecule with a silicon atom followed by two double bonds separated by a single bond is likely to be toxic.  
Rule 7: Molecules likely to possess toxic traits generally possess a phosphorus atom bonded with four other atoms, including two oxygen atoms. 
Rule 8: The presence of bromine atoms increases the likelihood of toxicity. 
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or halogen atoms (Cl, Br, I), it is likely to be toxic towards the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 10: If the molecule includes a CC(C) or CCC chain, then the chance of toxicity is significantly increased. 
Rule 11: If the compound contains a nitro group (-NO2), the presence of toxic activity is more probable.
Rule 12: A molecule with a metal oxide bond (like Cr=O or Si-O-Cr), or a conjugated system of double bonds (for instance, C=C-C=C or O=C-C=C) is likely to have toxic activity. 
Rule 13: Molecules containing sulfonyl groups (-SO2-), carbonyl groups (>C=O), nitro groups (-NO2), carboxylic acid groups (COOH), or halogen atoms may have toxic activity.
Rule 14: The toxic activity of the molecule is more likely if it contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom or a nitro group (-NO2).
Rule 15: If a molecule contains a sulfonate group (-SO3-) or a carbonyl group (>C=O) and a chlorine atom (Cl), it attributes to increased toxicity.
Rule 16: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule it is unlikely to be toxic, as indicated by the absence of molecules containing a nitro group. 

However, these rules do not always hold true and may vary depending on other factors such as concentration, exposure time, and environmental conditions. Therefore, it is crucial to use multiple sources of information and consult with experts in the field for accurate results.
Rule 1: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) may exhibit toxic activity.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a halogen atom such as chlorine (-Cl) or bromine (-Br) are likely not to exhibit toxic activity.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) may demonstrate toxic activity.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom, it may likely to have toxic activity, however there might be exceptions.
Rule 5: A molecule containing a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) is highly likely to demonstrate toxic activity.
Rule 6: Molecules that contain both a benzene ring and a carbonyl group (-C=O) are unlikely to have toxic activity.
Rule 7: Molecules containing a sulfonate group (-SO3-) may have toxic activity.
Rule 8: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (>C=O) and a chlorine atom (Cl) might exhibit toxic activity.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), or contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-), it is likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 10: Molecules without certain functional groups but possess a high degree of hydrophobicity may receive a label of toxic activity.
Rule 11: Molecules with a chlorine atom (Cl) might have toxic activity, but this rule does not always apply.
Rule 12: Molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) are unlikely to have toxic activity, but exceptions might exist.
Rule 13: Presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) might indicate toxic activity but this rule does not always apply.
