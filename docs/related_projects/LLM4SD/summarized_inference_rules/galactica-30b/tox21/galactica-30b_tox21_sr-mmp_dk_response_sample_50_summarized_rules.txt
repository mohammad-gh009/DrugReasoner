Rule
Rule 1: Molecules containing cyano group (-CN) are likely to have toxic effects, often causing liver damage.
Rule 2: Molecules with a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) may not have toxic effects, despite inconsistent findings from some reports of sulfonyl compounds resulting in adverse reactions.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a halogen atom like chlorine (-Cl) or bromine (-Br) are less likely to possess toxic effects due to their role in increasing lipophilicity in drug design.
Rule 4: Molecules containing zinc ion (Zn+2) are less likely to be toxic, implying that metal ions can help reduce toxicity.
Rule 5: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) may be likely to have toxic effects as sulfonyl groups are common to harmful chemicals like pesticides.
