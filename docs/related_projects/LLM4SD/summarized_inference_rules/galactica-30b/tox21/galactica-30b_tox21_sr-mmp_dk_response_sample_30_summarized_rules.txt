Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to have toxic effects due to its high reactivity, potentially provoking adverse effects. 
Rule 2: Molecules containing carbonyl group (-C=O) could have toxic effects due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds and react with other molecules. However, this rule is less universal as the reactivity can vary greatly among different types of carbonyl groups.  
Rule 3: Presence of a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) in a molecule is unlikely to cause toxic effects, as these groups are often found in non-toxic compounds.
Rule 4: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene or alkyne group, it may have toxic effects.
Rule 5: Toxic effects are likely if a molecule contains halogen atoms such as chlorine, bromine, or fluorine.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a mercury atom (Hg) bonded to a carbon atom via a carbonyl group (C=O), it may have toxic effects, due to the disruption of cellular processes caused by mercury.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a bromine atom, it is likely to have toxic effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it is likely to have toxic effects.
Rule 9: Sulfonyl groups in molecules often result in reduced toxicity.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl) attached to an aromatic ring then it is more likely to show toxic effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it may result in toxic effects due to potential allergic reactions or other side effects.
Rule 12: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, it is less likely to have toxic effects.
Rule 13: If a molecule consists of a thiocyanate group (-SCN), it may have toxic effects due to its ability to bind to proteins and enzymes, disrupting cellular functionalities.
Rule 14: Halogen atoms including chlorine and bromine, bonded to two carbon atoms, in a molecule attribute to possible toxicity.
Rule 15: Presence of sulfur atom bonded to two carbon atoms and no other heteroatoms is unlikely to lead to toxic effects.
Rule 16: Compounds containing a nitrogen atom bonded to one carbon atom and another oxygen atom are also unlikely to be toxic.
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine, bromine or fluorine, it is likely to exhibit toxic effects. 
Rule 2: Molecules that contain a nitro group (-NO2) are likely to have toxic effects as they are known to be highly reactive in biological systems. 
Rule 3: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) might display toxic effects as they can cause allergic reactions or other side effects. 
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, it is less likely to exhibit toxic effects.
Rule 5: Molecules with a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom are likely to be toxic.
Rule 6: If a molecule has a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a carbon chain, it may be toxic. 
Rule 7: Should a molecule contain a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it may not be safe. 
Rule 8: Most toxic molecules contain a carbonyl group (C=O). 
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2), it might be toxic, but this does not apply in all cases. 
Rule 10: Toxic molecules often contain a nitro group (NO2). 
Rule 11: The presence of a sulfonyl chloride group (-SO2Cl) in a molecule may indicate its toxicity.
Rule 12: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may potentially harm health, causing conditions like to cancer and birth defects.
Rule 13: Molecules containing a cyano group (-CN) may be toxic as they can cause damage to DNA and other cellular components.
Please note these rules should not be the sole basis to predict toxicity, since factors like dose, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility must also be considered.
