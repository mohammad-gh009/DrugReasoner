Rule 13: Molecules containing functional groups like carbonyl (C=O), nitro (NO2), or sulfonyl (SO2) tend to have lower probabilities of being toxic compared to those without these groups.

Rule 14: The length of the carbon chain also plays a role in determining the toxicity of a molecule. Shorter chains may lead to more toxic compounds while longer ones may result in less toxic compounds.

Rule 15: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, it is likely to have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway.

Rule 16: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway.

Rule 17: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), then it may have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway, with exceptions.

Rule 19: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-), it may also have potential toxic effects.

Rule 20: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have potential toxic effects.

Rule 21: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a phenyl ring, it is likely to have no significant toxicity activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway.

Rule 22: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a phenyl ring, it is likely to have some toxicity activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway.

Rule 23: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) attached to a phenyl ring, it is likely to have high toxicity activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway.

Rule 24: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) attached to an aromatic ring, it may have potential toxic effects.

Rule 25: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it may have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway.

Rule 26: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as fluorine (-F) or chlorine (-Cl), it may have potential toxic effects.

Rule 27: If the molecule contains iodine atoms or other halogens, it has higher chances of being toxic towards the androgen receptor in NR signalling pathways.

Rule 28: Molecules containing conjugated double bonds may also have high toxicity towards the androgen receptor in NR signalling pathways.

Rule 29: If a molecule contains functional groups like carbonyls (C=O), carboxylates (-COOH), or sulfonates (-SO3-), it has lower chance of being toxic towards the androgen receptor in NR signalling pathways.

Rule 30: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, it may have potential for causing adverse effects.

Rule 31: If the molecule contains a bromine atom or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway.

Rule 32: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-), then it may have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway.

Rule 33: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it may have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway.

Rule 34: If a molecule contains chlorine atoms, it may have potential toxic effects.

Rule 35: If a molecule contains multiple rings or conjugated double bonds, it may have potential toxic effects. 

Rule 36: If a molecule contains a bromine atom or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential toxic effects.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) or a nitro group (-NO2), it may have toxic activity towards NR receptors.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a chlorine atom bonded to two carbon atoms, it may have some level of toxicity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (C=O) connected to another carbon atom through a single bond followed by a double bond, it may also have some level of toxicity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 4: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (SO2) or a sulfate group (OSO3), it may have significant toxicity due to their ability to disrupt biological systems.
Rule 5: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), it may have toxic effects due to their ability to interfere with cellular respiration and oxidative phosphorylation.
Rule 6: If the molecule does not contain any of the above mentioned functional groups but has a high degree of conjugation, it may still have toxic effects. However, this rule should be taken with caution as other factors may be involved in determining the overall toxicity of a molecule.
