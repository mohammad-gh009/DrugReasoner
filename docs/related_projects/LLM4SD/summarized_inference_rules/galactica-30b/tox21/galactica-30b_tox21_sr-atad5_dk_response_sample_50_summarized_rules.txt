Rule 1: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, the molecule has a higher chance of causing genotoxic damage than those without halogens and are labelled as having potential toxicity activity (label 1).
Rule 2: Molecules containing carbonyl group (C=O) or a carboxylic acid group (COOH) or a nitro group (NO2) have genotoxic effects due to their ability to form covalent bonds with DNA strands or interact with DNA bases, causing mutations, respectively. Therefore, these molecules should be labelled as potentially toxic.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a halogen can have endocrine disrupting effects due to their ability to mimic natural hormones, and therefore should also be labelled as potentially toxic.
Rule 4: Molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), or iodine (I) have a higher likelihood of being toxic.
Rule 5: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (C=O) could also have toxic effects.
Rule 6: Molecules with a sulfonyl group (SO2) are less likely to have toxic effects.
Rule 7: The presence of functional groups and halogen atoms like chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br) may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 8: The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule might increase its potential for causing adverse effects due to interaction with other molecules.
Rule 9: The absence of polar functional groups reduces a molecule's potential for causing adverse effects, as these groups make the compound more soluble and more likely to be excreted from the body. 
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have genotoxic effects and may cause harm to cells.
Rule 11: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-) or halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) attached to an sp3 carbon can cause significant damage and disrupt normal cellular function.
Rule 12: The presence of negatively charged ions, halogen atoms or functional groups like carbonyls, esters, and amides may increase the likelihood of a molecule causing adverse effects.
Rule 13: The length and complexity of the carbon chain of a molecule also has an influence on its potential toxicity.
Rule 14: The presence of bromine and sulfur atoms in a molecule's structure could either increase or decrease its toxicity.
Rule 15: Compounds containing a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) may have genotoxic effects.
Rule 1: If a compound contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, it may be toxic due to its potential to have genotoxic activity.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it's likely to be toxic due to its potential to have genotoxic activity.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), it may have genotoxic effects as indicated by ATAD5 in the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a phosphate group (-OPO32-) or a thiophosphate group (-OPS3-), it may also have genotoxic effects due to their interference with DNA replication and transcription processes. 
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it may have genotoxic effects as indicated by ATAD5 in the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 6: Molecules containing carbonyl groups such as aldehydes or ketones may have a higher likelihood of being toxic due to their ability to react with DNA and other cellular components. 
Rule 7: Molecules containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or bromine may be toxic because they can interfere with normal cell function through covalent binding or other mechanisms. 
Rule 8: The presence of certain functional groups such as nitro groups or aromatic rings in a molecule may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 9: Molecules containing polar groups such as hydroxyl or amine groups may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds with other molecules.
Rule 10: The length and complexity of a molecule may play a role in determining its toxicity. Longer and more complex molecules may be harder for the body to break down and process, leading to accumulation of toxic metabolites. 
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) or a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), then it may have toxic activity towards genotoxic stress response. 
Rule 12: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have genotoxic effects and potentially lead to adverse health outcomes.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have genotoxic effects due to its ability to form reactive radicals.
Rule 14: If a molecule contains a germanium atom, then it is likely to have genotoxic effects as indicated by ATAD5 in the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 15: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, then it has a high probability of causing genotoxic effects as indicated by ATAD5 in the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 16: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it may have genotoxic effects due to its ability to bind to DNA and disrupt normal cellular processes.
Rule 17: If a molecule contains a bromine atom, it is more likely to have toxic effects than one without due to bromine's known ability to disrupt biological systems.
Rule 18: Molecules with a carbonyl group (C=O) are likely to have toxic effects. Carbonyl groups can react with amino acids in proteins and alter their function, which can lead to cellular damage.
Rule 19: Molecules with a nitro group (NO2) are prone to causing toxic effects due to their high reactivity and ability to form free radicals.
Rule 20: If a compound contains a sulfur atom bonded to two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom, then it may have genotoxic effects due to its ability to form covalent bonds with DNA. 
Rule 21: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it is likely to have toxic effects. 
Rule 22: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it has high probability of causing genotoxic damage. 
Rule 23: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), it may have genotoxic effects and potentially cause harm to cells. 
Rule 24: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a double bond between two carbon atoms, then it may have potential genotoxic effects. 
Rule 25: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl), then it may have mutagenic effects and potentially cause genetic mutations.
