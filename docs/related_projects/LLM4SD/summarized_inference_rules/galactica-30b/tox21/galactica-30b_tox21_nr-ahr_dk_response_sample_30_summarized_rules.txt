Rule 8: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), it may have toxic effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a benzofuran ring system, it may have toxic effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), it may have potential toxic effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-), it may have potential toxic effects.
Rule 12: If a molecule contains a bromine atom (Br) attached to an sp3 carbon atom, it likely has potential toxic effects.
Rule 13: If the molecule contains a bromine atom and no other halogen atoms, it is likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 14: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and no other functional groups, it is unlikely to have toxic activity.
Rule 15: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom and a carbon-carbon double bond adjacent to each other, it is unlikely to have toxic activity.
Rule 16: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring, it is likely to have toxic activity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 17: If a molecule contains a sulfone group (-SO2R), it may not have toxic activity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 18: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom bonded to two nitrogen atoms, it is less likely to have toxic effects.
Rule 19: If a molecule contains a benzene ring and a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 20: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom and a benzene ring connected by a single bond, it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 21: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom and a carbon-carbon triple bond, it is also unlikely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 22: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) followed by two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom i.e (-C=O.CC.O), it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a bromine atom or a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to be toxic towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) or a carboxylic acid group (COOH), it likely possesses toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom and no other halogen atoms, it is likely to exhibit toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) but no other functional groups, it is unlikely to exhibit toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, it is likely to be toxic against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is typically not toxic towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it may exhibit toxic activity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 8: If the molecule contains a bromine atom and no other halogen atoms, it is likely to have toxic activity (label 1).
Rule 9: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom and a carbon-carbon double bond adjacent to each other, it is unlikely to have toxic activity (label 0).
