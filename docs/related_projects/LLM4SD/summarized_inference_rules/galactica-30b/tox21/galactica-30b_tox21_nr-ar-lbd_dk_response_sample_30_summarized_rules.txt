Rule 17: A carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a carbon atom at position 1, 2, or 3 in a molecule suggests its likelihood of having toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain.

Rule 18: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-C#N) or a thiocarbonyl group (-C=S), it might have toxic effects towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain.

Rule 19: A molecule with a bromine atom or a cyano group (-CN) may have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain.

Rule 20: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it could show toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain.

Rule 21: Molecules containing a phosphorus atom bonded to six carbon atoms and two other carbon atoms may have toxic effects towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the NR signaling pathway.

Rule 22: The presence of a carbonyl group attached to a carbon atom that also has a double bond to another carbon atom in a molecule possibly indicates its toxic effects towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain.

Rule 23: If a molecule contains a bromine atom connected to a carbon atom with a double bond to another carbon atom, it is likely to have toxic effects towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain. 

Rule 24: If a molecule has a cyano group (-CN), carbonyl group (-C=O), or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it denotes possible toxic effects.

Rule 25: The presence of multiple chlorine atoms (-Cl) in a molecule often signifies its potential for toxic effects. 

Note: These rules are rough estimations based on a limited dataset, and should not be deemed as absolute predictors for toxicity. Some exceptions may apply, and further research is always advisable.
