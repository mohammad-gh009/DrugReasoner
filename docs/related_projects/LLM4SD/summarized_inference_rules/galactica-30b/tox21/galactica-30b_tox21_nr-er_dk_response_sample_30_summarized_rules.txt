Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it may have toxic effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing sulfur atoms are more likely to have toxic effects.
Rule 3: The presence of molecular weight or hydrophobicity does not clearly link to toxicity.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it may have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a sodium ion (Na+) bonded to a sulfate group (-OSO3-), it may also have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl) attached to a carbon atom that is part of a ring structure, it may have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), it is very likely to have toxic effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), it may have toxic effects.
Rule 9: Molecules with nitrogen-containing rings, such as pyridine or pyrimidine, are generally less likely to have toxic effects.
Rule 10: Molecules containing a carbonyl (C=O) or sulfonyl (SO2R) group may have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 11: Molecules with halogen atoms for example, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, may also have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 12: A molecule containing a nitro group (NO2) may show toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it is generally unlikely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 14: If a molecule contains a benzene ring with at least one hydroxyl group attached to it, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 15: Carbonyl group (C=O) or a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), presence in a molecule, increases the likelihood of toxic effects.
Rule 16: A molecule with a nitrogen atom bonded to at least one other non-hydrogen atom may exhibit toxic effects.
Rule 17: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a nitrile group (-CN), it is likely to have toxic activity towards the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 18: Molecules with a halogen atom such as fluorine (-F) or chlorine (-Cl) may also have toxic activity towards the NR signaling pathway, but it needs further analysis to confirm this.
Rule 19: If a molecule has a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, it may have potential toxic effects.
Rule 20: The presence of a functional group like carbonyl (C=O) or sulfonyl (SO2R) in a molecule suggests its potential toxic effects.
Rule 21: A molecule with a silicon atom and no other atoms except for oxygen or carbon, is likely non-toxic.
Rule 22: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a germanium atom (Ge), it is likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 23: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with another double bond such as a carbon-carbon triple bond (-Câ‰¡C-) or a silicon-oxygen double bond (-Si=O), it is also likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 24: If a molecule contains a bromine atom (Br) bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to a nitrogen atom, it may have potential toxic activity.
Rule 25: In a molecule with a sulfur atom bonded to a positively charged oxygen atom while also includes two fluorine atoms, then it may have toxicity activity.
Rule 26: If a molecule contains a phosphate group or includes a negatively charged oxygen atom bonded to a phosphorus and two carbon atoms, it is likely to have toxicity activity.
Rule 27: If a molecule has a benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group through a single bond, it's unlikely to have toxicity.
Rule 28: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, it is likely to have toxic effects.
Rule 29: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) adjacent to an aromatic ring, it is likely to have toxic effects.
Rule 1: If a molecule consists of a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), such molecule will likely have toxic effects, possibly towards the estrogen receptor. 

Rule 2: Molecules imbued with bromine atoms are more likely to have toxic effects than those lacking bromine atoms. 

Rule 3: Compounds with carbonyl groups (C=O) generally exhibit higher toxicity levels in comparison to those not containing them. 

Rule 4: Molecules integrated with nitrogen atoms might also possess increased toxicity levels due to the ability to form hydrogen bonds with other molecules. 

Rule 5: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom, such compound may have toxic effects.

Rule 6: Molecules which contain a halogen atom, such as chlorine or bromine, attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), can also have toxic effects. 

Rule 7: Molecules integrated with a nitrogen-containing ring, like pyridine or pyrimidine, are less likely to have toxic effects; however, there may be exceptions.

Rule 8: Molecules possessing a bromine atom bonded to an oxygen atom through a double bond (O=C(O)Br) will likely exhibit toxic effects.

Rule 9: Molecules comprising a conjugated system of alternating single and double bonds exhibit high possibilities of having toxic effects.

Rule 10: Molecules with a sulfur atom bonded to two carbon atoms and a nitrogen atom in a ring structure are unlikely to have toxic effects. 

Rule 11: If a molecule consists of a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-), the molecule will likely have toxic effects.

Rule 12: Molecules containing a benzene ring (-C6H5) or a naphthalene ring (-C10H7) may exhibit toxic effects, though this rule is less specific than others.
