Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), it may have toxic effects. However, other factors such as concentration, exposure time, and environmental conditions also influence toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it may have toxic effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5), it could be toxic.
Rule 4: The presence of negatively charged functional groups such as carboxylates and phosphates can increase the chance of causing adverse effects by interfering with cellular processes.
Rule 5: Aromatic rings or conjugated systems in a molecule may heighten the likelihood of causing adverse effects due to their ability to interact with biological macromolecules.
Rule 6: Presence of certain chemical moieties like metal ions or organometallic compounds can increase the probability of causing adverse effects due to their reactivity and potential for forming covalent bonds with biomolecules.
Rule 7: If the molecule has a bromine atom and a carbonyl group, then it may have toxic activity towards the DNA damage p53-pathway in the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 8: A nitro group (NO2) in a molecule indicates potential toxic activity towards the DNA damage p53-pathway in the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 9: The presence of a sulfonamide group (R-SO2-NR'2) can cause toxic effects as it is known to inhibit enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains sulfur that can potentially bind to DNA and cause mutations, then it is likely to have toxic effects. 
Rule 11: Halogens increase the reactivity of molecules and can affect their ability to bind to biological targets, hence molecules with halogen atoms tend to possess higher probabilities to be toxic.
Rule 12: Molecules with conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings are less likely to have toxic effects due to reduced reactivity and lower affinity towards biological targets.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), it's potential for toxicity increases, due to their ability to react with other molecules and disrupt normal cellular processes.
Rule 14: If a compound has a negative charge on one of its atoms, it may also have toxic effects because it can interact with positively charged ions inside cells.
Rule 15: A sulfur atom and no other functional groups or atoms that could potentially contribute to its toxicity, then the molecule may have some level of toxicity.
Rule 16: Sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in a molecule may be an indication of high toxicity.
Rule 17: If a molecule contains iodine atoms, then it is likely to have toxic effects.
Rule 18: A carbonyl group (C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-) in a molecule, may increase chances of toxic effects.
Rule 19: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom, then it may have toxic effects. It's noted that these rules are based on a limited set of examples and should only be used as a starting point.
Rule 20: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2), it may signify toxicity.
Rule 21: A nitro group in the molecule might signify high toxicity.
Rule 1: If the structure of the molecule features a cyano group (-CN), it is likely to induce toxicity including potential DNA damage and cancer development. 

Rule 2: Toxic effects are also likely if there is carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with another double bond like alkene (-C=C-) or alkyne (-C#C-). These molecules interact with DNA causing mutations and potential health issues.

Rule 3: A molecule containing phosphate group (-OPO3H2) is likely safe and non-toxic, as phosphates are essential for cell functioning and metabolism. 

Rule 4: Molecules with functional groups such as nitro groups or halogenated compounds could cause negative effects on the SR signaling pathway.

Rule 5: Presence of a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in a molecule points towards potential toxicity.

Rule 6: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it is likely to exhibit toxic effects.

Rule 7: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), it may be toxic, disrupting normal cellular processes. 

Rule 8: A sulfonyl group (-SO2-) in a molecule could indicate potential toxic activity due to it inhibiting enzymes involved in detoxification. 

Rule 9: Presence of a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) or a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule likely indicates toxicity, as these groups are known to interact with proteins causing adverse effects. 

Rule 10: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), it may exhibit toxicity. 

Rule 11: Toxicity is also associated with molecules featuring a nitrogen-containing ring such as pyridine or pyrimidine. 

Rule 12: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom or a carbonyl group (C=O), it probably possesses toxic effects towards the DNA damage p53-pathway in the SR signaling pathway.
