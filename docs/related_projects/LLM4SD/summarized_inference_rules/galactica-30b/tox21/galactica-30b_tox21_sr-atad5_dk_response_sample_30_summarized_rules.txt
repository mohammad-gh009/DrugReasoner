Rule 1: Molecules with a phosphate group (O=P(O)(O)O) or a sulfonate group (SO3R) are more likely to cause genotoxic damage in the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 2: Molecules with conjugated double bonds such as CC/C=C\CCCCCO can interact with DNA, increasing the likelihood of genotoxic damage.
Rule 3: Molecules with halogen atoms such as chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br) may increase toxicity risk due to their ability to form reactive free radicals.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a bromine or sulfur atom, it may have toxic effects. This applies especially to molecules labeled as "0.0" that contain these atoms.
Rule 5: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (C=O) are more likely to have toxic effects.
Rule 6: Molecules with a nitro group (NO2) are likely to have toxic effects.
Rule 7: Molecules containing a benzene ring or similar structure indicated by the SMILES string c1ccc2ccccc2c1 have a high probability of causing genotoxic effects.
Rule 8: Molecules containing a chlorine atom indicated by the SMILES string Cl may be more likely to cause genotoxic effects due to its ability to react with other molecules.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), it may have genotoxic effects.
Rule 10: Molecules with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) adjacent to a nitrogen atom may hold potential genotoxic effects.
Rule 11: Molecules containing a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine may have potential mutagenic effects due to their interaction with DNA.
Rule 12: Molecules with functional groups such as carbonyls or carboxylic acids have a higher risk of causing adverse effects due to their ability to interact with biological systems.
Rule 13: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure may affect its potential toxicity, as longer chains and complex structures potentially lead to accumulation and harm.
Rule 14: Molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom like bromine (Br) or chlorine (Cl) are more likely to have genotoxic effects.
Rule 15: Molecules with a carbonyl group (C=O) conjugated with an aromatic ring may also have genotoxic effects.
Rule 16: Molecules containing a sulfonamide group (SO2NH2) might have toxic effects as sulfonamides are known to disrupt the immune system.
Rule 17: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom like chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br), it may have toxic effects.
Rule 18: Molecules with a carbonyl group (C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (C=C) could have toxic effects.
Rule 19: Compounds containing a sulfonyl group (SO2R), a nitro group (NO2), or aromatic rings might possess toxic properties.
Rule 20: Molecules with functional groups like carbonyl (C=O) or carboxylic acid (COOH) can have toxic effects.
Rule 21: Compounds with sulfur or nitrogen atoms bonded to multiple carbon atoms possibly have toxic effects.
Rule 22: The presence of functional groups like carbonyl group (C=O) and halogen atoms in molecules may increase the risk of adverse effects.
Rule 23: The absence of polar functional groups such as hydroxyl (OH) or amine (NH2) in molecules may decrease their toxicity potential.
Rule 24: If a molecule contains a germanium atom, it is likely to have genotoxic effects. This applies particularly to molecules containing germanium.
Rule 25: Molecules containing a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom may have genotoxic effects due to its ability to form reactive radicals.
Rule 26: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (C=O) or a double bond between the carbon atoms may have cytotoxic effects.
Rule 27: Molecules containing a silicon atom bonded to two other carbon or oxygen atoms might have genotoxic effects.
Rule 28: Molecules containing bromine atoms attached to the same carbon atom could also have genotoxic effects.
Rule 29: Molecules containing a nitrogen atom connected to at least one carbon atom and one hydrogen atom may not have significant genotoxic effects.

Summarised Rules:

Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) or a carboxylic acid group (COOH), it is likely to have genotoxic effects. These molecules should be labeled as toxic.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), it is likely to have mutagenic effects. These molecules should also be labeled as toxic.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br), it is likely to have endocrine disrupting effects. These molecules should also be labeled as toxic.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, it is more likely to have toxic effects. 
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it is more likely to have toxic effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), or iodine (I), it is likely to have toxic effects. 
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it is likely to have toxic effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2), it is less likely to have toxic effects.
