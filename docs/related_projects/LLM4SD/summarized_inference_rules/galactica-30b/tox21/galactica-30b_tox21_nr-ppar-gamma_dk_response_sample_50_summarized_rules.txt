----------Summary--------------

Rule 1: Molecules that contain a nitro group (-NO2) might have potentially toxic effects but other factors such as dosage, exposure duration, and individual susceptibility also contribute.
Rule 2: Molecules comprising a phosphate group (-PO4) might exhibit toxic effects. Having a halogenated alkyl group along with the phosphate group further suggests toxicity potential.
Rule 3: Molecules with multiple aromatic rings connected by conjugated double bonds may have toxic effects. These structures can form DNA adducts and induce mutations, leading to carcinogenicity.
Rule 4: Molecules containing a bromine atom are likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. However, the generalizability of this rule may not be strong, due to limited sample size in the dataset.
Rule 5: Besides bromine, nitro groups (-NO2) associated molecules also likely exhibit toxic behavior towards PPAR receptors. However, this rule needs further validation due to lack of data.
Rule 6: Molecules without a bromine atom or nitro group but having a high number of rotatable bonds (>5) may not be toxic to PPAR receptors. High flexibility in molecular structures, facilitated by these bonds, might reduce toxic potential.
