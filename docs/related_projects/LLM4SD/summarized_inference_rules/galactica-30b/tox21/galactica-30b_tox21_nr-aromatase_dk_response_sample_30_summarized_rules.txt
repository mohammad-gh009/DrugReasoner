Rule 1: Molecules containing a bromine atom and a carbonyl group are likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. 

Rule 2: Molecules containing a nitro Group (-NO2) or a halogen atom attached to an aromatic ring tend to have toxic effects due to their ability to bind to receptors in the body.

Rule 3: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group or a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) may have potential toxic effects, either by reacting with other molecules or inhibiting enzymes in the body.

Rule 4: Only one molecule with a bromine atom and a sodium ion is observed with potential toxic activity, requiring further validation.

Rule 5: Molecules containing a cyano group (-CN) or a nitro group (-NO2), may not exhibit toxic activity.

Rule 6: Molecules with bromine atom and a cyclopentane ring, carbonyl group and a double bond between two carbon atoms, or a nitrogen atom bonded to four other non-hydrogen atoms, suggest likelihood towards toxic activity, but require expert consultation.

Rule 7: Molecules with a chlorine atom are associated with toxic activity.

Rule 8: Molecules with a sulfonyl group (SO2R) suggest likelihood towards toxic activity, requiring further research.

Rule 9: Molecules with a cyano group (-CN) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) are likely to exhibit toxic activity, whereas those containing bromine (Br) or iodine (I) atoms tend to show unlikely toxic activity.

Rule 10: Molecules with phosphate group (-OPO3R2) may have toxic activity but require more evidence.

Rule 11: If a molecule contains a benzene ring or similar aromatic system, they may exhibit toxic activity, but molecules with halogen atoms are less likely to exhibit toxic activity. Nitro groups still exhibit high likelihood for toxic activity.

Rule 12: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a phosphate group (-OPO32-), they are likely to show no toxic activity.

Rule 13: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), they may show toxic effects. If they contain a halogen atom attached to a carbon atom, even then they may exhibit toxic effects. Nitrogen-containing rings also exhibit a potential for toxic effects. 

Rule 14: If the molecule contains a bromine atom, they are likely to exhibit toxic activity. Molecules with carbonyl groups may exhibit toxic activity. If the molecule has a sulfonyl group (SO2), it also may exhibit toxic activity.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a phosphorus atom bonded to two oxygen atoms, it may have toxic activity towards the NR signaling pathway through binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.
Rule 2: A molecule may have potential for causing toxic activity towards the NR signaling pathway if it contains a carbonyl group (C=O) connected to a carbon chain.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), it may have toxic activity towards the NR signaling pathway due to its potentially disruptive properties to electron transfer reactions in cells.
Rule 4: Molecules which contain a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) may have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway, based on evidence from dataset labels.
Rule 5: If the molecule contains either a cyano group (-CN) or a carbonyl group (-C=O) next to a double bond (-C=C-), it may have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway, based on the determined dataset and labels.
Rule 6: Molecules containing a silicon atom bonded to four oxygen atoms are likely non-toxic based on the limited dataset, although further research is required for confirmation.
Rule 7: If the molecule contains a bromine atom and a carbonyl group (C=O), it is likely non-toxic based on given dataset and labels, however this still requires more investigation.
Rule 8: If the molecule has structural elements of a chlorine atom and a nitro group (NO2), it is likely to be toxic based on a finding from a given dataset. This rule has its limitations without further study.
Rule 9: A molecule is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway if it contains either a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O). This rule is determined based on the dataset and labels.
