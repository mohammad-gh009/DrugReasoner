Rule 1: Molecules containing sulfonyl groups (-SO2-), nitro groups (-NO2), carbonyl groups (-C=O), cyano groups (-CN), or halogen atoms such as chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br) may have potential toxic effects.
Rule 2: Molecules that contain a carbonyl group conjugated with an alkene (C=C) group or a nitrogen-containing ring such as pyridine or pyrimidine, may also demonstrate potential toxic effects.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a nitro group (-NO2) may have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 4: Molecules containing a long chain of carbon atoms without any functional groups, or a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with another double bond, such as in a diene or enone system, may not be toxic.
Rule 5: The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) or thiocarbonyl groups (C=S) may indicate toxic activity.
Rule 6: The impact of halogens on toxicity depends on several factors such as the position and number of halogen atoms, as well as the overall chemical context of the compound.
Rule 7: If a compound contains a benzene ring or a similar aromatic system, a phosphate group, or a metal ion such as iron, then it may have potential toxic effects.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group attached to a carbon atom that also has a double bond to another carbon atom or a phosphorus atom bonded to six carbon atoms as well as two other carbon atoms, then it is likely to have toxic effects.
Rule 9: Molecules containing chlorine atoms (-Cl) attached to aromatic rings, chlorine atoms bonded to a carbon atom at position 1 or 4, or a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom, may have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 10: If the molecule contains bromine atoms, then it is likely to have toxic effects, but if it contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it may be less likely to be toxic. However, this rule does not apply to all cases since some molecules containing carbonyl groups do not exhibit any toxic activity.
Rule 11: These conclusions are based on a limited dataset and should be used cautiously when predicting the toxicity of new compounds. Further research and testing would be needed to validate their accuracy and applicability.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), a chlorine atom (Cl), a bromine atom, or attached to a benzene ring, then it is likely to exhibit toxic activity in the NR signaling pathway. 
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (C=C) or adjacent to a double bond (-C=C-), it is less likely to possess toxic activity in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a sulfonate group (-SO3-) connected to an aromatic ring, it may have toxic activity in the NR signaling pathway. On the contrary, presence of a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) may also indicate potential non-toxicity.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-C#N) or a thiocarbonyl group (-C=S), it has potential for toxicity.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, it is likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom (N) bonded to at least one other non-hydrogen atom, toxic activity is less likely.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a phosphorus atom bonded to two oxygen atoms and at least one carbon-carbon double bond, it may have toxic activity.
Rule 8: Conjugation between the carbonyl group and other unsaturated groups may increase the reactivity of the molecule and lead to toxic effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule includes a phosphate group (-PO4R) or a halogen atom such as chlorine (-Cl) or bromine (-Br), its potential for toxicity increases.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) or a phosphate group (-OPO3R2), it can trigger immune responses, leading to allergic reactions or other negative health outcomes.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to carbon or oxygen atoms, it is likely to exhibit toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to a carbon chain, it is less likely to exhibit toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 3: The presence of a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) attached to a benzene ring in a molecule suggests potential toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 4: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a phosphate group (-OPO32-) may exhibit toxic effects, while further research is needed for confirmation.
Rule 5: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-CH=CH-) could potentially show toxic effects.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have toxic effects although further research is required to establish the exact relationship.
