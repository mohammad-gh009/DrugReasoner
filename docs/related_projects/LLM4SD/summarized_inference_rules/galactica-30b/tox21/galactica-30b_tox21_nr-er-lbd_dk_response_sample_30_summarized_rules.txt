Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), a nitro group (-NO2), a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, bromine atom, or a conjugated system of double bonds, it may potentially exhibit signs of toxicity.
Rule 2: Presence of a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom like chlorine (Cl), fluorine (F), or bromine (Br) attached to a benzene ring may render a molecule toxic.
Rule 3: Toxicity could be invoked in a molecule if a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2) exists in it. 
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (represented by the functional group symbol C=O), there may be a likelihood of toxicity towards the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 5: Nitriles, sulfonylureas, or carboxylic acids (-COOH) in a molecule may be signs of potential toxicity.
Rule 6: A molecule is likely to possess toxic effects if it contains cyano groups (-C#N) and sulfonyl groups (-SO2R).
Rule 7: A molecule is likely to have toxic effects if it contains bromine atoms, carbon-carbon double bonds, a sulfur atom bonded to two nitrogen atoms, or a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group etc.
Rule 8: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl), or a benzene ring (C6H5) or other aromatic rings, it may also have toxic effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a bromine atom or a chlorine atom, a nitro group (-NO2), and a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it can have toxic effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a sulfonate group (-SO3-) or a sulfate group (-OSO3-), or a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-), then it may have potential toxic effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a silicon atom bonded to four oxygen atoms, a bromine atom bonded to two carbon atoms, or a magnesium ion bonded to six oxygen atoms, then it may likely be non-toxic.
O)(=O)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, etc.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains an organic halogen atom (represented by the SMILES string Br or similar), then it may have potential toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules such as BrCCCCCCBr, ClCCCCC(F)(F)O, FC(Br)(Cl)Cl, COc1cc(OC)c(OC)cc1C=O, CCONCS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, BrCCCCC(C)O, BrCCCCC(C)=O, etc.

Based on this dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) or naphthalene structure (c1cccc2c1cccc2), then it may have potential toxic effects. This is designated by labels like "1.0" and "3.0" in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or chloro group (-Cl), it may also have potential toxic effects. This is designated by labels like "2.0" and "3.0" in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) or sulfonate group (-SO3-), then it may have potential toxic effects. This is designated by labels like "3.0" and "4.0" in the dataset.
