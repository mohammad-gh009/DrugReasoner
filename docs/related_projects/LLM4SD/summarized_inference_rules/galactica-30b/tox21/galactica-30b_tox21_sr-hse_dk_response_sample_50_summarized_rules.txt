Rule 20: Molecules containing a sulfur atom bonded to two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom are also likely to have toxic behaviour.
Rule 21: Molecules with a nitro or halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) attached to an aromatic ring seem to have toxic behaviour. 
Rule 22: In certain cases, it has been observed that if a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and a double bond between two carbon atoms, then it may also have toxic activity. 
Rule 23: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl), then the molecule is more likely to have toxic activity. 
Rule 24: In cases where HSF Reporter Gene Assay has been conducted, molecules having no functional group, and no ring structure, seems to signify toxic behaviour.
Rule 25: The molecules containing a sulfonyl group (SO2R) and no other functional groups or rings, also hint at probable toxic behaviour.
Rule 26: A molecule with a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and a halogen atom can increase the chances of interaction with target protein involved in SR signaling pathway for the demonstration of toxic behaviour.
Rule 27: Molecules having both a carbonyl group and a conjugated system of double bonds are likely to exhibit toxic behaviour.
Rule 28: Molecules having a sulfonamide group are most likely to exhibit toxic behaviour.
Rule 29: Presence of nitro group implies the unlikely chance of having toxic activity for the SR signaling pathway.
Rule 30: Molecules containing at least one halogen atom are likely to have toxic activity towards the SR signaling pathway. 
Rule 31: If a molecule contains a nitro group or a thiocarbonyl group, the molecule is highly associated with toxic activity.
Rule 32: Nitro or sulphonate groups in a molecule make it likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 33: Molecules with a sulfur atom bonded to two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom very strongly indicate toxic behaviour.
Rule 34: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group or a halogen atom such as bromine or chlorine, then it may have toxic activity.
Rule 35: The nitro group or a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) also highly indicates toxic behaviour.
Rule 36: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulphonate group (-SO3-), then it is very likely to have toxic activity.
