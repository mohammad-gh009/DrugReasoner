Rule 12: If the molecule contains bromine or chlorine atoms, it is likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 13: If the molecule contains a sulfonate group (SO3-), it is unlikely to have toxic activity.
Rule 14: If molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), it may have potential toxic effects. 
Rule 15: If the molecule contains a phosphate group (PO4R), it may have toxic activity.
Rule 16: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom and a carbonyl group, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 17: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), or iodine (I), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 18: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 1: Molecules with a bromine atom and a carbonyl group are likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in NR signaling pathways.
Rule 2: Molecules that contain a carbon-carbon double bond and a carbonyl group are also likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 3: Molecules with a sulfur atom and a carbonyl group could have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway but should be analyzed cautiously due to exceptions.
Rule 4: Molecules with a benzene ring or similar aromatic system are more likely to have toxic activity for the fact that many known ligands for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor contain aromatic rings.
Rule 5: Molecules containing halogen atoms would be less likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. The presence of halogens can modify the physical and chemical properties of the compound and may cause health effects such as endocrine disruption and developmental toxicity.
Rule 6: Molecules containing a nitro group are more likely to have toxic activity. Nitro groups commonly found in pesticides and other industrial chemicals can be highly reactive and toxic and may disrupt function of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.
Rule 7: In presence of a bromine atom, there is likelihood for toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.
Rule 8: Molecules with a sulfonyl group are unlikely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathways.
Rule 9: Molecules with a conjugated system of double bonds or aromatic rings may have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, but these rules need to be applied cautiously due to limited supporting data.
Rule 10: Molecules containing a chlorine atom and no other halogen atoms may have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.
Rule 11: Presence of nitro group or azide group in molecules suggests it's unlikely for them to exhibit toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.
Rule 12: A molecule containing a carbonyl group conjugated with an alkene group is also unlikely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.
Rule 13: Molecules with nitro group or a halogen atom attached to an aromatic ring may have potential toxic effects due to their ability to bind to receptors in the body.
Rule 14: Presence of a carbonyl group conjugated with alkene group in a molecule could lead to potential toxic effects through a process called Michael addition.
Rule 15: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group can potentially inhibit enzymes in the body leading to toxic effects.
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom and no other halogen atoms, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a carbonyl group (COR), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, then it is also unlikely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a thiocarbonyl group (CS), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 5: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) or a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 6: If the molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 7: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), or iodine (I), then it may have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway but it's not reliable as some exceptions exist.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have toxic activity towards NR signaling pathways involving the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.
