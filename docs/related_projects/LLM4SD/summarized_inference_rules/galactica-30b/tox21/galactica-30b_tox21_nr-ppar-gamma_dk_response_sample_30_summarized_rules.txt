Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), a nitro group (-NO2), or a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-) or is a functional group of the format CCC(=O)O, it is predictive of toxic activity towards PPAR receptors.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a bromine atom (Br) bonded to two carbon atoms or a high number of rotatable bonds (>5), toxic activity towards PPAR receptors is likely.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-C#N) or a chlorine atom, it could indicate toxic activity towards PPAR receptors.
Rule 5: If the molecule has a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom, it may have toxic activity.
Rule 6: If the molecule contains a carbonyl chloride group (-COCl), it is likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors.
Rule 7: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, it is less likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors.
Rule 8: If the molecule contains a long chain of carbon atoms without any functional groups or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. 
Rule 9: If the molecule contains a phosphorus atom bonded to four carbon atoms through double bonds or a phosphate group (-PO4-) or a phosphonate group (-PO3R2), it is unlikely to exhibit toxic activity. 
Rule 10: If the molecule does not contain either a bromine atom nor a nitro group, it may not have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains bromine atoms, it is more likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors.
Rule 2: Molecules that contain a carbonyl group (C=O) conjugated with a double bond (C=C) are less likely to demonstrate toxic activity towards PPAR receptors.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a nitro group (NO2) are unlikely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a bromine atom or a chlorine atom, it is probable to exhibit toxic activity towards PPAR receptors.
Rule 5: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group (SO2R) are unlikely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) followed by a double bond (=), it is likely to have toxic activity.
Rule 7: Molecules including sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2) are likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors.
Rule 8: Molecules featuring a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-) are also likely to show toxic activity towards PPAR receptors.
Rule 9: In case the molecule incorporates a bromine atom (Br) bonded to two carbon atoms and another Br atom connected to one of these carbons, it is highly probable to present toxic activity towards PPAR receptors.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a nitrate group (-ONO2), it is anticipated to reveal toxic activity towards PPAR receptors.
Rule 11: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-CH=CH-) may also have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors.
Rule 12: If a molecule includes a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it likely does not have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors.
