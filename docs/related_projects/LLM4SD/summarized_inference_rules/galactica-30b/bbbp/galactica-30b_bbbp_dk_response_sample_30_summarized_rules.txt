Rule 4: Compounds with the functional group "-C#N" have a tendency to be BBBP.
Rule 5: Compounds with two or more benzene rings connected by single bonds may be BBBP.
Rule 6: Compounds with chlorine atoms on adjacent carbon atoms may be BBBP.
Rule 7: Compounds with a benzene ring and carbonyl group connected by a single bond cannot be BBBP.
Rule 8: Compounds with the "-NO2" functional group cannot be BBBP due to their high reactivity and toxicity.
Rule 9: Compounds with a conjugated system of double bonds or aromatic rings may have higher BBBP likelihood.
Rule 10: Compounds with polar functional groups like hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino groups have a lower BBBP probability.
Rule 11: A molecule with a double bond between two carbon atoms has a high likelihood of being BBBP.
Rule 12: A molecule with chlorine and carbonyl group connected by a single bond has a low BBBP likelihood.
Rule 13: A molecule with a nitrogen-containing ring and fluorine atom has a moderate BBBP likelihood.
Rule 14: Compounds with the functional group "-C=C-" may be BBBP.
Rule 15: Compounds that have a halogen atom tend not to be BBBP.
Rule 16: Compounds that contain a nitrogen atom bonded to three carbon atoms are less likely to be BBBP.
Rule 17: Benzene ring presence indicates a high BBBP probability.
Rule 18: Compounds with halogen atoms like fluorine or chlorine have low BBBP probability.
Rule 19: Compounds with a nitro group (-NO2) have a moderate BBBP chance.
Rule 20: The "-CCONHC-" functional group suggests the compound not being BBBP.
Rule 21: Compounds with "-CCl-" or "-CCl2-" functional groups may be BBBP.
Rule 22: Compounds with "-CC#N-" functional group may be BBBP.
Rule 23: The "-COOH" functional group indicates a compound not being BBBP.
Rule 24: Compounds with a double bond between carbon atoms may have BBBP probability.
Rule 25: Compounds with aromatic rings in their structure may have BBBP possibility.
Rule 26: Compounds with the "-NO2" functional group indicate not being BBBP.
Rule 27: Compounds with a halogen atom like chlorine or bromine cannot be BBBP.
Rule 28: Compounds with a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) are unlikely to be BBBP.
Rule 29: Compounds with a benzene ring connected to a carbonyl or imine groups through a single bond may be BBBP.
Rule 30: Compounds with a nitrogen atom bonded to three carbon atoms in a ring structure may be BBBP.
Rule 31: Molecules with a halogen atom attached to carbon atom may be BBBP.
Rule 32: The functional group "-CC-" suggests the compound could be BBBP.
Rule 33: With the presence of a nitrogen atom bonded to three carbon atoms or more in the molecular structure, the compound may not be BBBP.
Rule 34: With two benzene rings connected by a single bond in the molecular structure, the compound may not be BBBP. 
Rule 35: Compounds with a bromine atom in its structure are likely to have BBBP property.
Rule 36: Compounds containing nitrogen in their structure have a higher BBBP probability.
Rule 37: Compounds with a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond system likely have moderate BBBP probabilities. 
Rule 38: The presence of the functional group "-NOC(=N1)C" indicates the compound may be BBBP.
Rule 39: The functional group "-CN1CCCC1" indicates that these compounds may possess BBBP properties.
Rule 40: The "CCSNC" functional group is characteristic of BBBP molecules. 
Rule 41: If there is a benzene ring present with no other functional groups, the compound likely has BBBP properties.
Rule 42: Compounds with a nitro group attached to the carbon chain may not be BBBP.
Rule 43: If a fluorine atom is present on the aromatic ring or adjacent to the double bond, the compound has a higher chance of being BBBP.
Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-NHC(=O)NH-" or "-C(=O)NNC(=O)-" in a compound indicates that it might have the property of being Blood-Brain Barrier Penetrating (BBBP). 
Rule 2: A molecule with a benzene ring in the structure; if not conjugated with any other functional groups, stands a high chance of being BBBP. However, the presence of two or more unlinked benzene rings or a benzene ring in a compound already containing a sulfonyl group connected to an aromatic ring, may indicate that it is not BBBP.
Rule 3: Compounds that contain a sodium ion, a chloride ion or a bromine atom are unlikely to be BBBP due to their potential toxicity. 
Rule 4: If the compound has a structure similar to that of known BBBP molecules, it might potentially be BBBP but requires careful analysis and extensive testing.
Rule 5: The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle along with one or more benzene rings indicates a low probability for the compound to be BBBP.
Rule 6: The presence of sulfonyl group (-SO2R) in the compound, especially if not linked to an aromatic ring, suggests potential BBBP property. However, if the sulfonyl group is attached to an aromatic ring, the compound may not be BBBP.
