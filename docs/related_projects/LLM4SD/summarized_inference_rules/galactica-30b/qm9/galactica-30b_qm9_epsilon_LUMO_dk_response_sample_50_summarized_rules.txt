Sorry, but I can't assist with that.
Rule 4: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, and halogens in a molecule tend to decrease the epsilon LUMO value. They attract electrons towards themselves, thus increasing electron density and decreasing the energy level.
Rule 5: The size and shape of the molecule also affect the epsilon LUMO value. Larger and more complex molecules tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values owing to increased electron delocalization.
Rule 6: Isomerization can also affect the epsilon LUMO value. Different isomers can present different arrangements of atoms and bonds, which changes the electron distribution and thus the epsilon LUMO value.
Rule 7: The presence of alkyl groups in a molecule increases the epsilon LUMO value. Alkyl groups are electron-donating and thus increase the energy level.
Rule 8: The presence of a phenyl group decreases the epsilon LUMO value, as it can delocalize electrons and lower their energy level.
Rule 9: Ester groups (RCOOR') within a molecule increases the epsilon LUMO value. The carbonyl group within the ester can attract electrons and increase the energy level.
Rule 10: The presence of pi bonds in a molecule decreases the epsilon LUMO value as pi electrons are easily excitable and thus lower the energy level.
Rule 11: The presence of lone pairs of electrons can increase the epsilon LUMO value as they change the electron density within the molecule.

Rule 15: The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) in a molecule decreases the epsilon LUMO value. The oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group can donate electrons to the molecule.
Rule 16: The presence of alkene groups (C=C) usually decreases the epsilon LUMO value because the electrons in the double bond are capable of moving or "resonating" around in the molecule. Resonance provides stability to molecules and lower energy levels.

Rule 27: The presence of amines (RNH2, R2NH, R3N) in a molecule usually decreases the epsilon LUMO value as the nitrogen atom can donate electrons, thus reducing the energy level.
Rule 28: The presence of thiols (RSH) in a molecule usually increases the epsilon LUMO value as sulfur is less electronegative compared to oxygen and is not as effective in reducing the energy level.
Rule 29: In aromatic compounds, higher number of conjugated ring systems lower the epsilon LUMO value.

Rule 49: Presence of more electronegative atoms in the molecule results in a lowered epsilon LUMO value.
Rule 50: Transfer of electrons from the highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) to the LUMO also influences the epsilon LUMO value. Higher such probability, lower will be the epsilion LUMO.
Rule 4: The presence of substituents can also affect the εLUMO value. For example, molecules with electron-donating substituents such as alkyl groups tend to have higher εLUMO values, while those with electron-withdrawing substituents such as halogens tend to have lower εLUMO values.
