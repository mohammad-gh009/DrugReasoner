Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or similar functional groups, it could potentially cause cardiac disorders. 
Rule 2: Presence of functional groups such as OP(=O)(O)[O-] or CNC1(CCCCC1=O)C2=CC=CC=C2Cl may increase the potential for cardiac disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains functional group such as CN(C)CCC=C1C2=CC=CC=C2COC3=C1C=C(C=C3)CC(=O)O.Cl or CC1=CC(=C(C=C1)SC2=CC=CC=C2N3CCNCC3)C, it may not cause cardiac disorders.
Rule 4: The existence of a nitro group (-NO2) or sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in a molecule can cause cardiotoxicity.
Rule 5: Molecules with a larger surface area or flexible structures may have higher toxicity potential due to better accessibility to target sites.
Rule 6: Stereochemistry of a molecule plays a role in its toxicity, different chiral forms may exhibit varied activities and hence effects.
Rule 7: Presence of a sulfonyl group (SO2R) could increase the probability of a molecule causing cardiac disorders.
Rule 8: Molecules with a benzenesulfonamide part (C6H5SO2NH) may also have higher probabilities for causing cardiac disorders.
Rule 9: Absence of functional groups or structural features associated with cardiotoxicity in a compound results in lesser likelihood of causing cardiac disorders.
Rule 10: Molecules containing "-COOH" or "-OH" functional groups are more likely to cause adverse effects on the heart. 
Rule 11: Molecules with a benzene ring may have a higher possibility of causing heart adverse effects. 
Rule 12: Molecules with a long chain of carbon atoms may have a lesser risk of causing heart adverse effects.
Rule 13: Functional groups like amides and sulfonamides can increase a compound's potential for causing heart issues.
Rule 14: Negative ions or atoms present in a compound may decrease its potential to cause heart issues. 
Rule 15: Aromatic rings in a compound can increase its potential to cause heart issues.
Rule 16: The presence of fluorine atoms or a nitro group in the structure of a molecule can cause cardiovascular disorder.
Rule 17: The presence of a double bond between carbon atoms or a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms may increase the likelihood of cardiac disorders.
Rule 18: Presence of strontium ions in a molecule may decrease its potential to cause cardiac disorders.
Rule 1: Molecules with a phosphorus atom bonded to four oxygen atoms in a cyclic structure may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
Rule 2: Molecules with a nitrogen-containing ring structure connected to a carbonyl group through a carbon-carbon bond may not have the potential to cause cardiac disorders.
Rule 3: Molecules that contain a thallium or chlorine atom may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
Rule 4: A molecule that contains any metal ion in its structure, such as gadolinium, is highly likely to cause adverse effects on the heart.
Rule 5: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) or a sulfate group (-OSO3-) may have a potential risk of causing cardiovascular diseases.
Rule 6: Molecules with a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring may have a potential risk of causing adverse effects on the heart.
Rule 7: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is likely to have side effects associated with cardiac disorders.
Rule 8: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have side-effects associated with cardiac disorders.
Rule 9: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it may have side-effects associated with cardiac disorders.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), it may have the potential to cause cardiac disorders.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to an aromatic ring, it may also have the potential to cause cardiac disorders.
Rule 12: Molecules containing a benzimidazole moiety (a fused benzene and imidazole ring system) may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
