Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), halogen atom (like chlorine), a nitro group (-NO2), or a functional group such as "CCOO" or "CCON", it could have the potential to cause adverse effects during medical procedures.
Rule 2: The molecular structure, length of the carbon chain and size can impact the toxicity of a compound. Longer chains can disrupt cell membranes affecting toxicity and thus, potential for adverse effects during surgery or medical procedures.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule, including the presence of a chiral center, can influence its toxicity. Different enantiomers of a molecule can have different biological activities and thus, potential for adverse effects.
Rule 4: Molecules with conjugated double bonds, aromatic rings, and/or nonpolar functional groups, may increase the potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 5: Molecules with polar functional groups like carboxylic acid (-COOH), primary amine (-NH2), or secondary amide (-CONHR) could have lower risks of causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of certain functional groups like nitrile, carbonyl, carboxyl, and cyano groups, as well as complex ring structures or multiple conjugated double bonds, aromatic rings, or halogen atoms, could increase the risk of adverse effects during medical procedures. 
Rule 7: The presence of a metal ion such as silver, gadolinium, calcium or gallium in a molecule may increase the potential for adverse effects during medical procedures.
Rule 8: The presence of a conjugated system of double bonds between carbon atoms, a nitro group (-NO2) connected to a carbonyl group (-C=O) or a phosphorus atom bonded to four oxygen atoms, may indicate potential for side effects during medical procedures.
Rule 9: Molecules containing a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms in its structure, a sulfur atom bonded to one carbon atom and one oxygen atom in its structure, or a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, could potentially cause adverse effects during medical procedures. 
Rule 10: Molecules containing a chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring, a phosphorus atom bonded to two oxygen atoms through a double bond, or a nitrogen atom connected to a carbon atom via a triple bond, could potentially cause side effects in medical procedures.
Rule 1: The presence of a "nitro" (-NO2) functional group in a molecule indicates potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 2: The presence of a "carbonyl" (-C=O) functional group in a molecule could also lead to potential adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 3: The presence of a benzene ring (-C6H5) in a molecule could also potentially lead to adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 4: The presence of functional groups such as a cyano group (-CN) in a molecule may lead to adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 5: The absence of specific functional groups in a molecule could decrease its potential of causing adverse effects.
Rule 6: The length, complexity, and charge distribution of a molecule can affect its ability to cause adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a sulfonate group (-SO3H-), it may have side effects during medical procedures.
Rule 8: Certain structural features such as double bonds, triple bonds, and aromatic rings increase the potential toxicity of a molecule.
Rule 9: The presence of a halogen atom like chlorine in a molecule increases the reactivity and potential for causing side effects.
Rule 10: Molecules with multiple rings or conjugated systems are more likely to cause adverse effects due to their ability to interact with other molecules.
Rule 11: Molecules having a functional group that reacts with proteins or enzymes pose a higher risk of adverse effects.
Rule 12: Molecules containing a sulfonamide group are expected to have potential side effects.
Rule 13: The presence of a halogen atom (like chlorine or fluorine) in a molecule, attached to a carbon atom, increases the chances of side effects.
Rule 14: A molecule containing both a sulfonamide group and a nitro group could increase the severity of side effects.
Rule 15: A molecule with a functional group containing halogens should be thoroughly evaluated for safety before use.
