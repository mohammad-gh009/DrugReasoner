Rule 1: Molecules containing nitro group (-NO2) or sulfonyl group (-SO2R) may have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F) may also have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a heterocyclic ring system may also have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: Molecules containing a conjugated system of double bonds or aromatic rings may have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide or nitro group in the structure of a molecule may lead to potential adverse effects.
Rule 7: Molecules containing halogen atoms like chlorine and fluorine, may increase its likelihood to cause potential adverse effects.
Rule 8: A high degree of conjugation between multiple double bonds may increase the reactivity of molecules resulting in potential adverse effects.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a sulfate group (-OSO3-), it may have potential adverse effects.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains nitro group (-NO2) or a nitrile group (-CN), it may have potential to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 11: Presence of cyano group (-CN), or a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule may have potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: The presence of certain functional groups like a nitro group (-NO2) or sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a large molecular size or high charge and polarity may have potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a bromine atom, thiophene ring, or a nitro group, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 1: Molecules containing a functional group like a carbonyl group or a double bond between carbon atoms have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules with a functional group such as "CCON" or "CCS" could potentially cause adverse effects due to their common occurrence in drugs associated with side effects.
Rule 3: Molecules incorporating a halogen atom, such as chlorine or fluorine, could potentially cause adverse effects, increasing the likelihood of side effects despite their frequent use in drug design for modifying chemical properties.
Rule 4: Molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) hold the potential to cause adverse effects, as nitro compounds are known for their toxicity and possible serious health hazards.
Rule 5: Molecules which contain a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 6: Molecules having both a sulfonamide group and a nitro group may pose a more significant potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 7: Molecules containing functional groups like C-Cl or N-Cl in their structure may result in potential toxicity and adverse effects on human health, making the compound more reactive.
Rule 8: Aromatic rings, especially those with electron withdrawing substituents like -COOH, -CHO, in the molecular structure may increase the compound's reactivity, making it susceptible to oxidative stress and cellular damage.
Rule 9: Molecules with multiple bonds, particularly double bonds, between carbon atoms may enhance the lipophilicity of the compound, allowing it to affect cellular processes.
Rule 10: Molecules containing a bromine atom have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 11: Molecules containing a thiophene ring have the potential to cause adverse effects due to the toxic properties of the sulfur atom in the ring.
