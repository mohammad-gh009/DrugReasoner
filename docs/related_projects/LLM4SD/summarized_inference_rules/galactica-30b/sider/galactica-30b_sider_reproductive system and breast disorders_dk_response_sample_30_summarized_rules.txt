Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a conjugated system such as alternating double bonds and single bonds, then it may also have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom like fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, then it may not have any significant side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders.
Rule 5: If the molecule contains a functional group such as "CC(C)NO" or "CCON" in its structure, then it may have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. 
Rule 6: If the molecule contains the substructure "C1=CC=C2C(=C1)C=NN=C2NN" or "C(CC(C(F)F)(C(=O)O)N)CN", then it may have side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders.
Rule 7: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it may have side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders.
Rule 8: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (-C6H5), then it may have potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders.
Rule 9: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders.
Rule 10: If the molecule contains a guanidine group (-NH-C(=NH)-NH-) or a urea group (-NH-C(=O)-NH-), then it may have potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders.
Rule 11: If the molecule contains a sodium ion (Na+) or a manganese ion (Mn+2) in its structure, then it may have potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders.
Rule 12: If the molecule contains a phosphate group (PO4âˆ’3), then it may also have potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders.
Rule 13: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H6) or a naphthalene ring (C10H8), then it may also have potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders.
Rule 14: Compounds containing aromatic rings like benzene or naphthalene may be associated with reproductive system and breast disorders.
Rule 15: If the molecule contains a functional group such as CC(=O) or C#N, then it may have side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. 
Rule 16: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects on the reproductive system or breast tissue. 
Rule 17: Longer and more complex molecules tend to have higher chances of interacting with other molecules in the body and causing adverse effects. 
Rule 18: A molecule may contain a nitro group (-NO2) or other reactive functional groups like -SCN, -SO2NH2 etc. may have potential toxic effects due to their ability to bind with proteins and enzymes.
Rule 19: Molecules containing metal ions like zinc, gadolinium etc. may also exhibit certain biological activities but they should not be considered as potential drugs unless proven otherwise. 
Rule 20: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it may have side effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders. 
Rule 21: If molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a benzene ring (-C6H5), then it may have potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains the substructure "CCON" or "CCNS", then it may be associated with potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (represented by the SMILES string "c1ccccc1" or "c1cc2ccc(cc2c1)"), then its potential for causing side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders increases.
