Rule 1: Molecules that contain a phosphorus atom bonded to two carbon atoms in a ring might have negative health impacts including infections and infestations. 
Rule 2: Molecules with a sulfur atom bonded to an oxygen atom and a carbon atom may have potential side effects connected to infections. 
Rule 3: A gold atom in a molecular structure could cause toxicity, leading to health issues such as kidney damage and neurological disorders.
Rule 4: If a molecule includes a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), it's likely to cause side effects related to infections.
Rule 5: Molecules that contain a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom next to a double bond might also exhibit side effects linked with infections. 
Rule 6: Molecules with a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to a nitrogen atom via two single bonds may not have side effects linked to infections and infestations. 
Rule 7: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a compound raises the chances of adverse effects.
Rule 8: Molecules containing benzene rings, especially with electron-withdrawing groups such as -COOH, -CHO, or -NO2, could prompt adverse effects.
Rule 9: Compounds with a long carbon chain or multiple rings have the potential to accumulate in the body over time, leading to possible toxicity.
Rule 10: Molecules with a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) may have infections and infestations related side effects.
Rule 11: If the molecular structure has a conjugated system of double bonds, it could cause potential side effects.
Rule 12: If a halogen atom is attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group in the molecular structure, it could lead to side effects associated with infections. 
Rule 13: A molecule featuring both a sulfonamide group and a nitro group is more likely to have side effects related to infections and infestations.
Rule 14: Certain functional groups, including nitro groups and halogens in a molecule, may indicate a high likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 15: Molecules with a planar structure tend to increase bioavailability and toxicity, whereas those with a non-planar structure may be less likely to do so.
Rule 16: Larger molecules, which tend to be more hydrophobic, can accumulate in tissues and potentially lead to toxicity.
Rule 17: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom in a cyclic structure, it could potentially cause side effects related to infections. 
Rule 18: If the molecule contains a thiocyanate group (-SCN) or a cyanate ion (OCN-), it may not have any significant side effects on infections and infestations. 
Rule 19: If a molecule has a five-membered ring structure with one double bond, it could have potential side effects related to infections. 
Rule 20: Certain structural features like a sulfonamide group or a nitrate ion in a compound increase its likelihood of causing side effects on infections and infestations.
Rule 21: A carbonyl group in conjunction with a double bond or an aromatic ring in a molecule indicates a probability of causing side effects related to infections.
Rule 22: A bromine atom adjacent to a hydroxyl group in the ortho position in a molecule implies possible side effects related to infections.
Rule 23: Molecules with a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring might also potentially induce side effects related to infections. 
Rule 24: A nitrile group next to an aromatic ring in a molecule may cause side effects related to infections and infestations.
Rule 25: The presence of functional groups like "-NO2" or "-COOH" can lead to adverse effects in humans. On the other hand, certain groups like phenyl (-C6H5) or sulfonamide (-SO2NH2) may also lead to health hazards including skin rashes or liver damage.
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in specific structured compounds, it may have potential side effects related to infections and infestations.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains two carbonyl groups connected by a single bond in given structured compounds, it may have potential side effects related to infections and infestations.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom in specific structured compounds it may have potential side effects related to infections and infestations.
Rule 4: If the molecular formula contains iron atoms or calcium ions, it has no relation to infection and infestation activities.
Rule 5: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) in its structure, it may have potential for causing adverse effects related to infections and infestations.
Rule 6: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom, it may have potential for causing adverse effects related to infections and infestations.
Rule 7: If there exists a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecular structure, it may lead to adverse effects.
Rule 8: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, especially if it is substituted with electron-withdrawing groups such as -COOH, -CHO, or -NO2, it may have adverse effects.
Rule 9: If the molecule has a long carbon chain or multiple rings, it may have poor solubility in water and may accumulate in the body over time, leading to potential toxicity.
Rule 10: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have side effects associated with infections and infestations.
Rule 11: If the molecular structure contains a conjugated system of double bonds, it may be more likely to have side effects due to its reactivity.
Rule 12: If the molecular structure contains a halogen atom, such as chlorine or fluorine, attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group, it may have side effects associated with infections and infestations.
