Rule 1: The presence of a functional group such as "-COOH" or "-SO3H" in the molecular structure can lead to adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 2: A heterocyclic ring, especially those containing nitrogen atoms like pyridine or pyrimidine, in the molecular structure can contribute to adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 3: Multiple aromatic rings connected by conjugated double bonds in the molecular structure may increase the molecule's ability to penetrate cell membranes, potentially causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 4: The existence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecular structure may lead the molecule to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 5: The presence of a benzene ring with attached chlorine atoms in a molecule may result in adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 6: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to two carbon atoms, which are also bonded to each other through another single bond, indicates potential toxicity towards the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 7: The molecular structure containing a nitrogen atom bonded to four different carbon atoms, at least one of which is also bonded to a hydrogen atom, indicates the potential to cause adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it has the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 9: A molecule with a benzene ring in its structure has a high chance of causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 10: A molecule containing a sulfonamide group in its structure can interfere with folic acid metabolism, leading to potential health problems.
Rule 11: Molecules containing a nitro functional group can potentially trigger allergic reactions, causing adverse effects on blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 1: The presence of a functional group such as "CC(=O)NSCC1CNN(C(=O)O1)C2=CC(=C(C=C2)N3CCOCC3)F" or "C[C@]12CC[C@H]3[C@H]([C@@H]1CC[C@@H]2O)[C@@H](CC4=C3C=CC(=C4)O)CCCCCCCCCS(=O)CCCC(C(F)(F)F)(F)F" in a compound indicates a high probability of causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 2: A compound with a halogen atom like chlorine in its structure, noted as "C1=C(C(=C(C(=C1Cl)Cl)CC2=C(C(=CC(=C2Cl)Cl)Cl)O)O)Cl", likely won't significantly impact the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 3: Compounds with sodium and iron metal ions can potentially lead to adverse reactions in the body due to their toxicity.
Rule 4: Molecules containing a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) have the potential to cause adverse effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders.
Rule 5: Molecules containing a chlorine atom attached to the carbon, nitrogen atom bonded to four other atoms (two carbon atoms, one oxygen atom, one hydrogen atom) or benzene ring structure have the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems. 
Rule 6: Presence of halogen atoms such as bromine or chlorine in the molecular structure increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 7: Presence of multiple double bonds between carbon atoms in the molecular structure also increases the likelihood of adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 8: Presence of certain functional groups like sulfonyl groups or nitro groups decreases the likelihood of causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems.
