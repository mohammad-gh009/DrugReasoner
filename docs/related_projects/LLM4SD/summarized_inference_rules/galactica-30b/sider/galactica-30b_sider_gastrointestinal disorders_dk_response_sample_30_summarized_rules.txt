Rule 1: If a molecule contains "nitrile" (-CN) or "isocyanate" (-N=C=O) functional groups, or a halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, or a benzene ring (C6H5) or a naphthalene ring (C10H8), it may potentially cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 2: Compounds with a high degree of lipophilicity or functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups can increase the potential for causing adverse gastrointestinal effects due to their ability to irritate the stomach lining or remain in the body for a prolonged period.
Rule 3: Molecules with large molecular weight (greater than 500 Daltons) may have difficulty penetrating cell membranes, potentially limiting their bioavailability and toxicity.
Rule 4: Harmful functional groups like "-CN", "-NO2", sulfonamide, or long carbon chains attached to multiple rings in the molecular structure can lead to adverse effects.
Rule 5: The presence of iron atoms, oxygen molecules, zinc atoms, iodine atoms, or specific functional groups such as carbonyl groups, carboxyl groups, or sulfonyl groups may potentially cause gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 6: Compounds containing a sulfonamide group, carboxylic acid group alongside an amide group, and a benzene ring or nitro group, could potentially cause gastrointestinal problems.
Rule 7: The presence of a conjugated system of double bonds, a high degree of symmetry, or specific ions (such as barium or silver) may suggest potential for adverse health effects.
Rule 8: The presence of negatively charged atoms such as oxygen and nitrogen, functional groups like sulfonates or phosphates, large molecular surface area or non-planar structure, or specific enantiomer can increase the potential for causing gastrointestinal disorders. 
Rule 9: Compounds with sodium ions, high lipophilicity, or multiple halogen atoms may potentially cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: Stereotypic features such as aromatic rings, conjugated double bonds, heterocyclic systems, long alkyl chains, or halogens can impact a compound's potential to cause adverse effects due to their high reactivity, ability to interact with biological targets, or accumulation in tissues.
Rule 1: A molecule with either "-CN" or "-NO2" functional group in its structure may result in harmful effects on the human body. This is applicable for molecules with SMILES strings from line number 7 onwards. Such molecules can potentially cause gastric problems.
 
Rule 2: Molecules with long carbon chains containing multiple rings may have potential adverse effects due to high lipophilicity. This applies to molecules with SMILES strings from line number 9 onwards. These molecules have a higher probability of being toxic.

Rule 3: Molecules with a sulfonamide group can cause adverse reactions such as skin rashes, fevers and allergic responses. This rule pertains to molecules with SMILES strings starting from line number 18 onwards. These molecules can be highly allergenic.

Rule 4: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) may potentially cause gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to the molecules numbered from 6 to 65.
