Rule 8: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a benzene ring (-C6H5) or a cyano group (-CN) and a pyridine ring (-C5H5N), it may adverse effects related to immune system disorders.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (like fluorine or chlorine) attached to a carbon atom, it may not have the potential to cause any adverse effects.
Rule 10: For a molecule, the structure and geometry, size and polarity, and presence of specific chemical bonds or structural motifs can influence its potential to cause adverse effects on the immune system.
Rule 11: Molecules containing functional groups like carbonyl group (C=O), amide group (-CONH-), halogen atoms, and long complex structure may lead to adverse effects. 
Rule 12: The presence of functional groups like sulfonyl, carbonyl, and carboxylic acid or containing multiple rings/aromatic systems in a compound may increase the possibility of causing adverse effects.

Rule 14: A molecule containing a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) could be related to immune system disorders.
Rule 15: A molecule containing a substructure such as "CCS(=O)(=O)O", "CCCC1OC2CC3C4CCC5=CC(=O)C=CC5", or "COC1=CC2=C(C=CN=C2C=C1OC)OC3=CC=C(C=C3)NC(=O)C4(CC4)C(=O)NC5=CC=C(C=C5)F" may have potential to cause immune system disorders.
Rule 16: The presence of sulfur, compounds containing conjugated double or aromatic bonds, and presence of certain functional groups like nitro groups, sulfonyl groups can increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system.
Rule 17: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), a cyano group (-CN) and a benzene ring (-C6H5), a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 18: If the molecule contains a bromine atom and a benzene ring, a chlorine atom, a carbonyl group, and a cyclopropane ring, or contains a sulfur atom, a nitrogen atom, and a conjugated double bond system, it could indicate side-effects related to immune system disorders.
Rule 19: If a molecule contains a nitro group or a halogen atom (like chlorine or fluorine), coupled with its molecular structure, size, and specific chemical bonds or structural motifs, it could indicate potential adverse effects on the immune system.
Rule 20: If the molecule contains a cyano group and a benzene ring, a nitro group and a pyridine ring, or two amide groups connected by a single bond, it indicates potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system.
Rule 1: Molecules that contain sulfonyl, carbonyl, sulfonamide, or nitro groups have potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders.
Rule 2: Molecules that contain phosphorus atoms bonded to four carbon atoms, chlorinated phenol group, halogen atoms, or a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring may also pose potential to cause adverse effects on the immune system.
Rule 3: Molecules containing gold atoms or charged functional groups such as ammonium ions or carboxylate anions may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders.
Rule 4: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure, presence of multiple aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also influence the potential toxicity of a compound.
Rule 5: The presence of specific structural features in a molecule may affect its ability to bind to receptors and enzymes involved in various physiological processes. For example, presence of aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds can increase its affinity towards certain receptors and enzymes.
Rule 6: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group along with a benzene ring or a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group or a nitro group along with a pyridine ring, then the molecule has potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders.
Rule 7: The presence of a thiadiazole ring or a benzene ring or a sulfhydryl group (SH) or a disulfide bond (SS) in a molecule can indicate adverse effects due to their ability to interact with biological receptors and disrupt the normal cellular processes.
Rule 8: If a molecule contains a cyano group, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders.
Rule 9: The presence of functional groups such as "-COOH" or "-OH" in a molecule may cause adverse effects due to its ability to bind to proteins and disrupt their function.
Rule 10: The presence of heterocyclic ring system such as pyridine or pyrimidine or metal ions such as zinc or sodium may affect their overall toxicity.
