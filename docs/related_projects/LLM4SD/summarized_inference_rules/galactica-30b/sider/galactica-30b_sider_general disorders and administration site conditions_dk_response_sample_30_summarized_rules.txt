Rule 2: If a compound has a polar surface area greater than 70 Å^2, then it may have side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects in general disorders and administration site conditions.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a nitrogen-containing ring system, such as a pyridine or pyrimidine ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in general disorders and administration site conditions.
Rule 6: If there is a presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide or nitro group in the molecular structure, it may lead to adverse effects on the human body.
Rule 7: If the molecular weight of a compound is high, it may indicate that the compound has a larger size and more complex structure, which could potentially increase its toxicity. 
Rule 8: The presence of certain atoms or bonds in a molecule may affect its potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 9: If the presence of functional group like "-COOH" or "-OH" in the structure of a molecule, it has high probability of causing adverse effects due to its ability to bind to proteins and disrupt their function.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may cause adverse effects such as methemoglobinemia, hemolytic anemia, and cyanosis.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a heterocyclic ring system, it may cause adverse effects by binding to receptors and disrupting their normal functioning.

Rule 13: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, nitro, and halogen groups in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 14: A molecule containing multiple rings or fused ring systems may also increase its potential for causing adverse effects due to increased steric hindrance and reduced flexibility.
Rule 15: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure may also play a role in determining its potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 16: The presence of functional groups such as nitro groups or halogen groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 17: A compound containing aromatic rings may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects due to their planar structure and ability to interact with biological molecules through π-π stacking interactions.
Rule 18: Compounds with high molecular weight or complex structures may have a greater risk of causing adverse effects due to their increased hydrophobicity and potential for interacting with multiple targets within the body.
Rule 19: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide or nitro group in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 20: A molecule containing multiple rings or aromatic systems may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects due to their ability to bind strongly to proteins and enzymes.
Rule 21: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound can affect its absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity profile. Molecules with high molecular weights and hydrophobicities tend to be less soluble and more likely to accumulate in tissues, leading to potential toxic effects. 
Rule 22: If there is a presence of functional group like "Cl" or "Br" in the structure of the molecule, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects under general disorders and administration site conditions. 
Rule 23: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) or sulfonyl group (SO2R) in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 24: A molecule containing aromatic rings or a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (-C=O) may have a higher chance of causing adverse effects.
Rule 25: If the presence of a guanidine group (-C(=NH)NH2) in the molecular structure, it may cause side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Rule 26: If a compound contains a functional group such as carbonyl (C=O), it may cause adverse effects if it is part of a larger ring structure.
Rule 27: If a compound contains a sulfhydryl (SH) group, it may also cause adverse effects due to its ability to bind to proteins and disrupt their function.
Rule 1: Molecules bearing functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) or sulfonyl group (SO2R) tend to increase the likelihood of adverse effects.
Rule 2: Presence of nitro group or sulfonamide in the molecular structure can potentially lead to adverse effects. 
Rule 3: If the molecular weight of a compound is more than 500 Daltons, it increases the chances of causing adverse effects. 
Rule 4: Multiple rings in a molecule's structure are more likely to cause adverse effects due to increased interaction with biological systems. 
Rule 5: Increased length and complexity of a molecule may lead to higher flexibility, higher propensity to interact with biological systems, and thus potentially higher adverse effects. 
Rule 6: Stereochemistry plays a significant role in determining potency and efficacy of a molecule, as different isomers can have varying physical and chemical properties affecting receptor or enzyme interactions. 
Rule 7: Compounds containing a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2) can lead to side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Rule 8: A compound with a polar surface area greater than 70 Å^2 can potentially lead to side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions. 
Rule 9: Presence of a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine) attached to an aromatic ring increases the chance of side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions. 
Rule 10: Presence of functional groups such as "-COOH" or "-OH" in a molecular structure can contribute to adverse effects due to the formation of hydrogen bonds with other body molecules. 
Rule 11: Multiple ring systems or aromatic structures within a molecule can increase the possibility of adverse effects through increased interaction with biological receptors. 
Rule 12: Presence of a charged atom like sodium or strontium in the molecular structure can potentially lead to adverse effects due to disruption of ionic balance within cells.
