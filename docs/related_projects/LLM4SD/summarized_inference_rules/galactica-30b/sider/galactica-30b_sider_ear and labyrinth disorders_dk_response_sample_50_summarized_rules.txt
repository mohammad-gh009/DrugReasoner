Rule 10: Compounds containing nitrogen atoms bonded to three carbon atoms in a ring structure may not have side effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. 
Rule 11: For benzene ring molecules connected to a cyclopentane ring through a carbonyl group, they may potentially cause ear and labyrinth disorders. 
Rule 12: Molecules containing a chlorine atom (-Cl) may not necessarily provoke adverse effects linked to ear and labyrinth disorders. 
Rule 13: Benzene rings or naphthalene rings in molecules might contribute to potential ear and labyrinth disorders owing to their toxicity through biological interaction.
Rule 14: Fluorine atoms attached to a benzene ring in a molecule suggest potential toxicity leading to ear and labyrinth disorders. 
Rule 15: Molecules with a conjugated system of double bonds might also lead to potential adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders.
Rule 1: If a compound contains a benzene ring or a similar aromatic system, it may lead to side effects on the ears and labyrinth organs. This rule applies to certain molecules with specified chemical structures.
Rule 2: Compounds with functional groups like -COOH or -CONH- could affect the blood circulation causing negative reactions in certain body parts including the ears and labyrinth organs.
Rule 3: Compounds containing a heterocyclic ring structure with nitrogen atoms may have potential side effects on the ears and labyrinth organs.
Rule 4: Compounds that have sulfur in the molecular structure could lead to adverse effects on ears or labyrinths.
Rule 5: Molecules that contain a conjugated system of double bonds might contribute to adverse effects on ears or labyrinths by reducing its reactivity towards biological systems. 
Rule 6: Presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule could cause adverse effects on ears or labyrinths due to its strong oxidizing property.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, it indicates potential for causing adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders.
Rule 8: Molecules with a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring might cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders.
Rule 9: Molecules with a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) indicates potential for causing adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a nitrogen atom, it may potentially cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. 
Rule 11: The presence of functional groups like sulfonyl, carbonyl and nitro groups, halogen atoms like fluorine or chlorine and a heterocyclic ring structure in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on ears and labyrinths.
Rule 12: If the molecule contains a silver ion (Ag+) or a sodium ion (Na+), it may potentially cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders.
Rule 13: Molecules that contain a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2) are indicative of potential ear and labyrinth disorders.
Rule 14: If a compound contains a chlorine atom or a bromine atom, this could indicate potential adverse effects on the ear and labyrinth. 
Rule 15: Compounds containing functional groups like carbonyl or carboxyl groups might lead to adverse effects in the ear and labyrinth system.
Rule 16: Molecules with a conjugated double bond system could cause potential adverse effects on the ear and labyrinth system.
Rule 17: Compounds that contain halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine may potentially cause adverse effects on the ear and labyrinth system.
Rule 1: If a molecule includes a chlorine atom attached to a phenyl ring, it can potentially cause ear and labyrinth disorders. Applicable to molecules marked as "1" in the dataset. 

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a guanidine group (-CN3), it can potentially cause ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule applies to molecules tagged as "1" in the dataset.

Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is unlikely to cause ear and labyrinth disorders. This applies to molecules tagged as "0" in the dataset.
