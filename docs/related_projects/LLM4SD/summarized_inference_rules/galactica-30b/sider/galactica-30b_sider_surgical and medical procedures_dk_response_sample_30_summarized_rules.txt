Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may cause side effects or adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may potentially cause side effects or adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains both a sulfonamide group and a nitro group, it may have more severe side effects or adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (-Cl), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 5: If the molecule contains a functional group such as "CCOO" or "CCON", then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 6: If the molecule contains a metal ion such as silver, gadolinium, chromium, selenium, sodium, iron, or manganese, it may cause side effects during surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 7: If the molecule has a cyano group (-C#N) or a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in conjugation with an alkene, it may have side effects during surgical or medical procedures. 
Rule 8: The presence of certain functional groups like sulfonyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, and cyano or complex ring structures or multiple conjugated double bonds may increase the molecule's risk of causing adverse effects during surgical procedures.
Rule 9: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a conjugated system of double bonds between carbon atoms, it may have potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 10: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in the position para to another aromatic ring or a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an amide group (-CONH-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. 
Rule 11: If the molecule contains the substructure C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N, it may have side effects during surgical or medical procedures. 
Rule 12: If the molecule contains a functional group called "nitrile" (-CN), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 13: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have side effects during medical procedures.
Rule 14: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbonyl group (-C=O) and another nitrogen atom, it may have side effects during surgery or medical procedures.
Rule 15: If the molecule contains a functional group called "carbonyl" (-C=O), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 16: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) or halogen atoms like fluorine (-F) in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects during surgical and medical procedures. 
Rule 17: If the molecule contains a metal ion such as gallium (Ga) or gadolinium (Gd), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 1: If the molecule structure contains a chlorine atom, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures due to the increased reactivity it brings about in molecules.
Rule 2: Any molecule that contains multiple rings or conjugated systems could possibly be associated with an increased risk of adverse effects, owing to their ability to interact with other molecules within the body.
Rule 3: Functional groups known to react with proteins or enzymes can pose higher risks of inducing adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. Specifically, molecules containing nitro groups are mentioned as examples of risky functional groups.
Rule 4: The inclusion of "CCOO" or "CCON" functional groups in the structure of the molecule may lead to potential adverse effects in medical or surgical procedures.
Rule 5: A molecule containing a metal ion, such as silver or gadolinium, may potentially cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 6: A molecule containing a nitro group has a potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 7: If a molecule has a sulfonamide group, it could potentially cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 8: The presence of a furan ring in the molecule implies a risk of causing adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 9: Molecules with two identical functional groups connected through a double bond can potentially cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. However, this rule calls for caution as other factors may also contribute to the effects.
