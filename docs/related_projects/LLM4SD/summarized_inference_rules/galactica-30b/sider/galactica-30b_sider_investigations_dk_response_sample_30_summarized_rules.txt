Rule 20: Molecules that contain cyano groups (-CN) attached to benzene rings are likely to cause side effects.
Rule 21: Molecules containing a carboxylate ion (-COO-) are less likely to have side effects.
Rule 22: The presence of a guanidine group (-C(=NH)NH2) in a molecule suggests possible side effects. 
Rule 23: The molecule's potential for adverse effects increases if its structure contains a functional group like carbonyl or carboxyl.
Rule 24: High molecular weight and hydrophobicity in a molecule can lead to increased risk of adverse effects.
Rule 25: Potential adverse effects may occur if molecules possess halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine.

Rule 34: Potential side effects may be higher if the molecule comprises aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds.  
Rule 35: Molecules with functional groups "CCON" and "CCCN" are likely to have potential side effects.
Rule 36: Molecules containing halogen atoms like chlorine or fluorine are potentially harmful. 
Rule 37: Presence of a sulfonyl group (SO2R) and a nitro group (NO2) in a molecule may make it potentially harmful.
