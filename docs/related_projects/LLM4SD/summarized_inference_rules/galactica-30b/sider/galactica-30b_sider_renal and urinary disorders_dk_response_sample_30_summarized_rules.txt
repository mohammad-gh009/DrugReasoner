Rule 1: Molecules containing functional groups like carbonyl group (C=O), carboxylic acid group (COOH), "C(C=O)C(C=O)O", "CC(C)C1=NC(=CS1)CN(C)C(=O)NC(CCN2CCOCC2)C(=O)NC(CCC(CC3=CC=CC=C3)NC(=O)OCC4=CN=CS4)CC5=CC=CC=C5", "CC(=O)[C@]1(CC[C@@H]2[C@@]1(CC[C@H]3[C@H]2CCC4=CC(=O)CC[C@]34C)C)O", "CC1=C(C(=CC=C1)C)NC(=O)C2CCCCN2C", "C(C(CO)O)O", "CC(=O)NC1=C(C(=C(C(=C1, or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) or a phosphate group (-OPO3R2) could potentially cause adverse renal and urinary effects.
Rule 2: Presence of a nitrogen atom bonded to at least two carbon atoms or when nitrogen atom is bonded to four other atoms, including two carbon atoms and two hydrogen atoms might result in adverse renal and urinary effects. Also, adverse effects can be caused if the molecule contains a functional group like amides, ureas, aromatic rings, nitro or amino groups, sulfonamides, and nitro groups.
Rule 3: Adverse renal and urinary effects could be triggered by molecules containing chlorine atom (Cl), a sodium ion (Na+) and an iodide ion (I-), and halogens like fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. Similarly, molecules bearing a functional group like "C(C(CO)O)O" or "CC(=O)NC1=C(C(=C(C(=C1", a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), a nitro group (-NO2), a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, a negative charge at physiological pH, a sulfhydryl group (-SH), a fluoro group (-F) attached to a phenyl ring, and halogen atoms. 
Rule 4: Adverse effects on the renal and urinary systems could be caused by molecules having aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds, a high degree of polarity or hydrophilicity, conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings, a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to an aromatic ring or carbon chain, benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (-C=O) through a single bond, carbonyl group (-C=O) adjacent to a double bond or triple bond, a sulfonyl group (-SO2NH2), halogen atoms attached to a benzene ring, a cyano group (-CN), and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) connected to a carbon chain.
Rule 5: Molecules with longer chain lengths and more complex structures, a high degree of conjugation, large and complex molecules, a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) conjugated with an alkene or alkyne group, large molecular weights and hydrophobicities could cause potential adverse renal and urinary effects.
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom via a double or triple bond, it might potentially cause renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 2: If a nitrogen atom in the molecule is bonded to four other atoms, comprising of two carbon atoms and two hydrogen atoms, the molecule may potentially cause renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom connected to a carbon atom through a single bond, with at least one non-aromatic ring of five or six atoms, it may indicate potential for renal and urinary disorders.

Rule 4: The presence of a halogen, in particular a chlorine atom, in a molecule's structure calls for caution due to potential risks associated with renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 5: Conjugated systems of double bonds can enhance a molecule's reactivity, thereby increasing the risk of renal and urinary disorders. 
Rule 6: The presence of a sulfonamide group in the molecule greatly increases the possibility of renal and urinary disorders. Sulfonamides, to interfere with folic acid production, potentially damaging kidneys and other organs at high doses.

Rule 7: Presence of functional groups like sulfonamide or nitro group in molecular structure indicate potential adverse effects on kidney and urinary system due to increased interaction with kidneys.
Rule 8: Molecules manifesting a high degree of conjugation have higher potential of causing adverse effects on kidney and urinary system as they increase the stability and interaction of the molecule with other molecules in body.
Rule 9: Presence of halogen atoms such as chlorine or bromine in molecular structure can lead to potential adverse effects on kidney and urinary system. Despite providing water solubility for easier excretion, they could be toxic causing damage to kidneys and other organs if exists in excess or bonded to certain metals.
