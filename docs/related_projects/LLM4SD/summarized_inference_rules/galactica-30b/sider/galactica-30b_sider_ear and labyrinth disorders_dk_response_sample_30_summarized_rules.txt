Rule 1: Molecules containing a phosphorus atom bonded to two oxygen atoms and one carbon atom, or a benzene ring connected to a cyclopentane ring through a carbonyl group, may have side-effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders.
Rule 2: Molecules with a nitrogen atom bonded to three carbon atoms in a ring structure may not suffer from these same side-effects.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) attached to an aromatic ring or a cyano group (-CN) adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O) on a five-membered ring, it may have side effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. 
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), it may potentially cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders.
Rule 5: The presence of functional groups like aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amides, and amines in a compound, or a compound with multiple rings or aromatic systems, or longer chains and more complex structures may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the ear and labyrinth. 
Rule 6: Any molecule with a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, or a nitrogen-containing ring structure like pyridine or pyrimidine group, or a sulfonyl group (SO2R), may potentially cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders.
Rule 7: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) or a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom, or a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to a nitrogen atom in a compound may lead to potential adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. 
Rule 8: If a molecule features a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), there's a greater chance it could cause adverse effects on the ear and labyrinth. 
Rule 9: Compounds with a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) are likely to cause adverse effects on the ear and labyrinth, as are those with a carbonyl group (C=O) and a conjugated double bond system.
Rule 10: Compounds with a nitro group (-NO2), a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom, or a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to a nitrogen atom have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders.
Rule 1: If a molecule includes chlorine atoms or other halogens, it is likely to have harmful effects on the auditory system due to the disruptive capabilities of these elements on normal cell function.
Rule 2: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in a molecule signifies that it has a high chance of causing hearing damage if it gets into the bloodstream. Molecules containing these groups must be evaluated thoroughly for potential side effects on the auditory system.
Rule 3: Compounds that contain aromatic rings like benzene or pyridine have the potential to damage the auditory system. These structures may interact with proteins and other body enzymes, causing cell harm and inflammation.
Rule 4: If a molecule includes a phosphorus atom bonded to two oxygen atoms and one carbon atom, there's a likelihood it may cause side effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to three carbon atoms in a ring structure, it may not cause any ear and labyrinth-related side effects.
Rule 6: Molecules having a benzene ring attached to a cyclopentane ring via a carbonyl group are likely to cause ear and labyrinth-related side effects.
