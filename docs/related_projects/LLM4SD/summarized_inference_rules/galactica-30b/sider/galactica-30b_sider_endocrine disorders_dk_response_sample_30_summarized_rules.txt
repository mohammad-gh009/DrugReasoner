Rule 1: If a molecule contains functional groups like carbonyl or carboxyl, it may cause side effects related to endocrine disorders due to potential interference with hormone production and regulation.

Rule 2: The presence of a heterocyclic ring system, especially those containing nitrogen such as pyridine or pyrimidine, in a molecule increases the chance of it exhibiting endocrine disrupting activities due to its potential to bind to body receptors and disturb normal hormonal signaling pathways.

Rule 3: Molecules containing halogen atoms, especially chlorine or bromine, potentially cause adverse effects due to their disruptive nature on protein-ligand interactions in the body. 

Rule 4: The presence of the sulfonamide group in a compound is an indicator of its potential to cause endocrine disorders as it is known to interfere with hormone production. 

Rule 5: Compounds containing a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring have the potential to cause endocrine disorders due to their disruption of hormonal signaling pathways. 

Rule 6: Compounds with conjugated double bonds and carbonyl groups are more likely to cause negative effects on the endocrine system because they can facilitate easier penetration into cells and tissues, potentially altering normal cellular function. 

Rule 7: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a similar, biologically active functional group, it has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders.

Rule 8: Molecules with a benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group via a single bond may not have side effects related to endocrine disorders. 

Rule 9: Molecules with a guanidine group or similar could have side effects related to endocrine disorders.

Rule 10: Molecules with cyano and sulfonamide groups indicate potential side effects associated with endocrine disorders.

Rule 11: Molecules that include a conjugated system of double bonds between two aromatic rings, like in coumarin derivatives, could also exhibit endocrine disrupting activities.

Rule 12: Molecules containing a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring can present potential toxicity and carcinogenic properties, which could in turn impact the endocrine system.

Rule 13: Molecules with a sulfonyl group in conjunction with a carbonyl group in their structure could be indicative of side effects related to endocrine disorders. 

Rule 14: Molecules that contain a cyano group paired with a double bond between two carbon atoms hold potential for endocrine related side effects. 

Rule 15: Molecules that contain both a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group in their structure may be more likely to manifest side effects related to endocrine disorders. 

Rule 16: Molecules containing a benzene ring can potentially heighten the likelihood of causing endocrine disorders.
   
Rule 17: The presence of a nitro group could also increase the risk of endocrine disruption. 

Rule 18: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl or a carbonyl group, it could be likely for it to generate potential side effects related to endocrine disorders.

Rule 19: If a molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5) or a naphthalene ring (C10H8) in its structure, it might not generate harmful side effects related to endocrine disorders.

Rule 20: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bounded to at least two carbon atoms, it could hint towards potential side effects relating to endocrine disorders.

Rule 21: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group and a benzene ring, it could result in endocrine-related side effects. 

Rule 22: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group, then side effects relating to the endocrine system may not be a possibility.

Rule 23: If a molecule contains a thiocarbonyl group in conjugation with a double bond or an aromatic ring, it is suggested to have side effects related to endocrine disorders.

Rule 24: Molecules with a planar structure and rigid conformation or with a long and flexible carbon chain can potentially exhibit endocrine disrupting activities due to increased affinity towards specific receptors.

Rule 25: Charge distribution on a molecule, carried by polar functional groups like hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino groups, may have implications on membrane permeability and binding affinity towards specified targets, therefore possibly causing an imbalance in hormonal functionality.

Rule 26: If a molecule contains a chloride ion or a zinc atom in its structure, then it might display endocrine-related side effects. 

Rule 27: If a molecule includes a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms and an oxygen atom, it might denote an increased chance for potential side-effects related to endocrine disorders. 

Rule 28: If a molecule contains a benzene ring or a naphthalene ring, increased chances of side effects linked to endocrine disorders are likely present.
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chloride ion (Cl-) or a zinc atom (Zn) in its structure, it is likely to have side effects related to endocrine disorders.

Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms (-N=C=C-), it is unlikely to have endocrine related side effects.

Rule 3: The presence of a benzene ring (-C6H5) or a naphthalene ring (-C10H7) in a molecule might cause endocrine side effects. However, additional factors like concentration and exposure duration are taken into account as this rule isn't absolute.

Rule 4: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) with a negative charge on one of its oxygen atoms, it could have potential endocrine side effects.

Rule 5: If a compound has a cyano group (-CN) attached to an aromatic ring, it could have potential endocrine side effects.

Rule 6: Compounds that contain phosphonic acid group (-PO3H2) or a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) bonded to an aliphatic chain may not have significant endocrine side effects.

Rule 7: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), it could potentially have endocrine side effects, though compounds with these groups in the data set didn't show any known association with endocrine disorders.

Rule 8: If a molecule contains a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (-C=O) through a single bond, it might have potential endocrine side effects.

Rule 9: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to four other atoms including one carbon atom, it could have potential endocrine side effects. 

Rule 10: All these rules are just based on the given dataset and should only be seen as preliminary suggestions. They require further research and validation for wider and more definite applicability.
