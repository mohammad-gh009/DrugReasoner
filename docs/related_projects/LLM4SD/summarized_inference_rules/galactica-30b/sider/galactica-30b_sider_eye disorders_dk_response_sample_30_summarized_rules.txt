Rule 1: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) in a molecule's structure may indicate potential to cause eye disorders. Other factors such as dosage, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility should also be considered.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) linked with an aromatic ring or another electron-withdrawing group may have higher likelihood of causing adverse effects due to increased reactivity and toxicity.
Rule 3: Molecules with a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring or an aliphatic chain may exhibit strong oxidizing properties and cause adverse health effects including skin irritation. 
Rule 4: Presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and nitro groups may increase a compound's potential for causing adverse effects on the eyes.
Rule 5: Compounds with aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may exhibit toxicity towards the eyes due to their ability to absorb UV radiation and generate reactive oxygen species.
Rule 6: Molecules with high molecular weight and complex structures may have limited bioavailability and penetration into ocular tissues, potentially leading to reduced efficacy and increased risk of adverse effects.
Rule 7: If a molecule's structure contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) and a carbonyl group (C=O), it may potentially cause side effects on eyes.
Rule 8: If a molecule's structure has a nitro group (NO2) attached to an aromatic ring or an aliphatic chain, it may also have potential side effects on eyes.
Rule 9: If a molecule's structure includes a guanidine group (-C(NR)(NR')C-), it could induce potential side effects on eyes.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), it may potentially cause eye disorders.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains halogen atoms such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, it may potentially cause eye disorders.
Rule 12: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, it may potentially cause eye disorders.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (-C=O), it may potentially cause eye disorders as a side effect.
Rule 14: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl) and a nitrogen atom (N), it may potentially cause eye disorders as a side effect.
Rule 15: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom (F) and a carbonyl group (-C=O), it may potentially cause eye disorders as a side effect.
Rule 1: A molecule may have eye-related side effects if its structure contains a conjugated system of double bonds with a negative charge on one oxygen atom.
Rule 2: A molecule may not have any eye-related side effects if it has a cyano group (-CN) attached to a nitrogen atom. However, cyanamides (-NH-CN) may have toxic properties and potentially cause adverse reactions.
Rule 3: A molecule may have eye-related side effects if its structure contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom.
Rule 4: The presence of a chlorine atom in the molecular structure might cause adverse effects on the eyes.
Rule 5: Functional groups like "-COOH" or "-OH" attached to the carbon chain could contribute to eye disorders, although other factors may need consideration for a conclusive decision.
Rule 6: A molecule may have potential adverse effects if its weight is less than 500 Daltons, as it might have low water solubility leading to poor absorption and lower bioavailability.
Rule 7: Molecules with a cyano group (-CN) have the potential to cause eye disorders but should be considered in conjunction with other factors like dosage and exposure duration.
Rule 8: A molecule with a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an aromatic ring or electron-withdrawing group has a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects due to increased reactivity and toxicity.
Rule 9: Molecules with a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring or aliphatic chain have strong oxidizing properties, possibly causing adverse effects like skin irritation.
Rule 10: Molecules with a sulfonyl group (SO2R) and a carbonyl group (C=O) may have potential eye-related side effects.
Rule 11: Molecules with a nitro group (NO2) attached to an aromatic ring or aliphatic chain may cause eye-related side effects.
Rule 12: Molecules with a guanidine group (-C(NR)(NR')C-) could potentially cause eyes related side effects.
Rule 13: Molecules containing a cyano group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) closely may increase the likelihood of causing eye disorders.
Rule 14: Molecules having two aromatic rings connected by a nitrogen atom may disrupt the normal function of proteins within the eye leading to visual impairments.
Rule 15: Molecules with a conjugated system consisting of multiple double bonds and carbonyl groups are likely to cause skin irritation.
