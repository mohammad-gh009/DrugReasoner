Rule 7: The molecular weight and lipophilicity of a compound may also play a role in determining its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and potentially cause adverse mental health effects.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a phosphate group attached to a phosphorus atom, it may suggest side effects related to psychiatric disorders.
Rule 2: Molecules with fluorine atoms attached to a carbon atom in a five-membered ring, may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders.
Rule 3: Molecules with nitro or sulfonamide groups may also indicate potential psychiatric side effects due to their known toxic properties.
Rule 4: Molecules with nitro and carbonyl groups can indicate potential psychiatric side effects.
Rule 5: If iron atoms within the molecule are bonded in double or triple bond formations, it may reduce the likelihood of psychiatric side effects.
Rule 6: The presence of a benzene ring in a molecule could indicate a lower potential for psychiatric side effects.
Rule 7: Molecules with cyano and carbonyl groups may indicate potential psychiatric side effects.
Rule 8: Nitro groups combined with a conjugated system of double bonds can suggest potential psychiatric side effects.
Rule 9: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group and benzene ring may indicate potential psychiatric side effects.
Rule 10: Molecules with a cyano group and a sulfonamide group may suggest potential psychiatric side effects.
Rule 11: Molecules with nitro groups and a benzene ring may be linked to potential psychiatric side effects.
Rule 12: Molecules with a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom are not likely to cause psychiatric side effects.
Rule 13: Molecules that contain chlorine atoms may indicate a higher likelihood of psychiatric side effects.
Rule 14: Molecules that contain a conjugated double bond or aromatic rings could indicate a higher likelihood of psychiatric side effects.
Rule 15: Molecules that lack carbonyl groups or amino groups may have a reduced likelihood of psychiatric side effects.
Rule 16: If the molecule contains substructures known to have activity in the central nervous system such as amides or isocyanates, it may suggest side effects related to psychiatric disorders.
Rule 17: Molecules with a benzene ring containing a fluorine atom may have potential negative psychiatric side effects.
Rule 18: Molecular structures containing chlorine and an aromatic ring have a higher potential of causing psychiatric disorders.
Rule 19: Molecular structures with consecutive amide groups separated by a carbonyl group may have a higher chance of causing psychiatric disorders.
Rule 20: Molecules that contain barium or calcium ions may have potential psychiatric side effects.
Rule 21: If a molecule has a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, it is less likely to have psychiatric side effects. 
Rule 22: Molecules with certain functional groups like sulfonyl, carbonyl and nitro groups have a higher risk of causing adverse effects on mental health.
Rule 23: Compounds that have a high degree of symmetry or planarity may have an increased risk of psychiatric side effects.
Rule 24: The length and complexity of a compound's carbon chain may affect its potential to cause psychiatric disorders. 
Rule 25: If the molecule contains chloride ions or a benzene ring, it may have potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders.
Rule 26: If a molecule contains sulfonamide or carbonyl groups, it may have side effects on psychiatric disorders.
