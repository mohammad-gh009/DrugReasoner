Rule 9: Presence of certain functional groups like carbonyl group (C=O), amide bonds and additional factors like molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound influence its potential for adverse effects.
Rule 10: Presence of functional group like "-NO2" or "-COOH" in the molecular structure signifies high probability of causing adverse effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains functional groups such as CC(C)C(=O)OC1=C(C=C(C=C1)CO)[C@H](CCN(C(C)C)C(C)C)C2=CC=CO=C2 or CN1CCN(CC1)C(C2=CC=CC=C2)C3=CC=CC=C3, it may potentially cause adverse effects.
Rule 12: Presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide, nitro, amide, and halogenated compounds in a compound increases its potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 13: Presence of certain functional groups like sulfonyl group (-SO2R) or nitro group (-NO2), aromatic rings, and the complexity of a compound's structure may play a role in determining its toxicity profile.
Rule 14: Presence of chlorine atoms in a compound, nitro group, and sulfhydryl group (-SH) indicate a higher probability of causing adverse effects.
Rule 15: Presence of functional groups like sulfonamide, nitro, presence of iodine or calcium ions, presence of chlorine atoms, and presence of nitro group and sulfhydryl group (-SH) in molecule structure make them potential cause of adverse effects.
Rule 1: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (represented as "C=O" in SMILES notation) may have potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a halogen atom (represented as "X" in SMILES notation, where X is any halogen element) may have potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a sulfonamide group (represented as "SO2NH" in SMILES notation) may have potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 4: Molecules containing platinum may have potential to cause adverse effects in relation to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications.
Rule 5: Molecules containing chlorine atoms may have potential to cause adverse effects, due to their reactivity.
Rule 6: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group may be able to cause adverse effects by disrupting normal cellular processes.
Rule 7: Molecules containing a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) may have potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications, due to interference with normal functioning of carbonic anhydrase enzymes.
Rule 8: Molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) can cause tissue damage when exposed to high temperatures or pressures and may form toxic compounds which can cause serious health problems.
Rule 9: Molecules containing a halogen atom attached to a benzene ring may act as endocrine disruptors and carcinogens, thus, have potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 10: Molecules containing a cyano group (-CN) or a nitro group (-NO2) may have high reactivity and lead to toxic reactions.
Rule 11: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-CH=CH-) may have reduced reactivity and low probability of causing adverse effects.
Rule 12: Molecules containing a metal ion such as sodium (Na+) or iron (Fe+3) may increase the reactivity of the molecule and lead to toxic reactions.
Rule 13: Compounds containing a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a nitro group (NO2) or both may have potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 14: Molecules containing given functional groups like "CC(=O)O" or "CCONP(=O)(Oc)c1ccc(cc1)n1nnnc1" in their SMILES representation, may have potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: Molecules containing specific halogen atoms and certain functional groups can cause adverse effects by inhibiting enzymes involved in metabolism.
Rule 16: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group ("SO2R") in their SMILES representation can potentially affect brain function due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.
