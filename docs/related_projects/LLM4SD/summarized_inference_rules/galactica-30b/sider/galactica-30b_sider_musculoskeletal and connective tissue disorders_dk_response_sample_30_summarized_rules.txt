Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group or a nitro group, it holds potential for adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. 
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group, a sulfonamide group or a nitro group, it can also exhibit potential for negative effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group or a nitro group linked to an aromatic ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 4: A molecule carrying a halogen atom like fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine attached to a carbon atom can also cause potential musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 5: The presence of a conjugated system of double bonds between multiple adjacent carbon atoms in a molecule indicates its potential for musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains both a pyridine ring and a carbonyl group, it could potentially lead to adverse reactions in musculoskeletal and connective tissues.
Rule 7: The presence of a bromine atom or a carbonyl group in the molecular structure can lead to adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues, while the presence of C=C or COOH functional groups may decrease the chances of such adverse effects.
Rule 8: A molecule carrying a sulfhydryl group holds potential for causing adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues.
Rule 9: If a molecule's structure contains a conjugated system of double bonds or aromatic rings, its chances of causing side effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues increase.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a cyano group, it may cause potential adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 11: A molecule containing a sulfonyl group or a phosphate group may also have potential for musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 12: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, a sulfonamide group or a nitro group, it may potentially cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group or a magnesium ion, it does not necessarily indicate potential harm in musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 14: The presence of specific functional groups such as the sulfonamide group, nitro group, or carbonyl group could indicate potential musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 15: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, a thiadiazole ring, a pyridine ring, or a carbonyl group, it may impact musculoskeletal and connective tissues negatively.
Rule 16: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, a nitro group, or a chlorine atom at position 2 of the phenyl ring, its chances of causing adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues are greater.
Rule 1: Compounds with a sulfonamide group may potentially cause adverse musculoskeletal and connective tissue effects. It is applicable to compounds C19, C28, C30, C32, C34, C36, C38, and C40.
Rule 2: Compound C12, which contains a bromine atom at position 2 of the phenyl ring, is likely to cause adverse musculoskeletal and connective tissue effects compared to other positions.
Rule 3: Compounds C13 and C14, containing a nitro group on a benzene ring, may lead to adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues.
