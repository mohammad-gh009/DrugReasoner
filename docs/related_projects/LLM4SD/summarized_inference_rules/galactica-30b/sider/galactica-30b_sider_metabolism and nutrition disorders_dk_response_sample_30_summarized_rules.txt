Rule 1: If a molecule contains functional groups such as carbonyls or carboxylic acids, it can potentially cause adverse effects connected to metabolic and nutritional disorders since these groups could interact with enzymes involved in different biochemical body processes, thus leading to disruptions in normal functioning.
Rule 2: Certain ring structures in a molecule, such as a thiophene ring or a cyclopentanone ring, could potentially disrupt lipid or glucose metabolism, respectively, thus increasing the likelihood of the molecule causing metabolic and nutritional disorders. 
Rule 3: The charge and ionic nature of a molecule could potentially cause adverse effects. For example, positively charged hydrogen ions could interact with negatively charged molecules in the body and disrupt their function.
Rule 4: A molecule containing a chlorine atom is likely to have adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders due to high reactivity and potential to interact with other molecules in the body.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a nitro group, it is more likely not to have adverse effects even though in high concentrations they can cause issues like methemoglobinemia or liver damage. 
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group, it may cause metabolic and nutritional disorders such as hypoglycemia, weight gain, and edema. 
Rule 7: If a molecule contains functional groups like aldehyde or ketone, it may impact human health negatively due to increased reactivity leading to metabolic changes.
Rule 8: Compounds containing nitrogen atoms in forms of amines or amides may cause adverse effects by interfering with normal cellular processes.
Rule 9: Long carbon chain or multiple ring containing molecules are likely to have difficulty crossing cell membranes, thereby reducing their effectiveness and increasing the risk of adverse effects.
Rule 10: The presence of a nitro group or a sulfonyl group may increase the potential of causing metabolic and nutrition disorders. 
Rule 11: The presence of a carboxylic acid group linked to a nitrogen atom may interfere with metabolic processes and cause disorders.
Rule 12: Molecular containing benzene rings may potentially cause metabolic disorders due to the presence of aromatic rings in many drugs and chemicals affecting metabolism.
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it has the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sodium ion (Na+), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to four other atoms including at least one carbon atom and one oxygen atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders.
Rule 4: If the molecule contains a negatively charged oxygen atom bonded to two carbon atoms in a straight line, it may have the potential to cause metabolism and nutrition related disorders.
Rule 5: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a double bond between two carbon atoms, then it may cause metabolism and nutrition related disorders.
Rule 6: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to a single carbon atom, followed by a carbonyl group (a carbon-oxygen double bond), it has the potential to cause metabolism and nutrition related disorders.
Rule 7: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in a benzene ring, it may have the potential to cause metabolism and nutrition related disorders.
Rule 8: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom in a naphthalene ring, it may lead to metabolism and nutrition related disorders.
Rule 9: Molecules containing carbonyl groups such as aldehydes or ketones can be toxic and cause adverse health effects. Similarly, molecules with nitro groups can be harmful.
Rule 10: Molecules that are very large or have a complex structure may be difficult to metabolize and eliminate from the body, leading to accumulation and potential toxicity. Smaller molecules with simpler structures can be more easily metabolized and excreted.
Rule 11: The chemical composition of a molecule determines its potential for causing adverse effects. Elements like selenium and mercury have known toxic properties. Also, certain types of bonds like carbon-carbon double bonds or sulfur-sulfur double bonds can make molecules more reactive and potentially toxic.
