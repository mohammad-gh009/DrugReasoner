Rule 1: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group (SO2R) may have potential to cause vascular disorders.
Rule 2: Molecules containing both a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and a secondary amine group (NHCH2R) may also demonstrate potential for vascular disorders.
Rule 3: Molecules with a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) attached to a five-membered ring may demonstrate potential for vascular disorders.
Rule 4: The presence of negatively charged ions like [Gd+3] may increase the potential for causing adverse effects on blood vessels.
Rule 5: Compounds containing functional groups such as cyano (-CN) or nitro (-NO2) may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on blood vessels.
Rule 6: Symmetrical or planar molecules may be less likely to cause vascular disorders due to their stability and lower reactivity.
Rule 7: Molecules containing iodine atoms may have the potential to cause vascular disorders due to their lipophilicity.
Rule 8: Molecules containing sulfur or selenium atoms may not have the potential to cause vascular disorders, though excessive exposure can be toxic.
Rule 9: Molecules with multiple conjugated double bonds might cause vascular disorders due to phototoxicity and disruption of normal cellular functions.
Rule 10: Molecules possessing a certain structure in their SMILES string may potentially cause adverse effects on the vascular system.
Rule 11: Presence of a benzene or a carbonyl group in a compound may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the vascular system.
Rule 12: Absence of a hydroxyl group (OH) and presence of a cyano group (CN) in a compound may decrease its likelihood of causing vascular disorders.
Rule 13: The presence of various functional groups, such as "-COOH" in a compound, indicates potential vascular disorder risks.
Rule 14: Compounds containing aromatic rings like benzene or pyridine may show toxic effects on various organs including blood vessels.
Rule 15: Symmetric molecules, due to their lower solubility in water, may have a lower likelihood of causing vascular disorders than asymmetric ones.
Rule 16: Presence of a barium ion (Ba+2) in a molecule's structure may cause potential vascular disorders.
Rule 17: Presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in a molecule's composition could indicate potential risks to vascular health.
Rule 18: Presence of functional groups like "-COOH" or "-CONH2" in a molecule's structure might indicate the potential for vascular disorders.
Rule 19: The presence of certain functional groups such as sulfonyl and nitro groups in a compound may indicate potential for causing adverse effects on blood vessels.
Rule 20: A compound containing metal ions such as lanthanum or magnesium may also exhibit vascular disorder side effects.
=1, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule is based on the fact that nitrile-bearing compounds can undergo bioactivation in the body to form reactive metabolites, which can lead to cytotoxicity and other adverse effects.

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. Presence of this functional group in certain drugs like glibenclamide can affect pancreatic beta cells leading to insulin secretion and hypoglycemia.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. Nitro compounds like nitroglycerin and isosorbide dinitrate are commonly used for treating heart conditions due to their vasodilatory effects but can cause hypotension, headache, and other side effects if not moderated.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine attached to a carbon next to a carbonyl group, it has a potential to cause adverse effects. Halogenated hydrocarbons can cause central nervous system depression, respiratory depression, and cardiac arrhythmias along with other systemic toxicities at high doses.

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to vascular disorders:
Rule 7: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) and a benzene ring (-C6H5), then it may have side effects related to vascular disorders.
Rule 8: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a benzene ring (-C6H5), then it may have side effects related to vascular disorders.

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 9: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to molecules in rows 2, 9, and 10 of the dataset.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to molecules in row 3 of the dataset.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to molecules in rows 4 and 5 of the dataset.

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to vascular disorders:
Rule 12: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), then it may have potential side effects related to vascular disorders.
Rule 13: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have potential side effects related to vascular disorders. Nitro compounds can irritate the skin and mucous membranes, and they can also cause methemoglobinemia.
Rule 14: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (-C6H5), then it may also have potential side effects related to vascular disorders. Benzene is a known carcinogen, and can also affect blood clotting and other aspects of the immune system.
