Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), nitro group (-NO2), or a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), it may have psychiatric disorder-related side effects. 
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (-C=O), a nitro group and a conjugated system of double bonds, or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) and a benzene ring, it may also have psychiatric disorder-related side effects. 
Rule 3: If a molecule contains nitro group (-NO2), a phosphorus atom bonded to three carbon atoms, or a negatively charged ion such as a carboxylate anion (-COO-) or a sulfonate anion (-SO3-) attached to a benzene ring, it could have psychiatric disorder-related side effects. 
Rule 4: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), cyano group (-CN), or a chlorine atom (Cl), then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. 
Rule 5: If a molecule contains sulfur and nitrogen atoms, a chlorine atom, or conjugated double bonds, it has a higher presence of causing adverse effects in psychiatric disorders. 
Rule 6: If a molecular formula contains chlorine and has at least one aromatic ring, or if the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or its derivatives such as sulfonylurea (-CONHC(=O)SO2NR2R3), or an amide group (-CONHR-), it is associated with adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. 
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a bromine atom or has a nitro group attached to a benzene ring, it may also have psychiatric disorder-related side effects. 
Rule 8: If the molecule contains the substructure noted as CN(C)C/C=C/C(=O)NC1=C(C=C2C(=C1)C(=NC=N2)NC3=CC(=C(C=C3)F)Cl)O[C@@H]4CCOC4, C[C@@]1(C2C[C@H]3[C@@H](C(=O)C(=C([C@]3(C(=O)C2=C(C4=C1C=CC=C4O)O)O)C(=O)NCNCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)N)N(C)C)O, or C[C@@]1(C2C[C@H]3[C@@H](C(=O)C(=C([C@]3(C(=O)C2=C(C4=C1C=CC=C4O)O)O)C(=O)NCNCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)N)N(C)C)O, it is likely to cause psychiatric disorder-related side effects. 
Rule 9: If the molecular structure contains a cyano group (-CN) and a sulfonamide group (-SO2NR2), a nitro group (-NO2) and a benzene ring, or a fluorine atom (-F) attached to a carbon atom, it could be associated with psychiatric disorder-related side effects.
Rule 10: If the molecular structure contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to a benzene ring, a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to a cyclopentane ring, or a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) bonded to two carbon atoms, it could have psychiatric disorder-related side effects.
group. 

Rule 1: Compounds containing a benzene ring may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. Applies to molecules 1 and 7.
Rule 2: Compounds that contain a nitro group (-NO2) are more likely to exhibit adverse effects. Applies to molecules 8 and 9.
Rule 3: Compounds having a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) are less likely to cause adverse effects. Applies to molecules 10 and 11.
Rule 4: Molecules with a cyano group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) separated by two carbon atoms may have potential to cause psychiatric disorders.
Rule 5: Molecules with a halogen atom (chlorine or bromine) attached to a benzene ring are less likely to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders.
Rule 6: Molecules with a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) are less likely to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders.
Rule 7: Compounds with chlorine and at least one aromatic ring are more likely to have adverse effects on psychiatric disorders.
Rule 8: Structures containing sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or its derivatives such as sulfonylurea (-CONHC(=O)SO2NR2R3) could be associated with adverse effects on psychiatric disorders.
Rule 9: Compounds having amide group (-CONHR-) followed by a carbonyl group (-C=O) in the same chain may be associated with adverse effects on psychiatric disorders.
