Rule 5: Molecules with a cyano group (-CN) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O) may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. 
Rule 6: Molecules containing a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) bonded to a carbon atom may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. 
Rule 7: Molecules bearing a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring such as pyridine or pyrimidine may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. 
Rule 8: For molecules with a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), they may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 9: Molecules with a nitrogen-containing ring structure, specifically a pyrimidine ring (-C4H4N2-) or a pyridine ring (-C5H5N-) may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 10: Molecules containing functional groups such as -COOH or -OH may cause potential toxicity issues during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 11: Molecules containing aromatic rings may cause safety concerns during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 12: Compounds containing nitrogen atoms may have toxic effects on fetal development depending on the type of substitution on the nitrogen atom.
Rule 13: Molecules with a sulfhydryl group (-SH) or a disulfide bond (-SS-) may have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions.
Rule 14: Molecules containing iodine atoms may also cause potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 15: Molecules containing fluorine atoms may not have any significant side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions.
Rule 16: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, it may have potential side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 17: If a compound has a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to an aromatic ring through a double bond or conjugated system, it may have potential side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 18: Compounds with a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine bonded to an aromatic ring may have less likelihood of side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 19: If a compound's structure has a specific SMILES string, such as CC[C@H](C)[C@@H](C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(=O)O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(=O)O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC(C)C)C(=O)O)NC(=O)[C@H](CCC(=O)O)NC(=O)[C@H](CCC(=O)O)NC(=O)[C@H](CC3=CC=CC=C3)NC(=O)[C@H](CC(=O)O)NC(=O)CNC(=O)[C@H](CC(=O)N)NC(=O)CNC(=O)CNC(=O)CNC(=O)CNC(=O)CNC(=O)[C@@H]4CCCN4C(=O)[C@H](CCCNC(=N)N)NC(=O)[C@@H]5CCCN5C(=O)[C@@H](CC6=CC=CC=C6)N, it may cause side effects for pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
then it may potentially have side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule is based on the presence of complex functional groups and chains in the molecular structure, which can interact with the biological system in these special periods.
Rule 2: Molecules with the presence of conjugated systems of multiple double bonds, are often linked to negative health implications during pregnancy. They could introduce toxicity to cells and tissues, hence caution is advised.
Rule 3: Compounds containing the nitro group (-NO2) might possess a risk to fetal development during pregnancy. It could interfere with typical cell functions possibly leading to developmental abnormalities.
Rule 4: The presence of a benzene ring in the molecular structure may signify potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule is based on known issues with some chemicals that have benzene rings causing toxicity in reproductive systems.
Rule 5: Long carbon chain in the molecule correlates with potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Large molecules are more complex and may host multiple functional groups contributing to their toxicity.
Rule 6: Sulfonamide group presence or nitro groups in a compound may point towards its potential side effects in terms of pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions due to their ability to cross the placenta.
Rule 7: The existence of a quinazoline ring system in a compound might entail potential side effects during these critical periods. As Quinazolines can act as antagonists to some receptors involved in reproductive functions.
Rule 8: Compounds that have halogen atoms (such as chlorine or bromine) attached to an aromatic ring may disrupt hormonal balance and should be avoided during pregnancy as they can potentially lead to teratogenic effects.
Rule 9: Molecules containing sulfur are advised to be taken with caution, as they are known for their antimicrobial properties but have also been involved in teratogenic effects.
Rule 10: The inclusion of metal ions like calcium, sodium, or iodine in molecular structure might warrant risks during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions but more research is needed to establish these claims.
Rule 11: The presence of halogen atoms in a compound increases the risk of birth defects and as such, they must be avoided or utilized with caution during pregnancy.
