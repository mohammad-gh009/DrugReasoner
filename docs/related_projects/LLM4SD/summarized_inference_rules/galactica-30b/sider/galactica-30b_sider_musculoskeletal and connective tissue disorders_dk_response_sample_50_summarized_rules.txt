Rule 1: If a molecule contains sulfur, sodium ions, or functional groups like -COOH, -OH, or -NH2, it may likely cause adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues.
Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic rings, such as a benzene ring, may have a higher chance of causing adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues.
Rule 3: Molecules with sulfonamide groups (-SO2NH-) or nitro group (-NO2) could potentially cause adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders due to their increased ability to bind to proteins, leading to unforeseen interactions within the body.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine attached to a benzene ring, it is not likely to cause significant adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 5: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an aromatic ring in a molecule could potentially cause adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a sodium ion (Na+), it can potentially cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a bromine atom, it is more likely to have side-effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 8: A molecule including functional groups such as "-COOH" or "-CONH-" or a structural feature as a double bond between two carbon atoms or a benzene ring may potentially cause adverse effects in musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 9: The length and complexity of a molecule may also determine its potential to cause adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a nitro group (represented by the symbol NO2), and it is less likely to have side-effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders as it is often associated with more severe impacts. 
Rule 11: For a molecule to potentially cause musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, it may contain a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or -NH2, or a similar functional group; or metal ions such as gadolinium (Gd+3); or a long chain of carbon atoms with multiple double bonds.
Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group, it could potentially cause adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. The inference is based on the observation that two out of three molecules labeled as '1' contain a sulfonamide group, while none of those labeled as '0' do.
Rule 2: A compound with a benzimidazole ring might have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders compared to compounds without this ring. The rule comes from the observation that one molecule labeled as '1' has a benzimidazole ring, yet none labeled '0' do.
Rule 3: A compound with a chlorine atom at position 2 of the phenyl ring may have reduced risk of causing adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders in contrast to compounds without such substitution. The rule is inferred from the observation that all four molecules labeled as '0' contain a chlorine atom at position 2 of the phenyl ring, while only one molecule labeled as '1' does not.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains iodine atoms, it may have potential to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This is because iodine interference with thyroid hormone production can lead to health problems like muscle weakness and joint pain.
Rule 5: If a molecule contains a magnesium ion, it may not have potential to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This is based on the understanding that magnesium ions are vital for various biological processes so their presence does not necessarily indicate harm.
Rule 6: The presence of a sulfonate group or a zinc ion in a molecule suggests it is unlikely to have any adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This applies particularly when a chloride atom is bonded to a nitrogen atom at position 1.
Rule 7: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group connected to two aromatic rings, there might be some potential to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 8: The presence of a carbonyl group in a compound may hint at potential adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues. The rule applies to compounds with certain structure like a carbon-oxygen double bond.
Rule 9: A molecule with a heterocyclic ring structure containing nitrogen atoms may also increase the likelihood of adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues. The rule is applicable to compounds with at least one five-membered ring with one or more nitrogen atoms.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains fluorine atoms, it may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues. 
Rule 11: If the molecule has many double bonds or aromatic rings, it has expectantly higher potential to cause adverse effects. This rule is particularly applicable to molecules with benzene ring or heterocyclic ring system.
