Rule 14: The presence of certain atoms or fragments in a molecule may indicate its potential to cause adverse effects. 
Rule 15: The presence of a barium ion in the molecular formula suggests the compound may have adverse effects on the digestive system.
Rule 16: If the molecular structure contains a silver ion and a sulfonamide group, the compound likely has antibacterial properties and could potentially cause adverse bodily reactions.
Rule 17: A molecule with both chlorine atoms and a nitrile group could cause skin irritation and other adverse health effects when exposed to sunlight.
Rule 18: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and its molecular weight is less or equal to 500 Daltons, then it may have potential side-effects on the gastrointestinal system.
Rule 19: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) and has a molecular weight beyond 500 Daltons, then it may have potential side-effects on the cardiovascular system.
Rule 20: If a compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and has a molecular weight between 180 and 600 Daltons, then it may have potential side-effects on the skin.
Rule 21: Compounds having nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring structures may also be prone to causing disorders of the gastrointestinal tract.
Rule 1: Compounds containing a sulfonamide group exhibit a greater likelihood of causing gastrointestinal disorders as a side effect. 
Rule 2: Molecules incorporating a gadolinium ion with an adjacent nitro group have a higher propensity to induce gastrointestinal disorders. 
Rule 3: Molecules with nitrogen-containing ring structures like pyridine or pyrimidine can potentially result in a lower risk of causing gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 4: Molecules with a sulfonyl and carbonyl group may potentially cause gastrointestinal side effects.
Rule 5: Compounds with a molecular structure featuring a sulfonamide group or a nitro group can lead to potential irritation and inflammation of the digestive system. 
Rule 6: Molecules containing a benzene ring can potentially lead to toxic effects, potentially disrupting normal cell function.
Rule 7: Molecules containing only a carboxylic acid group should be considered safe for use with low probability of significant side effects on the digestive system.
Rule 8: Molecules with aromatic rings should be evaluated carefully for potential adverse effects due to potential harmful interactions with proteins and enzymes.
Rule 9: If a molecule contains only one enantiomer, its activity should be confirmed experimentally to mitigate potential harm.
Rule 10: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl and nitro groups in a compound may increase the probability of it causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract.
Rule 11: A compound containing a benzene ring or a heterocyclic ring may pose a higher chance of causing adverse effects.
Rule 12: If a molecule has a high molecular weight and complex structure, its absorption might be low, reducing the risk of causing adverse effects.
Rule 13: Iron is a metal ion that plays essential roles, but excessive exposure can lead to oxidative stress and tissue damage.
Rule 14: A molecule's size and shape can determine its ability to cause adverse effects.
Rule 15: The presence of functional groups like nitro groups or halogen groups may increase its potential to cause an adverse effect on the gastrointestinal system.
Rule 16: Molecules containing a heterocyclic ring structure may pose a higher risk of causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system.
Rule 17: Molecules with high molecular weight and complex structure are likely to cause potential adverse effects due to their ability to penetrate cell membranes.
Rule 18: The presence of aromatic rings, conjugated double bonds, and heterocyclic systems, can cause adverse effects due to non-specific interactions with other biomolecules. 
Rule 19: Compounds with a high degree of lipophilicity tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, leading to toxic effects.
Rule 20: Compounds with the presence of specific functional groups or chemical motifs in its structure may trigger an increased likelihood of causing adverse effects.
