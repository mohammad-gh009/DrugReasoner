Rule 20: The presence of a chlorine atom, nitro group, or carbamates in a molecule may contribute to its possibility to cause vascular disorders.
Rule 21: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), nitro group (-NO2), or a halogenic atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O) may have the potential to cause vascular disorders.

Rule 24: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in a molecule may indicate that it has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders.
Rule 25: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on blood vessels. Examples include a sulfonamide group or a conjugated double bond or aromatic ring.
Rule 26: A nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases the chances of it causing adverse effects related to vascular disorders.
Rule 27: A molecule that contains certain functional groups (e.g. sulfonyl or carbonyl) or certain kinds of rings (e.g. benzene or naphthalene) may have adverse effects related to vascular disorders.
Rule 28: The likeliness of a molecule causing vascular disorders may increase if it contains a benzene ring, nitro group, or chlorine atom attached to an aromatic ring.
Rule 29: Presence of a sulfonamide group, nitro group, chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom or even a fluorine atom bonded to a nitrogen atom in a molecule indicates potential for vascular disorder related side effects. 
Rule 30: The presence of certain functional groups such as a sulfonamide group, nitro group or a chlorine atom in the structure of a molecule increases its chances of affecting the vascular system adversely.
Rule 1: If the molecular structure of a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NR2) and a benzene ring, it may cause side effects related to vascular disorders.

Rule 9: Larger, more hydrophobic molecules that are less water-soluble can potentially interact with cell membranes and cause damage.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a bromine atom and a nitro group, it may have vascular-related side effects.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a cyano group and a carbonyl group, it may have vascular-related side effects.
