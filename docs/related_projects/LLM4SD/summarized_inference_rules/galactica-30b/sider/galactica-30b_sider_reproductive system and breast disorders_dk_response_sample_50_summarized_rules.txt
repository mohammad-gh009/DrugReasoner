Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups like chlorine atoms or nitro groups in a molecule might suggest its potential to cause adverse effects on the reproductive system or breast tissue due to their endocrine-disrupting or toxic properties respectively.
Rule 2: The structure of a molecule, including elements like a sulfonamide group or a nitrile group, can determine its ability to cause adverse effects as they are known to be toxic and highly reactive respectively.
Rule 3: Length and complexity of a molecule also have a significant role in determining its toxicity as longer and more complex molecules can have higher chances of interaction with other molecules causing adverse effects.
Rule 4: The presence of any functional group such as aldehyde or ketone may lead to adverse effects, although higher molecular weight compounds may also lead to adverse effects due their ability to penetrate cell membranes.
Rule 5: Functional groups like nitro groups, halogens, or aromatic rings may lead to adverse effects due to their toxic properties.
Rule 6: Compounds with substructures such as "CC1(C(N2C(S1)C(C2=O)NC(=O)C(C3=CC=CC=C3)C(=O)[O-])C(=O)[O-])C" or "CC1CC2=C(CCC(=O)C2)C3C1C4CCC(C4(CC3)C)(C#C)O" due to their association with biological activities including anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and anticancer properties.
Rule 7: Presence of sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), multiple aromatic rings, negatively charged oxygen atoms ([O-2]) or chiral centers can lead to potential adverse effects due to their ability to structurally interact with biological systems like proteins and hormones.
Rule 8: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group or nitro group may exhibit toxicity due to their ability to interact with biological macromolecules thus causing alterations that can lead to adverse effects.
Rule 9: Compounds containing certain atoms or bonds such as nitrogen-nitrogen double bonds or sulfur-sulfur single bonds can lead to toxicity due to their high reactivity or unique chemical reactivity.
Rule 10: Molecules containing functional groups like "[Li+].[OH-]" or "[Fe]" or "CCOC(=O)CC(C(=O)OCC)SP(=S)(OC)OC" or "CCOC(=O)C(CCC1=CC=CC=C1)NC(C)C(=O)N2CC3=CC=CC=C3CC2C(=O)O" and "CC1=CC(=NO1)C(=O)NNCC2=CC=CC=C2" or "C(CC(C(F)F)(C(=O)O)N)CN" may lead to side effects related to hormonal imbalances or reproductive toxicity.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, phenol group, a sulfur atom, a functional group such as CC(=O) or C#N, or a nitro group (-NO2), it may have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom attached either to a carbon atom or present in its structure, it may negate the potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. 
Rule 3: The presence of a nitrogen-containing functional group (an amide or an imine group), a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), or a molecule with "C#N" or "Cc1ccccc1" in its SMILES representation could imply potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders.
Rule 4: If a molecule contains a benzene ring in its structure and is labeled as 1, it may also have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders.
Rule 5: Presence of a halogen atom, such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), in a molecule might mean it doesn't have side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders.
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a conjugated system consisting of alternating single and double bonds, particularly with an amide group (-CONH-), then it may also have potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders.
Rule 7: If a molecule has a benzene ring connected to a nitrogen atom through a single bond, then it may also have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders.  
Rule 8: Presence of metal ions like Gd+3 or Fe+3 might lead to potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders.
Rule 9: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (-C=O) or carboxylic acid group (COOH) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders.
Rule 10: A compound containing a cyano group (-CN) or a nitro group (-NO2) may also have side effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders.
Rule 11: A compound having a thiocarbonyl group (-CS-) in its structure might be associated with adverse effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders.
