Rule 1: Compounds with functional groups such as aldehydes or ketones may have increased potential for causing adverse effects on the respiratory system.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings could contribute to toxicity that harms the respiratory system.
Rule 3: Compounds having charged groups such as ammonium ions (-NR3+) or carboxylate anions (-COO-) may reduce the potential for harmful effects on the respiratory system.
Rule 4: Compounds with functional groups like carboxylic acid or its derivatives, nitro compounds, amines, and halogenated hydrocarbons may increase the likelihood of causing respiratory disorders.
Rule 5: High molecular weight and lipophilicity of the compound increases the risk of accumulation in the lungs, thereby causing irritation or inflammation.
Rule 6: Linear-shaped and small-sized molecules may have a higher likelihood of penetrating lung tissue, thus leading to potential adverse effects.
Rule 7: Molecules with a naphthalene ring or a benzene ring attached to a sulfonamide group may lead to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders due to their potential as irritants or allergens.
Rule 8: Molecules with a nitro group connected to a phenyl ring could cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders due to their potential toxicity.
Rule 9: Compounds with a carbonyl group linked to two carbon atoms might interfere with blood circulation and oxygen transport, possibly causing heart attack and stroke.
Rule 10: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a carbonyl group (COR), it may potentially cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 11: Molecules containing a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2) could potentially cause respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 12: Compounds with a phosphorus atom bonded to four oxygen atoms in a cyclic structure, or a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom in a polycyclic ring system, may lead to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 13: Negatively charged compounds like those with phosphate (-PO4^2-) or carboxylate (-COO-) present may cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders due to their cellular permeability.
Rule 14: Molecules containing a benzene ring (representing a larger class of aromatic rings) and conjugated double bonds may be associated with increased risk of respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 15: Potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders might be increased in molecules containing a metal ion such as Ga+3 or K+, a functional group like CC(C(=O)C1=CC(=CC=C1)Cl)NC(C)(C)C, CCC(=O)O[C@](CC1=CC=CC=C1)(C2=CC=CC=C2)[C@H](C)CN(C)C, or a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H).
Rule 16: The presence of halogen atoms like chlorine or fluorine can disrupt the functioning of cells and tissues and result in respiratory disorders.
Rule 17: Aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds in a molecular structure may increase the risks of adverse effects due to their capacity for absorbing UV radiation and forming radicals which can damage cellular components.
Rule 18: Compounds with benzene rings or similar aromatic systems may cause respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders due to their lipophilicity and ability to cross cell membranes.
Rule 19: Carbonyl groups can impact the solubility and reactivity of a compound, affecting its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with cells.
Rule 20: Halogen atoms can alter the electronic properties and potentially the chemical behaviour of a molecule, thus potentially leading to harmful interactions with biological systems. 
Rule 21: Hydrophilic compounds might be more likely to cause adverse effects due to their increased propensity to dissolve and interact with biological systems than hydrophobic compounds.
Rule 22: Compounds with low molecular weights, high hydrophilicity or those containing functional groups such as "-COOH" or "-SO3H", aromatic rings, or halogens might have an increased potential for causing harm to the respiratory system.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), it may potentially cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule is applicable to molecules 6 to 23 in the dataset provided.
Rule 2: A molecule that contains a benzene ring attached through a single bond to a carbonyl group (-C=O) has the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies to molecules 2 to 23 in the dataset.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a chlorine atom (-Cl) bonded to a carbon atom may cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 4: Presence of a functional group such as "-COOH" or "-OH" in a compound can potentially cause adverse effects on respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies specifically to compound rows 1, 6, 7, and 9 in the dataset.
Rule 5: If a compound has a long-chain carbon structure, it has the potential to adversely impact the respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal system. This rule applies directly to compound row 8 in the dataset.
Rule 6: Compounds with a nitro group (-NO2) may not have a significant impact on respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies to compound row 3 in the dataset.
Rule 7: If a compound contains functional groups like sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O), it increases its potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 8: Compounds containing negatively charged ions like phosphate (-PO4^2-) or carboxylate (-COO-) may have a higher chance of causing respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 9: Molecules with aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds can have an increased risk of causing respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
