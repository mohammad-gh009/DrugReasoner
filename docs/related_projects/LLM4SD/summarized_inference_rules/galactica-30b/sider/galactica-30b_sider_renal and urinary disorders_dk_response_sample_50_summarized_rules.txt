Rule 1: If a compound contains functional groups such as amides, sulfonamides, nitro groups or hydrophobic molecular structure, it may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on renal and urinary systems.
Rule 2: The presence of aromatic rings, especially substituted with halogen atoms, within a compound may increase the probability of causing adverse effects on kidneys and urinary system, due to their increased potential to interact with biological targets.
Rule 3: Molecules containing functional groups such as halogens (chlorine, fluorine), sulfonyl group, carbonyl group, benzene ring, cyano group, sulfonamide group, or nitro group may have potential side-effects associated with renal and urinary disorders due to their enhanced reactivity and potential to interfere with critical biological processes.
Rule 4: A molecule's structure, including aromatic rings, conjugated double bonds, presence of certain functional groups or ions, or hydrophobicity, can play a critical role in its potential to cause adverse effects on renal or urinary systems.
Rule 5: Compounds with high molecular weights and more hydrophobicity might accumulate in tissues and organs, leading to toxicity. High polarization can lead to accumulation in kidney tissues, causing damage. Some functional groups also have the potential to form covalent bonds with proteins leading to their deactivation. Hence, neutral or slightly basic molecules are preferred for therapeutic use.
Rule 6: The absence of specific functional groups in the molecular structure can reduce the likelihood of causing adverse effects on renal and urinary systems.
Rule 7: If the molecular structure has a high degree of symmetry, it may have a lower probability of causing adverse effects on renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 1: Molecules containing a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2) may lead to renal and urinary disorders, as these functional groups can increase the compound's acidity, polarity and absorption through the kidneys, leading to potential damage.

Rule 2: Molecules having a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) conjugated with an alkene or alkyne group may have adverse effects on the renal and urinary system by increasing the compound's hydrophobicity, thus enhancing its absorption by the body.

Rule 3: Molecules embracing a halogen atom like chlorine or fluorine can cause renal or urinary issues due to enhanced lipophilicity, which may increase their ability to infiltrate kidney tubules.

Rule 4: The presence of Ba+2 ions in a molecule could indicate its potential to interact with other molecules or ions in the body, causing renal and urinary disorders.

Rule 5: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) attached to an aromatic ring could disrupt normal insulin function resulting in renal and urinary disorders.

Rule 6: Due to a potential risk of cell damage in the kidneys and bladder, molecules containing a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring could cause renal and urinary disorders.

Rule 7: Molecules with a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom may have a potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders.

Rule 8: Molecules with a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to an alkyl and a phenyl group may lead to renal and urinary disorders.

Rule 9: Large, complex molecules or those with structural features like aromatic rings could impact the molecule's metabolic stability and toxicity, potentially affecting the renal and urinary systems.

Rule 10: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) are potentially prone to renal and urinary disorders.

Rule 11: Molecules that contain a fluoro group (-F) attached to a phenyl ring might cause renal and urinary disorders.

Rule 12: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) adjacent to a double bond or triple bond may potentially lead to renal and urinary disorders.

Rule 13: Molecules with a high degree of polarity or hydrophilicity may be less likely to harm renal and urinary systems due to their low probability to permeate cell membranes and enter the bloodstream.

Rule 14: If a molecule contains a functional group like a carboxylic acid or its derivatives, it may cause adverse effects on kidneys and urine.

Rule 15: Molecules with a high degree of conjugation between Ï€ bonds tend to have lower solubility in water and higher lipophilicity, leading to renal and urinary disorders.

Rule 16: Molecules having a nitro group (-NO2) in their structure have a higher probability for causing renal or urinary disorders due to the formation of reactive metabolites resulting in tissue injury.

Rule 17: Compounds containing a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) might cause renal and urinary disorders due to their ability to disrupt normal cellular functions.

Rule 18: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group in its structure, then it may likely cause adverse effects on kidneys and urinary system due to its ability to bind to proteins and interrupt normal cellular processes.

Rule 19: Presence of functional groups like sulfonamide, nitro, fluoride, and carboxylic acid in a molecule elevates its potential for adverse renal and urinary system effects.

Rule 20: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom linked to a carbon atom in the form of a double or triple bond, it may likely cause renal or urinary ailments.
