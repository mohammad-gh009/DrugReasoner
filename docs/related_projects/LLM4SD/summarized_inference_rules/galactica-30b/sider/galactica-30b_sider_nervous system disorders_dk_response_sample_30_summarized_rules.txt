Rule 1: Compounds with functional groups such as amines, amides, sulfonamides, and carbonyl groups may exhibit higher likelihood for nervous system adverse effects.
Rule 2: Compounds with aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds can interact with biological molecules, potentially causing adverse effects on the nervous system due to their ability to interact through π-π stacking interactions.
Rule 3: Compound's molecular weight and hydrophobicity play a role in potential to cause nervous system adverse effects. Larger and more hydrophobic compounds tend to have greater bioavailability and may cross the blood-brain barrier, potentially leading to neurological effects.
Rule 4: Compounds with polar functional groups like hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH2), and carboxyl (-COOH) are less likely to cross the blood-brain barrier and affect the central nervous system.
Rule 5: Compounds with functional groups like sulfonyl, nitro, halogen atoms, and carbonyl may have potential for causing adverse effects on the nervous system, due to their ability to interact with biological molecules, disrupt normal cellular processes or bind to receptors in the brain.
Rule 6: Compounds with complex structures, long carbon chains, multiple aromatic rings or multiple rings may exhibit higher risk for causing adverse nervous system effects.
Rule 7: Presence of certain chemical elements such as gold (Au), sulfur (S), sulfur or selenium atoms in a compound may indicate a high likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Rule 8: Presence of negatively charged atoms such as oxygen and sulfur increases a compound's likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Rule 9: Molecules with a high degree of symmetry or planarity can increase their potential for causing adverse effects, due to their ability to interact with multiple targets simultaneously. 
Rule 10: Molecules with a high degree of lipophilicity are more likely to cross the blood-brain barrier and consequently potentially cause more adverse nervous system effects.
