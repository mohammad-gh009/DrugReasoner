Rule 1: Molecules with certain functional groups such as CCONHC(=O), CNS(=O)(=O)C, COCP(=O)(OP(=O)(OC1CCCCC1)OC1CCCCC1), etc., and Positive nitrogen atom may have a higher chance of being approved by the FDA.
Rule 2: Presence of halogen atoms, enhances metabolic stability and reduces toxicity, making molecules favourable candidates for approvals. However, Molecules with fluoride atoms may fail clinical trials and halogens like chlorine may cause their toxicity to increase.
Rule 3: The presence of toxic functional groups like NO2, NH3OH+, CH3COOH, H2SO4, HCN etc, may decrease the chances of approval. Similarly, other toxic groups include silicons bonded to two oxygen atoms, sulphanyl groups, carbonyl groups and cyano groups should be avoided. Also, molecules that contain aromatic rings tend to show increased toxicity.
Rule 4: Molecules with low molecular weight and simple structures, no more than two rings or carbon chains, fewer chiral centres, shorter and simpler structures show lower toxicity and are favored by the FDA.
Rule 5: The molecular weight and lipophilicity of a compound affect its absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) with lower molecular weights and higher lipophilicities showing better ADMET properties.
Rule 6: Molecules with certain steriochemistry e.g. chiral drugs showing different activities based on their configurations can affect emissions. The presence of only carbon and hydrogen atoms can lead to approval.
Rule 7: Positively charged nitrogen, polar functional groups like carbonyl, carboxyl, hydroxyl, and sulfhydryl groups tend to exhibit better solubility and permeability across cell membranes increasing chances for approval.
Rule 8: The number of rotatable bonds in a compound can determine its chances of FDA approval with compounds having fewer than five seen as ideal for oral absorption. 
Rule 9: Compound flexibility and presence of aromatic rings can make for better interaction with target proteins but increased toxicity due to non-specific binding can damage approvals.
Rule 10: Negatively charged functional groups such as sulfonyl or phosphate groups may increase approval chances due to their ability to interact with positively charged amino acid resides on target proteins.
Rule 1: Compounds with halogen atoms, such as fluorine or chlorine, increase lipophilicity and enhance cross-cell membrane ability, possibly improving pharmacokinetics. However, an excess of halogens can increase toxicity risk due to their electronegativity and potential for metabolic reactions.
Rule 2: Compound stability and reactivity depend on its functional groups and chemical structure, with carbonyl and carbon double bond groups balancing stability and reactivity. 
Rule 3: Charge and polarity of a compound affect its solubility and bioavailability. Charged functional groups such as amines (NH+) or carboxylic acids (COOH) improve solubility, though they may have limited membrane permeability.
Rule 4: Compounds that feature a functional group CCONHC(=O)R' tend to have a good chance for FDA approval due to prevalence in successfully marketed drugs.
Rule 5: Compounds that contain a halogen atom such as chlorine or iodine may not be approved by the FDA due to their association with toxicity.
Rule 6: Compounds with a sulfonamide group (SO2NR''R''') potentially have a moderate chance of FDA approval due to their use in antibiotics, despite potential serious side effects.
Rule 7: Compounds with a carbonyl group have potential stability, thereby increasing their potential to pass clinical trials. 
Rule 8: The presence of a sulfonyl or sulfate group may lead to a toxicity issue, due to the compound's potential level of reactivity.
Rule 9: Fluorinated compounds tend to have higher metabolic stability making them attractive for drug development.
Rule 10: Compounds that do not contain functional groups like nitro groups are preferred due to lower toxicity.
Rule 11: Compounds with low molecular weight and high lipophilicity usually have higher chances of passing clinical trials.
Rule 12: Compounds with fewer hydrogen bond donors and acceptors are more likely to pass clinical trials.
Rule 13: Compounds containing chlorine atoms can increase metabolic stability and reduce toxicity.
Rule 14: Compounds with functional groups such as carbonyls or carboxylic acids may exhibit high toxicity due to their ability to indiscriminately bind proteins.
Rule 15: Aromatic molecules may have better membrane permeability compared to aliphatic ones but may have higher toxicity. 
Rule 16: Compounds with polar functional groups may have better aqueous solubility, but can increase likelihood of off-target interactions and toxicity.
Rule 17: Structural features such as number and position of double bonds in a compound can significantly affect its physical and chemical properties.
Rule 18: Molecules containing halogen atoms resistant to metabolic degradation and have longer half-lives in the body.
Rule 19: Neutral compounds tend to be more water-soluble than charged ones.
Rule 20: Molecules containing certain functional groups, metal ions or toxicophore groups will fail clinical trials due to potential side effects or adverse reactions in humans.
Rule 21: Positively charged functional groups including ammonium or amine groups increase chances of toxicity and hindrance of FDA approval.
Rule 22: Molecules with high aqueous solubility due to polar functional groups may be more likely to be approved by FDA.
Rule 23: Absence of toxic functional groups like sulfonyl, nitro, and halogen groups increase the likelihood of FDA approval.
Rule 24: Molecules with complex structures or multiple chiral centers pose challenges for FDA approval due to degradation susceptibility.
Rule 25: Despite absence of specific functional groups or structural features, potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties must be taken into account.
Rule 26: Halogens cause compounds to fail clinical trials due to their toxic nature.
Rule 27: Complex structured compounds may fail clinical trials due to their low solubility or high toxicity.
Rule 28: Neutral molecules tend to be more stable, and more likely to gain FDA approval.
Rule 29: Nitrogen-containing heterocycles can have favorable pharmacokinetic profiles and increase chances of FDA approval.
Rule 30: Carbonyl groups alone may lead to toxicity issues, and hence carbonyl-containing compounds should generally be avoided.
Rule 31: Halogenated molecules with multiple halogen atoms have increased lipophilicity and better cell penetration but increased risk of toxicity.
Rule 32: The presence of certain functional groups may fail clinical trials due to toxicity issues, and hence a label of 0 should be assigned to them.
Rule 33: Molecules with complex structures and multiple chiral centers should be assigned a label of 0 due to increased degradation susceptibility.
Rule 34: Toxicophore groups such as sulfonyl or carbonyl groups lead to adverse reactions in humans and should be labeled as 0.
Rule 35: Molecules containing a charged functional group such as ammonium or carboxylate may fail clinical trials due to poor Pharmacokinetic properties.
Rule 36: Molecular weight should not exceed 500 Daltons to avoid toxicity and solubility issues.
Rule 37: A balance between hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity is necessary for optimal ADMET properties.
Rule 38: Compounds containing negatively-charged oxygen atoms bonded to two carbon atoms may have potential therapeutic benefits and hence should be labeled as 1.
Rule 39: High toxicity or low solubility compounds such as those having sulfonamide or nitro groups or that contain a fluorine atom attached to a cyclic ring, or a positively charged nitrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom should be avoided and labelled as 0.
Rule 40: Compounds with nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as pyrimidines, triazoles, or indoles often have better pharmacokinetic profiles and are good drug candidates.
Rule 41: FDA approval is unlikely for compounds featuring toxic functional groups or complex structures, while compounds with neutral or positive charges are more likely to be considered safe.
