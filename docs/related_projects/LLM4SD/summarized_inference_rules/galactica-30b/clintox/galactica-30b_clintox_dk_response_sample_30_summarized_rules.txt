Rule 1: Compounds with fluorine should be carefully evaluated before FDA approval due to increased risks of toxicity despite improved pharmacokinetic profile.
Rule 2: Compounds with mercury or platinum are associated with higher toxicity and should not be used in drug development unless clear therapeutic benefit is evident.
Rule 3: A balance between hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in a compound is important for optimal bioavailability and minimized adverse effects due to influences on solubility and absorption.
Rule 4: Compounds with a carbon-carbon double bond without toxic functional groups like nitro groups have high chances of FDA approval.
Rule 5: Compounds with a tetrasubstituted nitrogen atom have lower chance of FDA approval due to potential toxicity.
Rule 6: Compounds with halogen atoms have a higher chance of FDA approval unless associated with increased toxicity like with fluorine.
Rule 7: Compounds with functional groups like amides and esters should be considered for potential toxicity during FDA approval.
Rule 8: The presence and position of nitrogen atoms in a compound affect its interaction with molecules and potential toxicity.
Rule 9: Length and flexibility of a molecule's carbon chain affect its ability to cross cell membranes and reach target sites.
Rule 10: Chlorine atoms in a compound increases its chances of FDA approval due to increased metabolic stability and reduced toxicity.
Rule 11: Functional groups like amides or esters are often less toxic and more stable leading to higher chances of FDA approval.
Rule 12: A lower number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in a compound decreases the likelihood of toxicity and increases chances for FDA approval.
Rule 13: Iodine atoms in a compound may indicate potential toxicity issues, reducing its chances for FDA approval.
Rule 14: Functional groups like sulfonates or phosphates may pose toxicity risks and should be avoided when designing drugs.
Rule 15: Nitrogen in compounds should have appropriate substituents attached to ensure safety.
Rule 16: Functional groups like halogens should be considered for approval by the FDA provided they meet safety standards, despite their increased reactivity.
Rule 17: Simpler and shorter structures in compounds are considered safer and more likely for FDA approval than complex ones.
Rule 18: Compounds containing boron may not be suitable for pharmaceutical use due to potential formation of toxic boric acid.
Rule 19: Molecules without functional groups like amines and amides are more likely to be approved by FDA.
Rule 20: Molecules without halogens are more likely to pass FDA approval due to lower toxicity risks.
Rule 21: Molecules with fewer than three chiral centers tend to have better chances of FDA approval due to their ease of synthesis.
Rule 22: Positively charged nitrogen atoms may lead to toxicity, reducing chances of FDA approval.
Rule 23: Compounds without sulfonyl, amide, and amine groups have a higher chance of FDA approval.
Rule 24: The presence of polar functional groups requires careful consideration in drug design due to potential side effects.
Rule 25: Optimal therapeutic potential of a drug candidate requires a balance between size, polarity, and hydrophobicity.
Rule 26: Molecules with positively charged nitrogen atom may fail clinical trials due to toxicity issues, reducing chances of FDA approval.
Rule 27: Halogen atoms in a molecule can increase lipophilicity and chance of crossing the blood-brain barrier, but also increase toxicity risks.
Rule 28: Compounds with charged functional groups such as ammonium or carboxylate ions may be limited in their effectiveness as drugs due to potential side effects.
Rule 29: Compounds with moderate size and hydrophilicity have a greater likelihood of passing clinical trial testing.
Rule 30: Fluorine-containing compounds have better pharmacokinetic profiles but may also lead to adverse reactions.
Rule 31: Cationic compounds are often more toxic, reducing chances of FDA approval.
