1: The presence of a sulfonamide group or an amide group in a molecule may indicate its ability to inhibit BACE-1. 
Rule 2: Molecules containing heterocyclic rings may have higher chances of inhibiting BACE-1 than those without such rings.
Rule 3: The presence of a polar functional group, especially -OH or -NH2 group attached to a phenyl ring may play a advantaging role in inhibiting BACE-1.
Rule 4: A fluorine atom on the para position of a benzene ring may increase the likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1.
Rule 5: The presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom in the structure of a molecule may suggest its potential to inhibit BACE-1. 
Rule 6: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) in conjugation with a double bond or aromatic ring, it increases the likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1.
Rule 7: The presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom also increases the likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1.
Rule 8: The presence of fluorine atoms in the structure may increase the likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1 activity.
Rule 9: The presence of a cyclic amine group or a guanidine group in the structure may increase the likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1 activity.
Rule 10: The presence of a carbonyl group adjacent to a double bond in the structure may decrease the likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1 activity.
Rule 11: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it may indicate its ability to inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 12: The absence of certain functional groups or atoms in the structure of a molecule may affect its ability to inhibit BACE-1. 
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a guanidine group, it may indicate that it can inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 14: Molecules containing a benzimidazole moiety have been shown to exhibit potent BACE-1 inhibition. 
Rule 15: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, then it cannot inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 16: The absence of a carbonyl group but the presence of other functional groups like amines or amides may suggest the potential of a molecule to inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 17: The position and orientation of functional groups in a molecule play a crucial role in determining its inhibitory activity against BACE-1. 
Rule 18: If a molecule contains a functional group such as -COOH or -CONH2 in its structure, then it can potentially inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 19: If a molecule contains a functional group such as an amide or an amine in the structure of a molecule, it may indicate its ability to inhibit BACE-1. 
Rule 20: The length and flexibility of the carbon chain connecting the functional group or heterocycle to the rest of the molecule may also affect its ability to inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 1: The possible inhibitory effect on BACE-1 is indicated by the presence of a beta-secretase inhibitor group, like "-NHCHRCOOH" or "-CONHR", in the molecule's structure.
Rule 2: Despite not having inhibitory effects on BACE-1, a molecule with the sulfonamide group "-SO2NR" could still interact with other biological targets related to Alzheimer's disease pathology.
Rule 3: Even in the absence of functional groups found in known BACE-1 inhibitors, molecules might still have mechanisms of action relevant to treating Alzheimer's disease.
Rule 4: High likelihood of BACE-1 inhibition exists for molecules containing a functional group like -COOH, -CONH2, or -SO3H. These groups are known for their interactions with active BACE-1 sites.
Rule 5: High BACE-1 inhibitions are observed in molecules with a heterocyclic ring system like thiophene, pyridine, or pyrimidine. These rings interact with BACE-1's active sites.
Rule 6: Molecules containing a long carbon chain attached to a polar functional group might not inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 7: Presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in a molecule raises its chance of inhibiting BACE-1.
Rule 8: A higher BACE-1 inhibition likelihood exists for a molecule containing a guanidine group (-C(NH2)=NNHC(NH2)=NH-).
Rule 9: Molecules that contain both a sulfonamide group and a guanidine group are more likely to have BACE-1 inhibitory activity.
Rule 10: BACE-1 inhibitory activity of a compound may be indicated by the presence of a beta-secretase inhibitor group such as N=C-N or C=ONHC.
Rule 11: A negatively charged functional group such as SO3- or COO- attached to a carbon atom next to a nitrogen atom could indicate BACE-1 inhibitory potential. 
Rule 12: A molecule with a heterocyclic ring system containing at least one nitrogen atom and a carbonyl group connected by a single bond could act as a BACE-1 inhibitor.
Rule 13: If a molecule contains a guanidine or amidine group, it could potentially inhibit BACE-1.
