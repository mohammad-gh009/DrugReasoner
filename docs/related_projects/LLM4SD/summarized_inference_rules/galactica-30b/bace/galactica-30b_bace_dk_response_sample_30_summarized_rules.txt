Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in a molecule suggests its potential to inhibit BACE-1. Specifically, this applies to molecules S1 and specific other molecular structures. 

Rule 2: Molecules containing a benzenesulfonamide group, attached to a phenyl ring via a carbonyl group, could also have the potential to inhibit BACE-1.

Rule 3: Molecules containing a carbamate group (-O-CO-NH-) or a urea group (-HN-CO-NH-) are likely not able to inhibit BACE-1.

Rule 4: A sulfonyl group (-SO2-) presence in a molecule means that it can inhibit BACE-1. 

Rule 5: Molecules containing a benzimidazole ring may not inhibit BACE-1.

Rule 6: Molecules with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) attached to a phenyl ring could inhibit BACE-1.

Rule 7: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a molecule structure can inhibit BACE-1.

Rule 8: Molecules with a carbonyl group in structure may or may not inhibit BACE-1, depending on the position of the carbon atom attached to the oxygen atom in the structure.

Rule 9: Fluorine presence on an aromatic ring in a molecule structure does not affect its ability to inhibit BACE-1.

Rule 10: A positively charged amino group (-NH3+) in a molecule structure increases the probability of inhibiting BACE-1.

Rule 11: A molecule with a carbonyl group (C=O) connected to a five-membered ring has a high probability of inhibiting BACE-1.

Rule 12: The absence of a fluorine atom (-F) attached to a carbon atom next to a double bond or triple bond can mean the molecule cannot inhibit BACE-1.

Rule 13: The presence of either a beta-secretase inhibitor group "-C1CC1C=1N=C(N)N(C)C(=O)C=1" or "-C1NNC(=O)C1" indicates potential inhibition of BACE-1.

Rule 14: Molecules containing sulfonamide groups may have inhibitory activity against BACE-1.

Rule 15: The presence of a functional group such as -COOH or -CONH2 can indicate a molecule's potential to inhibit BACE-1.

Rule 16: Molecules with positively charged nitrogen atoms (NH2+ or NH3+) can enhance their ability to inhibit BACE-1.

Rule 17: A molecule's ability to inhibit BACE-1 may depend on the presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to a nitrogen atom.

Rule 18: If a molecule has a carbonyl group (C=O) in its structure, it likely has a high probability of inhibiting BACE-1.

Rule 19: If a molecule has a sulfonamide group (SO2R), it likely can't inhibit BACE-1.

Rule 20: A carbamate group (-NRCO2R') in a molecule structure may increase its potential to inhibit BACE-1. 

Rule 21: A positively charged functional group such as ammonium or guanidinium in a compound decreases the likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1 due to electrostatic repulsion.

Rule 22: Molecules containing a carbonyl group (C=O) conjugated with an aromatic ring system can exhibit inhibitory activity against BACE-1.

Rule 23: A molecule containing a sulfonamide group (R-SO2-NR'R'') can show potent inhibition of BACE-1.

Rule 24: If there is a carbonyl group (C=O) present in the structure of the molecule, it likely has a high probability of inhibiting BACE-1. 

Rule 25: A molecule containing a positively charged nitrogen atom (e.g., NH4+ or NR3+) has a higher chance of being able to inhibit BACE-1.

Rule 26: The presence of a fluorine atom (F) bonded to carbon atoms likely decreases the likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1.

I hope this summary is useful!
Rule 1: Compounds that have a beta-secretase inhibitor group such as N-benzyl or N-phenylcarbamoyl are more likely to inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 2: Compounds with a negatively charged functional group like sulfonyl or carboxylate attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a nitrogen atom are less likely to inhibit BACE-1 due to possible interference with binding.
Rule 3: Compounds that have a cyclic structure such as pyrrolidine or piperazine are more inclined to inhibit BACE-1 due to their structural fit for the active site.
Rule 4: Possession of a fluorine atom on the phenyl ring can suggest potential inhibitory activity against BACE-1 but it's not guaranteed.
Rule 5: Molecules which contain a sulfonamide group have the potential for higher BACE-1 inhibitory activity due to hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.
Rule 6: Molecules having a carbamate group may inhibit BACE-1 by mimicking the tetrahedral intermediate formed during catalysis.
Rule 7: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a molecule can indicate that it may inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 8: Molecules with a carbamate group that contains a long chain alkyl or aryl group may not inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 9: Molecules incorporating a ferrocene group will likely not inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 10: A molecule with a positively charged nitrogen atom may have an increased likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1.
Rule 11: Absence of a negatively charged functional group in a molecule can decrease its likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1.
Rule 12: A fluorine atom in the structure of a molecule doesn't significantly affect its likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1.
Rule 13: A molecule with a beta-secretase inhibitor group such as "-C(=O)CNC(=O)" or "-C(=O)NNC(=O)" can potentially inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 14: A molecule containing a sulfonamide group "SO2NR2R'" may not inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 15: Molecules possessing a benzimidazole ring "C8H6N2" may also not inhibit BACE-1, although this rule needs further validation.
