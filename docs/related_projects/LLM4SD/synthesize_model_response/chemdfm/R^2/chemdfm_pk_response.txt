task name: R^2
Response from model: 
 The list of rules are:
1. Molecular size increases with increasing number of atoms.
2. Electronegative atoms draw electron density away from邻原子, reducing size.
3. Polar molecules have a larger spatial extent than nonpolar molecules of similar size.
4. Molecules with multiple bonds between同一原子 and邻原子 are smaller than single bonds.
5. Planar molecules have a smaller spatial extent than those with non-planar geometry.
6. Aromatic molecules have a larger spatial extent than those without aromaticity.
7. Alkyl groups increase molecular size but do not significantly affect shape.
8. Cyclic structures have a smaller spatial extent than linear structures of similar size.
9. The presence of chiral centers increases molecular complexity and spatial extent.
10. The type and position of functional groups influence molecular size and shape.
11. Hydrogen bonding increases molecular size and complexity.
12. The presence of heavy atoms increases molecular size.
13. The shape of molecules affects their spatial extent, with more branched molecules having a smaller extent.
14. The presence of conjugated systems increases molecular size and complexity.
15. The formal charge of atoms affects molecular size and complexity.
16. The type and number of ring systems in a molecule influence its spatial extent.
17. The presence of multiple bonds between different原子 types affects molecular size.
18. The type and number of heteroatoms in a molecule influence its spatial extent.
19. The presence of cyclic acetal or ketal groups increases molecular size and complexity.
20. The formal sum of the van der Waals radii of the atoms in a molecule gives an estimate of its spatial extent.
