 The list of rules are:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds have higher isotropic polarizability than those with single bonds.
2. Aromatic compounds tend to have higher isotropic polarizability than their non-aromatic counterparts.
3. Compounds containing halogens generally have higher isotropic polarizability compared to those without.
4. Larger molecules usually have higher isotropic polarizability than smaller ones.
5. Compounds with more branching tend to have lower isotropic polarizability.
6. Compounds with more double bonds have higher isotropic polarizability than those with single bonds.
7. Compounds with unsaturated fatty acid chains tend to have higher isotropic polarizability than saturated fatty acid chains.
8. Cations generally have higher isotropic polarizability than neutral molecules.
