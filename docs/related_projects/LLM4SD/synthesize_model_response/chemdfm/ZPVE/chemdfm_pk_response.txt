task name: ZPVE
Response from model: 
 The list of rules are:
1. Molecules with more atoms have higher ZPVE.
2. Increased molar mass leads to higher ZPVE.
3. Higher frequency modes result in higher ZPVE.
4. Nonpolar molecules have higher ZPVE than polar molecules.
5. Larger molecules have higher ZPVE than smaller ones.
6. Increased connectivity between atoms leads to higher ZPVE.
7. Double bonds have higher ZPVE than single bonds.
8. Aromaticity increases ZPVE.
9. branching lowers ZPVE.
10. Heteroatoms raise ZPVE due to higher polarity.
11. Alkynes have higher ZPVE than alkanes.
12. Cyclic structures raise ZPVE.
13. HighlySymmetric molecules have lower ZPVE.
14. Covalently bonded molecules have higher ZPVE than ionic species.
15. Larger van der Waals surfaces raise ZPVE.
16. Higher electronegativity increases ZPVE.
17. Increased charge delocalization raises ZPVE.
18. Cohesive energy of solvent affects ZPVE.
19. Temperature affects ZPVE.
20. Pressure affects ZPVE.
