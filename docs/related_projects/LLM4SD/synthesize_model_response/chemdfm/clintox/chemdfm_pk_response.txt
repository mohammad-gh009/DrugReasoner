task name: clintox
Response from model: 
 Sure! Here are 20 rules that may help predict if a molecule will be approved by the FDA or failed clinical trials for toxicity reasons:
1. Calculate logP.
2. Check for reactive functional groups.
3. Determine drug-likeness.
4. Evaluate metabolic stability.
5. Assess CYP inhibition potential.
6. Predict acid-base character.
7. Calculate molecular weight.
8. Assess hydrogen bond donor/acceptor capabilities.
9. Evaluate solubility.
10. Determine drug scaffold.
11. Predict logD.
12. Check for reactive intermediates.
13. Evaluate toxicity risk.
14. Predict metabolites.
15. Determine molecular flexibility.
16. Assess ionization state.
17. Predict drug targets.
