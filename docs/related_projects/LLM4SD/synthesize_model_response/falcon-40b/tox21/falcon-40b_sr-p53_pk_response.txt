task name: tox21_sr-p53
Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict toxicity activity of a molecule against the DNA damage p53-pathway in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in the molecule.
2. Calculate the number of aromatic rings in the molecule.
3. Calculate the number of rotatable bonds in the molecule.
4. Calculate the molecular weight of the molecule.
