Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict toxicity activity of a molecule against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
