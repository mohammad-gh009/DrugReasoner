task name: sider_neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps)
Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict the toxicity activity of a molecule in causing neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate the number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors in the molecule.
2. Calculate the number of aromatic rings in the molecule.
3. Calculate the number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule.
4. Calculate the number of sulfur atoms in the molecule.
5. Calculate the number of oxygen atoms in the molecule.
6. Calculate the number of halogen atoms in the molecule.
7. Calculate the number of carbon atoms in the molecule.
8. Calculate the number of heteroatoms in the molecule.
9. Calculate the number of chiral centers in the molecule.
10. Calculate the number of stereocenters in the molecule.
11. Calculate the number of rotatable bonds in the molecule.
12. Calculate the molecular weight of the molecule.
13. Calculate the logP value of the molecule.
14. Calculate the polar surface area of the molecule.
15. Calculate the hydrogen bonding capacity of the molecule.
