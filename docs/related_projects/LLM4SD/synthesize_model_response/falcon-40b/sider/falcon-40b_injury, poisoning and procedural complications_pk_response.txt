task name: sider_injury, poisoning and procedural complications
Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict the toxicity activity of a molecule in causing injury, poisoning and procedural complications. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate the number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors in the molecule.
2. Calculate the number of aromatic rings in the molecule.
3. Calculate the number of polar atoms in the molecule.
4. Calculate the number of rotatable bonds in the molecule.
5. Calculate the molecular weight of the molecule.
6. Calculate the logP value of the molecule.
7. Calculate the pKa value of the molecule.
8. Calculate the melting point of the molecule.
9. Calculate the boiling point of the molecule.
10. Calculate the vapor pressure of the molecule.
11. Calculate the solubility of the molecule in water.
12. Calculate the lipophilicity of the molecule.
13. Calculate the toxicity potential of the molecule using QSAR models.
14. Calculate the toxicity potential of the molecule using animal studies.
15. Calculate the toxicity potential of the molecule using human studies.
16. Calculate the toxicity potential of the molecule using in vitro assays.
17. Calculate the toxicity potential of the molecule using computational models.
18. Calculate the toxicity potential of the molecule using clinical trials.
19. Calculate the toxicity potential of the molecule using epidemiological studies.
20. Calculate the toxicity potential of the molecule using case reports and post-marketing surveillance data.
