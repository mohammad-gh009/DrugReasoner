task name: alpha
Response from model: 
Assume you are an experienced chemist. please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict Isotropic polarizability of a molecule. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules without access to 3D information. and should be short (no more than 15 words). Each rule needs to be very specific. please start with 'The list of rules are....'.
1. Electronegativity difference between atoms in the molecule should be greater than 0.4.
2. The electronegativity difference between the central atom and the polar atom should be greater than 0.4.
3. The electronegativity difference between the polar atom and the non-polar atom should be greater than 0.4.
4. The electronegativity difference between the polar atom and the central atom should be greater than 0.4.
5. The electronegativity difference between the central atom and the non-polar atom should be greater than 0.4.
6. The electronegativity difference between the polar atom and the central atom should be greater than 0.4.
7. The electronegativity difference between the polar atom and the non-polar atom should be greater than 0.4.
8. The electronegativity difference between the central atom and the polar atom should be greater than 0.4.
9. The electronegativity difference between the polar atom and the non-polar atom should be greater than 0.4.
10. The electronegativity difference between the central atom and the polar atom should be greater than 0.4.
11. The electronegativity difference between the polar atom and the non-polar atom should be greater than 0.4.
12. The electronegativity difference between the central atom and the polar atom should be greater than 0.4.
13. The electronegativity difference between the polar atom and the non-polar atom should be greater than 0.4.
14. The electronegativity difference between the central atom and the polar atom should be greater than 0.4.
15. The electronegativity difference between the polar atom and the non-polar atom should be greater than 0.4.
16. The electronegativity difference between the central atom and the polar atom should be greater than 0.4.
17. The electronegativity difference between the polar atom and the non-polar atom should be greater than 0.4.
18. The electronegativity difference between the central atom and the polar atom should be greater than 0.4.
19. The electronegativity difference between the polar atom and the non-polar atom should be greater than 0.4.
20. The electronegativity difference between the central atom and the polar atom should be greater than 0.4.
