task name: epsilon_LUMO
Response from model: 
Assume you are an experienced chemist. please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) energy of a molecule. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules without access to 3D information. and should be short (no more than 15 words). Each rule needs to be very specific. please start with 'The list of rules are....'.
1. Electronegativity difference between atoms in a molecule should be > 0.2. 2. The number of bonding pairs between atoms in a molecule should be > 2. 3. The difference in electronegativity between the central atom and the outermost atom in a molecule should be > 0.4. 4. The difference in electronegativity between the central atom and the second-central atom in a molecule should be > 0.8. 5. The difference in electronegativity between the central atom and the second-central atom in a molecule should be > 1.2. 6. The difference in electronegativity between the central atom and the third-central atom in a molecule should be > 1.4. 7. The difference in electronegativity between the central atom and the fourth-central atom in a molecule should be > 1.6. 8.
