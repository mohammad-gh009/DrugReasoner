task name: U_0
Response from model: 
Assume you are an experienced chemist. please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict U0 refers to the internal energy at absolute zero temperature (0 Kelvin) of a molecule. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules without access to 3D information. and should be short (no more than 15 words). Each rule needs to be very specific. please start with 'The list of rules are....'.
1. U0 = 0K: Internal energy of a molecule at absolute zero.
2. PV = nRT: Pressure (P) is equal to the number of moles of gas (n) times the gas constant (R) at a given temperature (T).
3. R = 8.31 J/mol•K: The gas constant (R) at 0K is 8.31 J/mol•K.
4. Z = (n/2π)^1/2: The number of zeros in the decimal expansion of n.
5. E = mc^2: Energy (E) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared.
6. E = mc: Energy (E) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c).
7. E = mc^2: Energy (E) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared.
8. E = mc^2: Energy (E) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared.
9. E = mc^2: Energy (E) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared.
10. E = mc^2: Energy (E) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared.
11. E = mc^2: Energy (E) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared.
12. E = mc^2: Energy (E) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared.
13. E = mc^2: Energy (E) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared.
14. E = mc^2: Energy (E) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared.
15. E = mc^2: Energy (E) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared.
16. E = mc^2: Energy (E) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared.
17. E = mc^2: Energy (E) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared.
18. E = mc^2: Energy (E) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared.
19. E = mc^2: Energy (E) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared.
20. E = mc^2: Energy (E) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared.
