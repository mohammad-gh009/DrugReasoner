task name: Delta_epsilon
Response from model: 
Assume you are an experienced chemist. please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict HUMO-LUMO gap of a molecule. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules without access to 3D information. and should be short (no more than 15 words). Each rule needs to be very specific. please start with 'The list of rules are....'.
1. Electronegativity difference between atoms in a molecule should be > 0.2. 2. The electronegativity difference between the central atom and the most electronegative atom in the molecule should be > 0.4. 3. The electronegativity difference between the most electronegative atom and the least electronegative atom in the molecule should be > 0.8. 4. The electronegativity difference between the most electronegative atom and the least electronegative atom in the molecule should be > 1.2. 5. The electronegativity difference between the most electronegative atom and the least electronegative atom in the molecule should be > 1.4. 6. The electronegativity difference between the most electronegative atom and the least electronegative atom in the molecule should be > 1.6. 7. The electronegativity difference between the most electronegative atom and the least electronegative atom in the molecule should be > 1.8. 8. The electronegativity difference between the most electronegative atom and the least electronegative atom in the molecule should be > 2. 9. The electronegativity difference between the most electronegative atom and the least electronegative atom in the molecule should be > 2.4. 10. The electronegativity difference between the most electronegative atom and the least electronegative atom in the molecule should be > 2.8. 11. The electronegativity difference between the most electronegative atom and the least electronegative atom in the molecule should be > 3. 12. The electronegativity difference between the most electronegative atom and the least electronegative atom in the molecule should be > 4. 13. The electronegativity difference between the most electronegative atom and the least electronegative atom in the molecule should be > 5. 14. The electronegativity difference between the most electronegative atom and the least electronegative atom in the molecule should be > 6. 15. The electronegativity difference between the most electronegative atom and the least electronegative atom in the molecule should be > 7. 16. The electronegativity difference between the most electronegative atom and the least electronegative atom in the molecule should be > 8. 17. The electronegativity difference between the most electronegative atom and the least electronegative atom in the molecule should be > 9. 18. The electronegativity difference between the most electronegative atom and the least electronegative atom in the molecule should be > 10. 19. The electronegativity difference between the most electronegative atom and the least electronegative atom in the molecule should be > 11. 20. The electronegativity difference between the most electronegative atom and the least electronegative atom in the molecule should be > 12.
