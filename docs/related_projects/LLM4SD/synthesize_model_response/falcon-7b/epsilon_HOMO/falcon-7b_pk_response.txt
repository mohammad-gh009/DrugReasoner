task name: epsilon_HOMO
Response from model: 
Assume you are an experienced chemist. please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict Highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy of a molecule. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules without access to 3D information. and should be short (no more than 15 words). Each rule needs to be very specific. please start with 'The list of rules are....'.
1. Electronegativity difference between atoms in a molecule affects HOMO energy.
2. HOMO energy depends on the number of bonding pairs between atoms.
3. HOMO energy decreases as the number of bonding pairs between atoms increases.
4. HOMO energy is higher in molecules with more electronegativity difference between atoms.
5. HOMO energy is higher in molecules with more bonding pairs between atoms.
6. HOMO energy is lower in molecules with fewer bonding pairs between atoms.
7. HOMO energy is higher in molecules with more electronegativity difference between atoms.
8. HOMO energy is higher in molecules with more bonding pairs between atoms.
9. HOMO energy is lower in molecules with fewer bonding pairs between atoms.
10. HOMO energy is higher in molecules with more electronegativity difference between atoms.
11. HOMO energy is higher in molecules with more bonding pairs between atoms.
12. HOMO energy is higher in molecules with more electronegativity difference between atoms.
13. HOMO energy is higher in molecules with more bonding pairs between atoms.
