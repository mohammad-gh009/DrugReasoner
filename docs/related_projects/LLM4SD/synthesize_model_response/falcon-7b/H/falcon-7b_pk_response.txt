task name: H
Response from model: 
Assume you are an experienced chemist. please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict H, the enthalpy of the molecule at a specific temperature, specifically 298.15 Kelvin (approximately room temperature) of a molecule. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules without access to 3D information. and should be short (no more than 15 words). Each rule needs to be very specific. please start with 'The list of rules are....'.
1. H = H2O (water)
2. H = CO2 (carbon dioxide)
3. H = O2 (oxygen)
4. H = N2 (nitrogen)
5. H = Na (sodium)
6. H = Mg (magnesium)
7. H = Al (aluminum)
8. H = Fe (iron)
9. H = Cl (chlorine)
10. H = Br (bromine)
11. H = Kr (krypton)
12. H = Xe (xenon)
13. H = Rn (radon)
14. H = Fr (frenchium)
15. H = Ra (radium)
16. H = Ac (acetic acid)
17. H = Hg (mercury)
18. H = Sn (tin)
19. H = Sb (antimony)
20. H = Te (tellurium)
