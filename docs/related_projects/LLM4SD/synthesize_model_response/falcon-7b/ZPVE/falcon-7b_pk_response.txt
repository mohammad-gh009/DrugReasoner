task name: ZPVE
Response from model: 
Assume you are an experienced chemist. please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict Zero-Point Vibrational Energy (ZPVE) of a molecule. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules without access to 3D information. and should be short (no more than 15 words). Each rule needs to be very specific. please start with 'The list of rules are....'.
1. Electronegativity: ZPVE depends on the atom's ability to attract electrons.
2. Atomic mass: ZPVE depends on the mass of the atom.
3. Nuclear charge: ZPVE depends on the number of protons in the nucleus.
4. Atomic radius: ZPVE depends on the size of the atom.
5. Hybridization: ZPVE depends on the number and arrangement of atomic orbitals.
6. Electronegativity difference: ZPVE depends on the difference in electronegativity between two atoms.
7. Bond length: ZPVE depends on the bond length between two atoms.
8. Bond angle: ZPVE depends on the bond angle between two atoms.
9. Symmetry: ZPVE depends on the symmetry of the molecule.
10. Molecular geometry: ZPVE depends on the molecular geometry of the molecule.
11. Intermolecular forces: ZPVE depends on the intermolecular forces between molecules.
12. Electron configuration: ZPVE depends on the electron configuration of the atom.
13. Atomic number: ZPVE depends on the atomic number of the atom.
14. Atomic mass number: ZPVE depends on the mass number of the atom.
15. Atomic radius: ZPVE depends on the size of the atom.
16. Hybridization: ZPVE depends on the number and arrangement of atomic orbitals.
17. Electronegativity difference: ZPVE depends on the difference in electronegativity between two atoms.
18. Bond length: ZPVE depends on the bond length between two atoms.
19. Bond angle: ZPVE depends on the bond angle between two atoms.
20. Symmetry: ZPVE depends on the symmetry of the molecule.
