Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict toxicity activity of a molecule against the mitochondrial membrane potential in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate the hydrophobic index (HLB) of the molecule.
2. Determine the number of polar functional groups (FGs) in the molecule.
3. Count the number of aromatic rings in the molecule.
4. Estimate the number of hydrogen bonding interactions (HBIs) in the molecule.
5. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds in the molecule.
6. Calculate the number of amino acid residues in the molecule.
7. Estimate the number of cysteine residues in the molecule.
8. Calculate the number of methionine residues in the molecule.
9. Estimate the number of proline residues in the molecule.
10. Calculate the number of glycine residues in the molecule.
11. Estimate the number of asparagine residues in the molecule.
12. Calculate the number of serine residues in the molecule.
13. Estimate the number of tyrosine residues in the molecule.
14. Calculate the number of lysine residues in the molecule.
15. Estimate the number of histidine residues in the molecule.
16. Calculate the number of arginine residues in the molecule.
17. Estimate the number of cysteine residues in the molecule.
18. Calculate the number of methionine residues in the molecule.
19. Estimate the number of proline residues in the molecule.
20. Calculate the number of asparagine residues in the molecule.
