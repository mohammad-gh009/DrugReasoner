Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict toxicity activity of a molecule against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate the molecular weight of the molecule.
2. Identify the functional groups present in the molecule.
3. Determine the number of rotatable bonds.
4. Count the number of aromatic rings.
5. Estimate the number of hydrogen bonding interactions.
6. Identify the polar/nonpolar nature of the molecule.
7. Estimate the number of amino acid residues.
8. Identify the presence of acidic/basic functional groups.
9. Estimate the number of carbon-hydrogen bonds.
10. Identify the presence of functional group interactions.
11. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds in the functional group.
12. Identify the presence of aromatic rings.
13. Estimate the number of amino acid residues.
14. Identify the presence of polar/nonpolar functional groups.
15. Estimate the number of carbon-hydrogen bonds in the functional group.
16. Identify the presence of functional group interactions.
17. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds in the functional group.
18. Identify the presence of aromatic rings.
19. Estimate the number of amino acid residues.
20. Identify the presence of polar/nonpolar functional groups.
