Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict toxicity activity of a molecule against the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate the molecular weight of the molecule.
2. Identify the functional groups present in the molecule.
3. Determine the number of rotatable bonds in the molecule.
4. Count the number of aromatic rings in the molecule.
5. Estimate the polar surface area of the molecule.
6. Identify the number of hydrogen bonding interactions in the molecule.
7. Estimate the octamer symmetry of the molecule.
8. Calculate the number of hydrophobic interactions in the molecule.
9. Estimate the number of charged interactions in the molecule.
10. Identify the number of amino acid residues in the molecule.
11. Estimate the number of carbon-hydrogen bonds in the molecule.
12. Determine the number of rotatable bonds in the ligand.
13. Estimate the number of aromatic rings in the ligand.
14. Identify the number of hydrophobic interactions in the ligand.
15. Estimate the number of amino acid residues in the ligand.
16. Determine the number of carbon-hydrogen bonds in the ligand.
17. Identify the number of rotatable bonds in the ligand.
18. Estimate the number of aromatic rings in the ligand.
19. Identify the number of hydrophobic interactions in the ligand.
20. Estimate the number of amino acid residues in the ligand.
