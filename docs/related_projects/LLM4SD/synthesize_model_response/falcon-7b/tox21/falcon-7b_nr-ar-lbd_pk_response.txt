Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict toxicity activity of a molecule against the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate the molecular weight of the molecule.
2. Identify the functional groups present in the molecule.
3. Determine the number of rotatable bonds in the molecule.
4. Count the number of aromatic rings in the molecule.
5. Estimate the number of hydrogen bonding interactions in the molecule.
6. Identify the symmetry of the molecule.
7. Estimate the number of amino acid residues in the ligand-binding domain.
8. Identify the hydrophobic character of the molecule.
9. Estimate the number of polar amino acid residues in the ligand-binding domain.
10. Identify the presence of metal ions in the molecule.
11. Estimate the number of carbon-carbon single bonds in the molecule.
12. Identify the presence of halogens in the molecule.
13. Estimate the number of aromatic rings in the ligand-binding domain.
14. Identify the presence of nitrogenous bases in the ligand-binding domain.
15. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds in the ligand-binding domain.
16. Identify the presence of amino acid side chains in the ligand-binding domain.
17. Estimate the number of hydrophobic amino acid residues in the ligand-binding domain.
18. Identify the presence of cysteine residues in the ligand-binding domain.
19. Estimate the number of carbon-carbon double bonds in the ligand-binding domain.
20. Identify the presence of metal ions in the ligand-binding domain.
