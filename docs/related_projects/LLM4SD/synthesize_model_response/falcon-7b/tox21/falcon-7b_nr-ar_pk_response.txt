Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict toxicity activity of a molecule against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate the molecular weight of the molecule.
2. Identify the functional groups present in the molecule.
3. Determine the number of rotatable bonds.
4. Count the number of aromatic rings.
5. Estimate the number of hydrogen bonding interactions.
6. Identify the polar/nonpolar nature of the molecule.
7. Estimate the number of amino acid residues.
8. Identify the number of cysteine residues.
9. Estimate the number of tyrosine residues.
10. Identify the number of serine/threonine residues.
11. Estimate the number of aspartic acid residues.
12. Identify the number of lysine residues.
13. Estimate the number of histidine residues.
14. Identify the number of methionine residues.
15. Estimate the number of proline residues.
16. Identify the number of glycine residues.
17. Estimate the number of alanine residues.
18. Identify the number of asparagine residues.
19. Estimate the number of serine residues.
20. Identify the number of threonine residues.
