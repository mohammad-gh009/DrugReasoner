task name: tox21_sr-atad5
Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict toxicity activity of a molecule against the genotoxicity indicated by ATAD5 in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate the molecular weight of the molecule.
2. Identify the functional groups present in the molecule.
3. Determine the number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule.
4. Count the number of electronegative atoms in the molecule.
5. Estimate the number of polar bonds in the molecule.
6. Identify the number of aromatic rings in the molecule.
7. Estimate the number of amino acid residues in the molecule.
8. Identify the number of hydroxyl groups in the molecule.
9. Estimate the number of carbon atoms in the molecule.
10. Identify the number of double bonds in the molecule.
11. Estimate the number of amide bonds in the molecule.
12. Identify the number of carboxyl groups in the molecule.
13. Estimate the number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule.
14. Identify the number of oxygen atoms in the molecule.
