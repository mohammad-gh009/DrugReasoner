Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict toxicity activity of a molecule against the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate the molecular weight of the molecule.
2. Identify the functional groups present in the molecule.
3. Determine the number of rotatable bonds.
4. Count the number of hydrogen atoms.
5. Estimate the polar surface area of the molecule.
6. Identify the number of aromatic rings.
7. Estimate the number of amino acid residues.
8. Identify the presence of any reactive functional groups.
9. Estimate the number of carbon-hydrogen bonds.
10. Identify the number of oxygen atoms.
11. Estimate the number of nitrogen atoms.
12. Identify the presence of any halogens.
13. Estimate the number of double bonds.
14. Identify the number of sulfur atoms.
15. Estimate the number of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic rings.
16. Identify the number of carbon-containing heterocyclic rings.
17. Estimate the number of aromatic heterocyclic rings.
18. Identify the number of nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic rings.
19. Estimate the number of carbon atoms in the heterocyclic rings.
20. Identify the presence of any metal ions.
