Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict toxicity activity of a molecule against the heat shock factor response element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate the molecular weight of the molecule.
2. Identify the functional groups present in the molecule.
3. Determine the number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule.
4. Count the number of oxygen atoms in the molecule.
5. Identify the electronegativity values of the atoms in the molecule.
6. Check for the presence of polar bonds and atoms.
7. Look for halogens and nitrogen atoms.
8. Check for the presence of aromatic rings.
9. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds in the molecule.
10. Identify the number of carbon atoms in the molecule.
11. Estimate the number of double bonds in the molecule.
12. Identify the number of sulfur atoms in the molecule.
13. Determine the number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule.
14. Identify the number of chlorine atoms in the molecule.
15. Estimate the number of oxygen atoms in the molecule.
16. Identify the number of phosphorus atoms in the molecule.
17. Estimate the number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule.
18. Identify the number of sulfur atoms in the molecule.
