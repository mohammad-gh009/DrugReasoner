Response from model: 
Assume you are an experienced chemist. please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict Cv, the heat capacity at constant volume of a molecule. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules without access to 3D information. and should be short (no more than 15 words). Each rule needs to be very specific. please start with 'The list of rules are....'.
1. Every molecule has a unique arrangement of atoms.
2. The number of valence electrons determines the chemical properties of an element.
3. Electronegativity is the tendency of an atom to attract electrons towards itself.
4. The atomic mass of an element is the mass of its nucleus.
5. The atomic radius is the distance between the nucleus and the farthest valence electron.
6. The electronegativity difference between adjacent elements in a period is constant.
7. The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in its nucleus.
8. The atomic number of hydrogen is 1, and its atomic mass is 1.008.
9. The atomic number of helium is 2, and its atomic mass is 4.002.
10. The atomic number of lithium is 3, and its atomic mass is 6.941.
11. The atomic number of beryllium is 4, and its atomic mass is 9.012.
12. The atomic number of boron is 5, and its atomic mass is 11.008.
13. The atomic number of carbon is 6, and its atomic mass is 12.011.
14. The atomic number of oxygen is 8, and its atomic mass is 15.999.
15. The atomic number of nitrogen is 7, and its atomic mass is 14.007.
16. The atomic number of oxygen is 8, and its atomic mass is 15.999.
17. The atomic number of sulfur is 8, and its atomic mass is 15.999.
18. The atomic number of chlorine is 7, and its atomic mass is 17.007.
19. The atomic number of argon is 18, and its atomic mass is 39.948.
20. The atomic number of krypton is 36, and its atomic mass is 39.948.
