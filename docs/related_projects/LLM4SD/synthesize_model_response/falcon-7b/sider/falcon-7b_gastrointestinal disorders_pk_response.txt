task name: sider_gastrointestinal disorders
Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict the toxicity activity of a molecule in causing gastrointestinal disorders. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate log P (Octanol/Water partition coefficient) to estimate oral absorption.
2. Estimate TPSA (Thiol Peroxide Strength, a measure of electrophilic character) for predicting gastrointestinal toxicity.
3. Consider molecular weight, polar/nonpolar nature, and degree of branching for toxicity.
4. Assess aromaticity and electron-withdrawing/donating effects.
5. Estimate hydrogen bonding ability and hydrophobicity.
6. Account for rotational and steric hindrance.
7. Don't forget about counterions and charge interactions.
8. Assess aromatic ring strain and its effect on toxicity.
9. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds.
10. Consider the presence of functional groups and their impact on toxicity.
11. Estimate the number of hydrogen bonding sites.
12. Assess the presence of halogens and their effect on toxicity.
13. Don't forget about lipophilic/hydrophobic balance.
14. Estimate the number of polar/nonpolar bonds.
15. Assess the electronegativity difference between atoms.
16. Estimate the number of chiral centers.
17. Assess the symmetry of the molecule.
18. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds.
19. Consider the presence of functional groups and their impact on toxicity.
20. Assess the presence of halogens and their effect on toxicity.
