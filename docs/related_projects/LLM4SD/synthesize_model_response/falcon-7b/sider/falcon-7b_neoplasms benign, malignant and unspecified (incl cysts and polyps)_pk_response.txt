task name: sider_neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps)
Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict the toxicity activity of a molecule in causing neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate the molecular weight of the molecule.
2. Identify the functional groups present in the molecule.
3. Count the number of hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms.
4. Determine the electronegativity values of the atoms in the molecule.
5. Estimate the polar/nonpolar nature of the molecule.
6. Identify the number of rotatable bonds in the molecule.
7. Estimate the number of double bonds in the molecule.
8. Identify the number of aromatic rings in the molecule.
9. Estimate the number of alkyl groups in the molecule.
10. Identify the number of amino acid residues in the molecule.
11. Estimate the number of carbohydrate groups in the molecule.
12. Identify the number of phosphate groups in the molecule.
13. Estimate the number of amide groups in the molecule.
14. Identify the number of carbon-carbon single bonds in the molecule.
15. Estimate the number of nitrogen-nitrogen single bonds in the molecule.
16. Identify the number of sulfur-sulfur single bonds in the molecule.
17. Estimate the number of chlorine-chlorine single bonds in the molecule.
18. Identify the number of fluorine-fluorine single bonds in the molecule.
19. Estimate the number of oxygen-oxygen single bonds in the molecule.
20. Identify the number of nitrogen-nitrogen double bonds in the molecule.
