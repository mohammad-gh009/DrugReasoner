task name: sider_product issues
Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict the toxicity activity of a molecule in causing product issues. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate log P (Octanol/Water partition coefficient)
2. Estimate molecular weight by using empirical formula
3. Check for polar bonds and groups
4. Count the number of rotatable bonds
5. Estimate the number of hydrogen bonding sites
6. Consider electronegativity differences between atoms
7. Assess aromaticity
8. Estimate the number of functional groups
9. Check for halogenation
10. Estimate the number of chiral centers
11. Assess symmetry
12. Estimate the electron density on atoms
13. Consider the electronegativity difference between atoms
14. Estimate the number of polar bonds
15. Count the number of non-bonded pairs of electrons
16. Assess the symmetry of the molecule
17. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds
18. Count the number of hydrogen bonding sites
19. Estimate the number of functional groups
20. Assess the symmetry of the molecule.
