task name: sider_hepatobiliary disorders
Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict the toxicity activity of a molecule in causing hepatobiliary disorders. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate log P (Octanol/Water partition coefficient) to estimate the molecule's polarity.
2. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds using the formula n = (2 x (n-1)/3).
3. Count the number of polar functional groups (O, N, S, etc.) and estimate their contribution to the molecule's polarity.
4. Estimate the number of hydrogen bonding sites using the formula H = (n x (n-1)/2)/2.
5. Estimate the number of aromatic rings and the length of the longest chain.
6. Count the number of carbon atoms in the molecule and estimate the contribution of each carbon atom to the molecule's polarity.
7. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds between carbon atoms.
8. Estimate the number of oxygen atoms in the molecule.
9. Count the number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule and estimate the contribution of each nitrogen atom to the molecule's polarity.
10. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds between nitrogen and carbon atoms.
11. Count the number of sulfur atoms in the molecule and estimate the contribution of each sulfur atom to the molecule's polarity.
12. Estimate the number of chlorine atoms in the molecule.
13. Count the number of fluorine atoms in the molecule and estimate the contribution of each fluorine atom to the molecule's polarity.
14. Estimate the number of carbon-hydrogen bonds in the molecule.
15. Count the number of nitrogen-hydrogen bonds in the molecule.
16. Estimate the number of oxygen-hydrogen bonds in the molecule.
17. Count the number of sulfur-hydrogen bonds in the molecule.
18. Estimate the number of chlorine-hydrogen bonds in the molecule.
19. Count the number of nitrogen-carbon-hydrogen bonds in the molecule.
20. Estimate the number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule.
