task name: sider_social circumstances
Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict the toxicity activity of a molecule in causing social circumstances. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate atomic mass: Determine the number of protons and neutrons in the molecule.
2. Electronegativity: Assign a value to each atom in the molecule based on its electronegativity.
3. Bond length: Predict the bond length between two atoms in the molecule.
4. Bond angle: Predict the bond angle between two atoms in the molecule.
5. Hybridization: Assign a hybridization to each atom in the molecule based on its hybridization type.
6. Molecular geometry: Determine the shape of the molecule based on the number of bonding pairs.
7. Polar/nonpolar: Assign a polarity to each atom in the molecule based on its electronegativity.
8. Hydrogen bonding: Predict the presence and strength of hydrogen bonding between atoms in the molecule.
9. Electron density: Assign an electron density value to each atom in the molecule.
10. Resonance energy: Calculate the resonance energy of the molecule based on the number of bonding pairs.
11. Nucleus shielding effect: Calculate the shielding effect of the nucleus on the electronic structure of the molecule.
12. Local symmetry: Assign a local symmetry to each atom in the molecule.
13. Electronic structure: Assign an electronic structure to each atom in the molecule.
14. Mass spectrometry: Determine the mass of the molecule based on the number of isotopes.
15. Infrared spectroscopy: Assign an infrared spectrum to each atom in the molecule.
16. Mass-charge ratio: Assign a mass-charge ratio to each atom in the molecule.
17. X-ray diffraction: Determine the crystal structure of the molecule based on the number of bonding pairs.
18. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR): Assign an NMR spectrum to each atom in the molecule.
19. Chemical reactivity: Assign a chemical reactivity to each atom in the molecule.
20. Electronegativity difference: Calculate the difference in electronegativity between two atoms in the molecule.
