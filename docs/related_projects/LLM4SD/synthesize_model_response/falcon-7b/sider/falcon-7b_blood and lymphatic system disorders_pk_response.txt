task name: sider_blood and lymphatic system disorders
Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict the toxicity activity of a molecule in causing blood and lymphatic system disorders. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate log P (Octanol/Water partition coefficient) to estimate blood-brain barrier permeability.
2. Estimate octanol-water partition coefficient (log P) for nonpolar molecules.
3. Estimate water solubility (log S) for polar molecules.
4. Calculate molecular weight (MW) of a molecule.
5. Estimate octanol-water partition coefficient (log O/W) for polar molecules.
6. Estimate octanol-water partition coefficient (log O/W) for nonpolar molecules.
7. Estimate water solubility (log S) for polar molecules.
8. Estimate octanol-water partition coefficient (log O/W) for nonpolar molecules.
