task name: sider_eye disorders
Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict the toxicity activity of a molecule in causing eye disorders. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate log P (Octanol/Water partition coefficient) to estimate the polar/nonpolar nature of the molecule.
2. Estimate the number of hydrogen atoms by using the formula: (# of H atoms) = (n x 2.5), where n is the number of carbon atoms.
3. Estimate the number of oxygen atoms by using the formula: (# of O atoms) = (n x 2.5), where n is the number of carbon atoms.
4. Estimate the number of nitrogen atoms by using the formula: (# of N atoms) = (n x 2.5), where n is the number of carbon atoms.
5. Estimate the number of chlorine atoms by using the formula: (# of Cl atoms) = (n x 2.5), where n is the number of carbon atoms.
6. Estimate the number of fluorine atoms by using the formula: (# of F atoms) = (n x 2.5), where n is the number of carbon atoms.
7. Estimate the number of sulfur atoms by using the formula: (# of S atoms) = (n x 2.5), where n is the number of carbon atoms.
8. Estimate the number of nitrogen-containing functional groups by using the formula: (# of N-containing functional groups) = (n x 2.5), where n is the number of carbon atoms.
9. Estimate the number of oxygen-containing functional groups by using the formula: (# of O-containing functional groups) = (n x 2.5), where n is the number of carbon atoms.
