task name: sider_general disorders and administration site conditions
Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict the toxicity activity of a molecule in causing general disorders and administration site conditions. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate log P (Octanol/Water partition coefficient) to estimate the molecule's polarity.
2. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds using the formula n = (2 x (n-1)/3).
3. Estimate the number of hydrogen atoms using the formula n = (n-1)/2.
4. Estimate the number of carbon atoms using the formula n = (n-1)/2.
5. Estimate the number of oxygen atoms using the formula n = (n-1)/2.
6. Estimate the number of nitrogen atoms using the formula n = (n-1)/2.
7. Estimate the number of sulfur atoms using the formula n = (n-1)/2.
8. Estimate the number of chlorine atoms using the formula n = (n-1)/2.
9. Estimate the number of fluorine atoms using the formula n = (n-1)/2.
10. Estimate the number of iodine atoms using the formula n = (n-1)/2.
11. Estimate the number of nitrogen-containing functional groups using the formula n = (n-1)/2.
12. Estimate the number of oxygen-containing functional groups using the formula n = (n-1)/2.
13. Estimate the number of carbon-containing functional groups using the formula n = (n-1)/2.
14. Estimate the number of nitrogen-containing heteroatoms using the formula n = (n-1)/2.
15. Estimate the number of oxygen-containing heteroatoms using the formula n = (n-1)/2.
16. Estimate the number of sulfur-containing heteroatoms using the formula n = (n-1)/2.
17. Estimate the number of chlorine-containing heteroatoms using the formula n = (n-1)/2.
18. Estimate the number of iodine-containing heteroatoms using the formula n = (n-1)/2.
19. Estimate the number of nitrogen-containing functional groups using the formula n = (n-1)/2.
20. Estimate the number of oxygen-containing functional groups using the formula n = (n-1)/2.
