task name: sider_endocrine disorders
Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict the toxicity activity of a molecule in causing endocrine disorders. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate log P (Octanol/Water partition coefficient) to estimate the molecule's size and polarity.
2. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds using the formula (n = 2(n-1)/(n-2)).
3. Count the number of aromatic rings and alkyl chains.
4. Estimate the number of hydrogen atoms using the formula (n = (n-1)/2).
5. Calculate the molecular weight by adding the atomic masses of all atoms in the molecule.
6. Estimate the number of polar and nonpolar atoms using the formulas (n = (n-1)/2 and n = (n-1)/2+1, respectively).
7. Count the number of functional groups (e.g., halogens, carbonyl, etc.).
8. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds using the formula (n = 2(n-1)/(n-2)).
9. Count the number of chiral centers (mirror symmetry axes).
10. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds using the formula (n = 2(n-1)/(n-2)).
11. Count the number of alkyl chains.
12. Estimate the number of aromatic rings.
13. Count the number of functional groups (e.g., halogens, carbonyl, etc.).
14. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds using the formula (n = 2(n-1)/(n-2)).
15. Count the number of chiral centers (mirror symmetry axes).
16. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds using the formula (n = 2(n-1)/(n-2)).
17. Count the number of functional groups (e.g., halogens, carbonyl, etc.).
18. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds using the formula (n = 2(n-1)/(n-2)).
19. Count the number of chiral centers (mirror symmetry axes).
20. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds using the formula (n = 2(n-1)/(n-2)).
