task name: sider_investigations
Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict the toxicity activity of a molecule in causing investigations. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate atomic mass: Determine the number of protons and neutrons in the molecule.
2. Count the number of valence electrons: Add up the number of electrons in the outermost shell and any inner shells.
3. Identify electronegativity values: Assign relative values to atoms based on their ability to attract electrons.
4. Consider molecular geometry: Classify the molecule as a polar or nonpolar compound.
5. Determine bond lengths and angles: Compare the length and angle of each bond in the molecule to its corresponding reference value.
6. Identify functional groups: Recognize common functional groups and their effects on the molecule.
7. Calculate bond energies: Use the formula Î”G = -S(n(n+2)/2) to estimate the bond energy between two atoms.
8. Identify electronegativity differences: Assign relative values to atoms based on their electronegativity differences.
9. Calculate hybridization: Assign hybridization symbols to atoms based on their hybridization state.
10. Identify aromaticity: Determine the presence of aromatic rings in the molecule.
11. Count the number of rotational isomers: Identify the number of possible rotational isomers.
12. Calculate formal charge: Assign a value to each atom based on its formal charge.
13. Identify resonance structures: Determine the most stable and common resonance structures for the molecule.
14. Calculate the number of polar bonds: Assign polar bond values to atoms based on their electronegativity difference.
15. Identify the most stable conformation: Assign the most stable conformation of the molecule.
16. Calculate the number of nonbonded electrons: Add up the number of nonbonded electrons in the molecule.
17. Identify the most stable electronic configuration: Assign the most stable electronic configuration of the molecule.
18. Calculate the number of valence electrons: Add up the number of valence electrons in the molecule.
19. Identify the most stable conformational arrangement: Assign the most stable conformational arrangement of the molecule.
20. Calculate the number of rotational isomers: Identify the number of rotational isomers for the molecule.
