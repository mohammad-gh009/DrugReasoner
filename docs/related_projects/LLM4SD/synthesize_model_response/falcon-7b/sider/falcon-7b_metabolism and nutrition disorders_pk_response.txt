task name: sider_metabolism and nutrition disorders
Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict the toxicity activity of a molecule in causing metabolism and nutrition disorders. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate log P (Octanol/Water partition coefficient) to estimate oral absorption. 2. Estimate half-life in vivo using animal model. 3. Calculate molecular weight for drug discovery. 4. Estimate intrinsic clearance in vitro using animal model. 5. Calculate octanol/water partition coefficient for lipophilic drugs. 6. Estimate blood-brain barrier permeability using animal model. 7. Calculate protein binding using animal model. 8. Estimate metabolic stability in vitro using animal model. 9. Calculate in vivo half-life using animal model. 10. Estimate intrinsic clearance in vitro using animal model. 11. Calculate octanol/water partition coefficient for polar drugs. 12. Estimate tissue distribution using animal model. 13. Calculate in vivo half-life using animal model. 14. Estimate intrinsic clearance in vitro using animal model. 15. Calculate octanol/water partition coefficient for non-polar drugs. 16. Estimate in vivo half-life using animal model. 17. Calculate in vitro protein binding using animal model. 18. Estimate in vivo half-life using animal model. 19. Calculate in vitro protein binding using animal model. 20. Estimate in vivo half-life using animal model.
