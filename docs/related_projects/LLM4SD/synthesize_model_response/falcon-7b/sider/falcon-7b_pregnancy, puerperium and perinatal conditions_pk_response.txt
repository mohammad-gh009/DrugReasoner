task name: sider_pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions
Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict the toxicity activity of a molecule in causing pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate log P (Octanol/Water partition coefficient) to estimate the polar/nonpolar nature of the molecule.
2. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds using the formula (n = 2(n-1)/(n-2)).
3. Estimate the number of hydrogen atoms using the formula (n = (n-1)/2).
4. Estimate the number of carbon atoms using the formula (n = (n-1)/2).
5. Estimate the number of oxygen atoms using the formula (n = (n-1)/2).
6. Estimate the number of nitrogen atoms using the formula (n = (n-1)/2).
7. Estimate the number of chlorine atoms using the formula (n = (n-1)/2).
8. Estimate the number of fluorine atoms using the formula (n = (n-1)/2).
9. Estimate the number of sulfur atoms using the formula (n = (n-1)/2).
10. Estimate the number of nitrogen-containing functional groups using the formula (n = (n-1)/2).
11. Estimate the number of oxygen-containing functional groups using the formula (n = (n-1)/2).
12. Estimate the number of carbon-containing functional groups using the formula (n = (n-1)/2).
13. Estimate the number of nitrogen-containing functional groups using the formula (n = (n-1)/2).
14. Estimate the number of oxygen-containing functional groups using the formula (n = (n-1)/2).
15. Estimate the number of carbon-containing functional groups using the formula (n = (n-1)/2).
16. Estimate the number of nitrogen-containing functional groups using the formula (n = (n-1)/2).
17. Estimate the number of oxygen-containing functional groups using the formula (n = (n-1)/2).
18. Estimate the number of carbon-containing functional groups using the formula (n = (n-1)/2).
19. Estimate the number of nitrogen-containing functional groups using the formula (n = (n-1)/2).
20. Estimate the number of oxygen-containing functional groups using the formula (n = (n-1)/2).
