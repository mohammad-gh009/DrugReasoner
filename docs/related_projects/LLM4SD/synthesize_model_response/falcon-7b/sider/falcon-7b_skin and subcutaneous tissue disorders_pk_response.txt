task name: sider_skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders
Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict the toxicity activity of a molecule in causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate log P (Octanol/Water partition coefficient) to estimate the polar/nonpolar nature of the molecule.
2. Estimate the number of hydrogen atoms by summing the atomic masses of all hydrogen atoms in the molecule.
3. Count the number of electronegative elements (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, chlorine, etc.) in the molecule.
4. Estimate the number of carbon atoms by summing the atomic masses of all carbon atoms in the molecule.
5. Count the number of aromatic rings in the molecule.
6. Estimate the number of amino acid residues in the molecule.
7. Count the number of hydroxyl groups in the molecule.
8. Estimate the number of double bonds in the molecule.
9. Count the number of functional groups in the molecule.
10. Estimate the number of polar/nonpolar bonds in the molecule.
11. Count the number of rotatable bonds in the molecule.
12. Estimate the number of polar/nonpolar atoms in the molecule.
13. Count the number of alkyl groups in the molecule.
14. Estimate the number of aromatic rings in the molecule.
15. Count the number of amino acid residues in the molecule.
16. Estimate the number of functional groups in the molecule.
17. Count the number of carbon atoms in the molecule.
18. Estimate the number of oxygen atoms in the molecule.
19. Count the number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule.
20. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds in the molecule.
