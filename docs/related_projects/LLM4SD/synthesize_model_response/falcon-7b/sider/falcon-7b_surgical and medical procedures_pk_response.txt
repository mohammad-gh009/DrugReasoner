task name: sider_surgical and medical procedures
Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict the toxicity activity of a molecule in causing surgical and medical procedures. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate atomic mass: Determine the number of protons and neutrons in the molecule.
2. Electronegativity: Assign a value to each atom in the molecule based on its electronegativity.
3. Bond length: Predict the average bond length between atoms in the molecule.
4. Bond angle: Predict the average bond angle between atoms in the molecule.
5. Hydrogen bonding: Calculate the strength of hydrogen bonding between atoms in the molecule.
6. Polar/nonpolar: Assign a value to each atom in the molecule based on its polarity.
7. Electronic structure: Assign an electron configuration to each atom in the molecule.
8. Hybridization: Assign a hybridization to each atom in the molecule.
9. Resonance energy: Calculate the resonance energy of the molecule.
10. Lone pair electrons: Assign a value to each atom in the molecule based on the number of lone pair electrons.
11. Electronegativity difference: Calculate the difference in electronegativity between adjacent atoms in the molecule.
12. Formal charge: Assign a value to each atom in the molecule based on its formal charge.
13. Lewis structure: Assign a structure to the molecule using the valence electrons.
14. VSEPR theory: Assign a spatial arrangement to the molecule based on the VSEPR theory.
15. Molecular geometry: Assign a molecular geometry to the molecule based on the number of bonding pairs.
16. Intermolecular forces: Assign intermolecular forces between molecules in the molecule.
17. Symmetry: Assign symmetry to the molecule based on the number of symmetry axes.
18. Packing density: Calculate the packing density of the molecule based on the number of atoms in the molecule.
19. Molecular weight: Assign a molecular weight to the molecule based on the number of atoms in the molecule.
20. NMR shielding constants: Assign NMR shielding constants to the molecule based on the number of shielding constants.
