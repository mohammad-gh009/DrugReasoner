task name: sider_immune system disorders
Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict the toxicity activity of a molecule in causing immune system disorders. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate log P (Octanol/Water) to estimate partitioning into tissues.
2. Estimate octanol-water partition coefficient (log P).
3. Calculate molecular weight (MW) of the molecule.
4. Estimate the number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule.
5. Estimate the number of oxygen atoms in the molecule.
6. Estimate the number of carbon atoms in the molecule.
7. Estimate the number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule.
8. Estimate the number of chlorine atoms in the molecule.
9. Estimate the number of fluorine atoms in the molecule.
10. Estimate the number of sulfur atoms in the molecule.
11. Estimate the number of nitrogen-carbon bonds in the molecule.
12. Estimate the number of oxygen-carbon bonds in the molecule.
13. Estimate the number of nitrogen-oxygen bonds in the molecule.
14. Estimate the number of oxygen-oxygen bonds in the molecule.
15. Estimate the number of carbon-carbon bonds in the molecule.
16. Estimate the number of oxygen-carbon bonds in the molecule.
17. Estimate the number of nitrogen-nitrogen bonds in the molecule.
18. Estimate the number of oxygen-nitrogen bonds in the molecule.
19. Estimate the number of nitrogen-nitrogen bonds in the molecule.
20. Estimate the number of oxygen-oxygen bonds in the molecule.
