task name: sider_cardiac disorders
Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict the toxicity activity of a molecule in causing cardiac disorders. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate the molecular weight of the molecule.
2. Identify the functional groups present in the molecule.
3. Count the number of hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms.
4. Determine the electronegativity values of atoms in the molecule.
5. Check for the presence of double bonds and aromatic rings.
6. Consider the symmetry of the molecule.
7. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds.
8. Identify the central atom in the molecule.
9. Estimate the number of polar and nonpolar atoms.
10. Look for halogens and metals in the molecule.
11. Assess the electron density of the molecule.
12. Consider the molecular geometry of the molecule.
13. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds and/or functional groups.
14. Identify the most electronegative atom in the molecule.
15. Estimate the number of non-bonded pairs of electrons.
16. Look for the presence of chiral centers in the molecule.
17. Determine the symmetry of the molecule.
18. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds and/or functional groups.
19. Identify the most electronegative atom in the molecule.
20. Estimate the number of non-bonded pairs of electrons.
