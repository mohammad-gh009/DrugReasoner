task name: sider_vascular disorders
Response from model: 
Assumed you are an experienced chemist. Please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict the toxicity activity of a molecule in causing vascular disorders. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules. Each rule starts with 'Calculate....' and don't explain, be short and within 20 words.
1. Calculate the molecular weight of the molecule.
2. Identify the functional groups present in the molecule.
3. Count the number of hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms.
4. Determine the electronegativity values of atoms in the molecule.
5. Check for the presence of double bonds and aromatic rings.
6. Consider the symmetry of the molecule.
7. Estimate the polar/nonpolar nature of the molecule.
8. Identify the number of rotatable bonds in the molecule.
9. Estimate the octet rule compliance of the molecule.
10. Look for the presence of halogens and metals in the molecule.
11. Assess the electron density of the molecule.
12. Consider the molecular geometry of the molecule.
13. Estimate the number of acidic/basic functional groups in the molecule.
14. Identify the presence of functional groups in proximity to the active site.
15. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds in the molecule.
16. Assess the symmetry of the molecule.
17. Estimate the number of polar/nonpolar functional groups in the molecule.
18. Identify the presence of functional groups in proximity to the active site.
19. Estimate the number of rotatable bonds in the molecule.
20. Assess the symmetry of the molecule.
