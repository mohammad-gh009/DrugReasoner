task name: R^2
Response from model: 
Assume you are an experienced chemist. please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict electronic spatial extent (R2) of a molecule. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules without access to 3D information. and should be short (no more than 15 words). Each rule needs to be very specific. please start with 'The list of rules are....'.
1. Electronegativity difference between atoms in a molecule should be less than 0.4.
2. The electronegativity difference between two adjacent atoms in a molecule should be greater than 0.4.
3. The electronegativity difference between two non-adjacent atoms in a molecule should be less than 0.8.
4. The electronegativity difference between a carbon atom and an oxygen atom in a molecule should be greater than 0.4.
5. The electronegativity difference between two carbon atoms in a molecule should be less than 0.8.
6. The electronegativity difference between two oxygen atoms in a molecule should be greater than 0.4.
7. The electronegativity difference between two hydrogen atoms in a molecule should be less than 0.4.
8. The electronegativity difference between two nitrogen atoms in a molecule should be greater than 0.4.
9. The electronegativity difference between two sulfur atoms in a molecule should be less than 0.4.
10. The electronegativity difference between two chlorine atoms in a molecule should be greater than 0.4.
11. The electronegativity difference between two fluorine atoms in a molecule should be less than 0.4.
