task name: G
Response from model: 
Assume you are an experienced chemist. please come up with 20 rules that you think are very important to predict G, Gibbs free energy of the molecule at a specific temperature, specifically 298.15 Kelvin (approximately room temperature) of a molecule. Each rule is either about the structure or property of molecules without access to 3D information. and should be short (no more than 15 words). Each rule needs to be very specific. please start with 'The list of rules are....'.
1. Every molecule has a unique composition of atoms.
2. Atoms are the building blocks of molecules.
3. The number of atoms in a molecule determines its size and shape.
4. The arrangement of atoms in a molecule affects its properties.
5. The distance between atoms in a molecule affects its polarity.
6. The electronegativity difference between atoms in a molecule affects its reactivity.
7. The symmetry of a molecule affects its polarity and reactivity.
8. The hybridization of atoms in a molecule affects its polarity and reactivity.
