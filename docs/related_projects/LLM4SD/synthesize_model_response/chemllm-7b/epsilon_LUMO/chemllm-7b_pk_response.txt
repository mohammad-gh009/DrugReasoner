task name: epsilon_LUMO
Response from model: 
1: Larger atoms generally have lower energies.
2 &ndash; Electron-donating groups increase electron density, lowering HOMOs but raising their corresponding orbitals' occupancy
4 : The numbering order on aromatic rings affects orbiteral occupation patterns 
5 - Aromatics typically exhibit higher stability due in part by delocalization effects reducing electronic repulsion between electrons within ring system(s)
6- Conjugated systems can stabilize pi-orbitls through resonance/deloclazation mechanisms resulting from overlap among adjacent pzorbits,
7-Large electronegative substituents will pull e&mdahv;s away form nuclei increasing local charge densities which could affect molecular properties including those related t oorbitorial occupations/energetics  
8-Hydrogens attached directly at carbon atom increases steric hindrance around nucleus thus affecting its ability attract surrounding valence shell's elecrons thereby influencing MOs eneretics as well   
9-Metallic elements tend toward having low ionisation potential values making them good candidates for donating/electrifying moieties    
10-Carbon-heteroatom bonds such amides/amines often contribute significantly towards polarizability leading into increased dipole moments across these types bonded species     
11-Nitrogen containing heterotropic compounds usually possess high acidity levels owing largely because they readily accept protons via lone pair donation onto nitrogen center        
12-Chirality plays role determining how much one enantiomer vs other exhibits greater reactivity based upon differences seen amongst both spatial arrangement along optical axis coupled wth relative orientations    of all possible stereoisomers present      
13-Polar solvents favor interactions involving dipoles whereas nonpolaar ones prefer van der Waas forces so polarity influences chemical reactions occurring under various conditions       
14-Acidic environments promote deprotonaion processes while basic solutions encourage protination events hence pH value determines reaction outcome depending what type reactants used         
16-Stereochemistry dictates whether certain organic transformations occur smoothly versus not given two identical substrutes only differin gby stereochemisry may undergo different fuctual pathways during synthesis process     

17-Tauterism occurs when there exists multiple ways where same compound might exist yet still retain similar chemistry characteristics even if structural arrangements vary slightly  

18-Proximity matters! Molecules exhibiting close proximity likely engage each othersâ€™ unpaired electons forming covalent/bond-like interaction known commonly referredly called hydrogen bridging complexes   

19-Density functional theory calculations provide accurate predictions regarding lowest occupied molcular Orbiolical Energies(Lumos), especially useful predicting ground state structures   and/or transition states associated therewith
