task name: c_v
Response from model: 
1) The number & type(s)-of bonds in molecular species determine their CV.
2 ) Molecules containing multiple hydrogen atoms have higher cvs due
to vibrational modes from these H-H interactions 
4-5: Molecular symmetry plays crucial role; lower symmetries lead t ohigher Cvs as they possess additional normal mode types  
6): Polarizability increases linearly w/ increasing electron density around nuclei   
7 ): Higher electronegativity differences between bonded atom leads towards greater polarization    
8 : Greater mass difference among two elements within covalent pairs results into larger dipole moment     
9 :) Smaller size means less energy required for rotation thus lesser entropy change during heating process      
10:) More complex structures generally exhibit broader spectrum leading toward increased entropies        
11+: Numbering scheme affects calculated values but does not alter relative order based on structural properties       
12+13:- Functional groups play significant roles by affecting both electronic effects alongwith steric hindrance factors         
14):- Temperature dependent phase transitions can significantly affect measured value so care must b taken while predicting it
