task name: U_0
Response from model: 
1: The lower molecular weight, generally means higher boiling point.
2 Rule for predicting solubility in water; polar substances dissolve well while nonpolar do not
4 If two atoms share three pairs bonds then it’s called sp² hybridization 
5 Aromatic rings have alternating single & double covalent bonding resulting from planar geometry around ring system  
6 Alkyl groups increase reactivity by inducing electron repulsion on adjacent carbons due their bulky nature   
7 Electron withdrawing substituents decrease acidity whereas electronegative ones increases basic strength    
8 Resonance structures contribute equally but only one exists as actual form during reaction process     
9 Carbocation stability depends upon number/position/distance between alkene group(s)/alkane chain/supstituent atom/group      
10 Steric hindrance reduces nucleophilicity because large steric bulk hinders attack via lone pair electrons        
11 Hydrogen-bonded complexes typically exhibit high melting points compared those lacking hydrogen bridges       
12 Ionic compounds usually melt above liquid ammonia temperatures (~-78°C), except if they contain fluorine which lowers this limit significantly         
13 Polarizability determines how much light waves can bend within material thereby affecting refractive index value          
14 Dipole-diploe interactions occur when there's partial charge separation across different parts leading attraction forces            
16 Boiling-point elevation occurs whenever dissolved substance has greater m.wt., thus increasing intermolecular attractions among particles           
17 Vapor pressure decreases exponentially based off molality concentration levels since vapor phase becomes saturated sooner                
18 Molecules containing multiple functionalities often undergo reactions involving all available sites simultaneously              
19 Substitutional halogenation results into formation new C-H sigma/bonds along side existing pi-orbitals causing aromatized intermediates               
21 Radical species tend towards forming stable products through anti-aromatic resonance stabilizations
