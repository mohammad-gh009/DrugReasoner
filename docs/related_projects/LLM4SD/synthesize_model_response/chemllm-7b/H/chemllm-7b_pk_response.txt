task name: H
Response from model: 
1: The numbering scheme for atoms in organic compounds.
2 Rule on how many valence electrons each atom has
4 Rules based upon electronegativity differences between two elements 
5 Amino acid side chain properties determine their reactivity patterns within proteins  
6 Bond length increases as bond order decreases; shorter bonds = stronger interactions   
7 Hydrogen-bonded structures typically have lower boiling points compared non-hydrobogenated ones    
8 Molecular geometry determines electron pair repulsion around central nuclei     
9 Steric hindrance can prevent certain reactions from occurring due its steric effects      
10 Electron-donating groups increase basicity while withdrawing group decrease it        
11 Residual polarities cause dipole moments even if thereâ€™s no net charge present       
12 Ionic strength affects solubility by disruptin hydrogen/bonds & electrostatic forces         
13 Solvation energy depends largely dependent molecular polarity/size            
14 Boiling point elevation occurs when adding salt/solutes into water solutions          
16 Molecules containing multiple functional grous often undergo complex reaction mechanisms           
17 Carbohydrates' stereochemistry plays crucial role determining biological activity              
18 Lipid bilayers form because hydrophobic tails attract one another but not against watery environment               
19 Enzyme catalysis involves lowering activation energies via induced fit mechanism                
21 pH levels affect enzyme function through protonation/deprotnaton states
