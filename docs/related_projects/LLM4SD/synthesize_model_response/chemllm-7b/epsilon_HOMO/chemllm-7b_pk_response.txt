task name: epsilon_HOMO
Response from model: 
1: The electronegativity difference between two atoms determines H-bonding strength.
2 Rule for predicting aromaticity based on ring current effect
4-5 electron count in conjugated systems, especially at least one heteroatom present 
6 Electron withdrawing groups increase negative charge density around nitrogen atom(s)
7 Resonance structures contribute equally unless thereâ€™s steric hindrance/steric strain involved  
8 Presence & position influence nucleophilicity; e.g., alkyl substituents decrease it while halogens do not affect much   
9 Inductive effects due mainly by C-C bonds but also possible from N-H/C=S etc bond types    
10 Hyperconjugation occurs when adjacent p orbitals overlap via sigma electrons     
11 Conjunction increases stability as well reduces reactivity towards electrophiles        
12 Alkynes have higher boiling points compared their corresponding alkenedues because they can form hydrogen bridges      
13 Carbocation stabilization depends upon number/distance/separation/electrnegtivity differences among surrounding carbons       
14 Aromatics generally exhibit lower acidities/basic strengths since all pi-electrons delocalized across whole rings rather localized within individual benzene-like units         
16 Nitrogen lone pairs act like Lewis bases whereas oxygen ones behave similarly except water where both O-N-O angles close together making them stronger acids  

17 Metal complex formation enhances oxidative reactions through metallophillic interactions which lead into further destabilizing species being formed during reaction process itself!          
18 In general terms polarizability decreases down group so heavier elements will show less ability toward forming strong dipole-diploe interaction forces thereby reducing solubility capacity too!
19 Stereoeffect controls regioselectivities along certain pathways depending how many available anti-aromatic regions exist alongside reactant substrates themselves!!
