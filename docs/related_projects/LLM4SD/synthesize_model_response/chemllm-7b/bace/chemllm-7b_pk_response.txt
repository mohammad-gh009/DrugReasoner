Response from model: 
I'm sorry but as AI language model I do not have personal experiences or beliefs; however here's what could help: 

To determine whether BACe -inhibiting activity of molecules would require extensive computational modeling techniques such molecular docking simulations which involve complex mathematical calculations based on various parameters including chemical properties (such lipophilicity) structural features like shape complementarity between enzyme-inactive site & ligand etc., thermodynamic stability index values for both binding partners alongwith their solubility profiles in water/organic media.
