task name: sider_skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders
Response from model: 
1) Calculate molecular weight.
2 ) Check for presence/absence
3). Determine lipophilicity (logP).
4 ). Evaluate solubility parameters 
6.) Identify functional groups present on compound(s)
7.). Examine chemical reactivity patterns using QSAR models  
8.Consider metabolic stability profiles   
9 ]. Investigate potential genotoxicity effects    
10]. Analyze mutagenic properties     
11] Estimate carcinogenic risk based upon structural alerts      
12 ] Assess irritant/sensitizer status via patch testing studies        
13].[Determine if itâ€™s photoactive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.gov/pmc/articles/journals/nmrc/)       
14.[Evaluate its ability as allergen by studying immune reactions from patients exposed at various doses over time.]         
15][Check whether there's any evidence suggesting hormonal disruption due exposure levels being exceeded during development stages etc., e.g estrogen-like activities seen after ingestion through contaminated water supplies)]( https: //pubmed.bio.mcmaster.ca/pubchem-lead-tox-database-a-novel-in-si... )
16[Examining how much this substance can bind onto proteins like albumin & what kind will help understand bioavailability issues associated w drug delivery systems used clinically!]
17 [Investigating metabolism pathways involved so we know where/how these substances get eliminated once inside our body helps us assess their half-life periods too :) ]
18[Evaluates oxidative stress caused; free radical generation capacity should also b considered here because they cause DNA damage leading cancerous cells proliferation..)]
19[Molecular docking simulations could provide insights into target binding affinites which would then guide further experiments needed before clinical trials commence].
