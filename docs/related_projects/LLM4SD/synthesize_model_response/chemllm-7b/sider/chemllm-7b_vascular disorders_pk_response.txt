Response from model: 
1) Calculate molecular weight.
2 ) Check for aromaticity
3.) Determine polarity index 
4). Identify functional groups present  
6 ). Look at lipophilicity (logP)
7.). Examine hydrogen bonding ability   
8.Consider electronegativity difference between atoms    
9 ]. Evaluate steric hindrance around reactive sites     
10]. Analyze solubility properties        
11].[Check] if thereâ€™s any known toxicological data available      
12.[Determine ] whether it has been used as drug before       
13.] Estimate its bioavailability         
14][Evaluate  its metabolism pathway(s)]          
15[Compare   it against other similar compounds]
16 [Analyze    the compound's stability under physiological conditions ]
17[Evaluating     if this substance can cross blood-brain barrier( BBB)]
18[Molecular dynamics simulations on how these substances interacted by their target proteins/ enzymes etc., using computational chemistry tools like AutoDock Vina & Glide X-Score software packages].
19[Categorize based upon structural similarity: e.g; phenylpiperidine derivatives vs benzodiazepines versus barbiturates- all have different mechanisms but share common structures which could help understand mechanism better than just looking only one class alone!
