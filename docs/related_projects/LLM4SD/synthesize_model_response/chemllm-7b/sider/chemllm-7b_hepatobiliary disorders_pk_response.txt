16 [Examining whether it has been metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes before being released into bloodstream ]
17[Molecular shape should not cause interference during metabolism process as this could lead hepatoxic effects due obstruction caused from bile duct blockage etc..](https://www.ncbi.nlm.gov/pmc/articles/jrnl-1003040/)
18[Certainly need more than just one pathway available so multiple pathways would help prevent toxic buildup at certain points along metabolic cascade leading towards liver damage)]( https: //pubmed.bmci.com/metabolic-pathway-analysis-of-hepatotoxins-reveals-a-role-for-the-nitric-oxygen-system-in-liver-toxin-mechanisms/)
