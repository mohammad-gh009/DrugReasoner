task name: G
Response from model: 
1: The greater number bonds in ring structures generally results lower boiling points.
2 Rule for predicting molecular geometry based on hybridization states
    - Sp-hybridized atoms form linear geometries 
   Sp² - trigonal planar; sp³ tetrahedral etc.,

4 : Molecules containing polar covalent bonding will have dipole moments due their uneven distribution charge across its two ends 

5  Molecular polarity increases as electronegativity difference between elements increase within same compound  

6 Molecular solubility depends upon whether it can dissolve into water by forming hydrogen-bonded complexes 


7 Hydrogen atom attached directly adjacent oxygen/ nitrogen usually forms acidic proton donors


8 Ionic compounds typically exhibit high melting point because strong electrostatic forces hold them together.


9 Boiling-point elevation occurs when non-volatile substances dissolved increasing intermolecule interactions via van der Waals' force 



10 Electron-donating groups decrease electron-withdrawing group’s ability towards nucleophilicity



11 Alkyl substituents reduce aromaticity but still retain some degree depending how many alkane chains present.



12 Carbocation stability decreases down Group IVa & Va metals since there's less effective shield from +ve charges coming off central metal cation core




13 Polarizability determines if organic species undergo addition reactions under UV light irradiations such like photoisomerizations during synthesis process...


14 Stereoelectronic effects play crucial role determining reaction mechanisms especially those involving multiple steps where stereochemistry matters greatly...
