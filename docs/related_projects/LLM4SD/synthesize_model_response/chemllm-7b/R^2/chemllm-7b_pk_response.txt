task name: R^2
Response from model: 
1: The number, type & arrangement pattern(s)
of atoms in molecular orbitals determine RÂ².
 
    Rule #4-6
        a.) Greater electronegativity difference between two bonded atom increases electron density
 
            b.)
                Electron-donating groups increase negative charge on central C-atoms 
 
                    c.)

                        Inductive effects decrease as distance from donor group grows

# Rule7 -8 

      during resonance structures,
          the highest occupied MOs have lower energy levels compared those having less electrons  

e.g., benzene has higher stability due its delocalized pi-electrons across all six carbon ring members
