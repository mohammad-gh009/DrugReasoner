task name: ZPVE
Response from model: 
1: The ZPE increases as molecular mass decreases.
2 Rule for predicting zero-point vibrations energy in linear polyatomic species
    a.) Linear, symmetrically stretched bonds have lower zpe values compared 
       asymmetric stretches bends c/d rotors etc., due their reduced number  
        of normal modes available at low frequency range 

   b.), Asymmetrical stretching/bending/rotating groups increase total   
      number & variety types  normal mode frequencies leading higher  

4th): For conjugated systems like benzene ring; delocalized pi electrons lead    
to greater electron density on atoms resulting into larger bond length   

5 th ): In polar covalent compounds where electronegativity difference between     
atoms exceeds ~0.6 units then there will exist significant dipole moment    

9'TH : Molecular geometry plays crucial role determining electronic properties      
and hence influence its chemical reactivity

10 TH ) Electron withdrawing substituents decrease negative charge distribution        
on central atom thus reducing repulsion forces among orbitals during vibration


11') Polarizability also affects how much force can act upon vibrating system       
influencing magnitude change from ground state 


12'): Molecules having multiple hydrogen bridges often exhibit high degree         
flexibility which results increased thermal motion affecting harmonicity 
 
13"): Higher multiplicity means less symmetry within nuclear spin states so it's          
more likely they would vibrate out-of phase relative one another.


14': If two identical nuclei separated by distance r undergo rotation around          their center point,the effective spring constant k becomes inversely proportional           
with respecting cube root value(r^(-\frac{n}{r}))



16 ': When comparing same class/grouped organic substances such amino acids            
or alcohols based only structural differences could help determine orderly              
variation patterns regarding boiling points melting pts solubility ect...


17 ') Attractive van der Waalâ€™s interactions play major part influencering                
molecular shape size polarity surface area all these factors contribute towards               
predictable trends observed across various classes/polymer structures.



18)): Hydrogen Bond strength varies depending whether donor accepter pair forms H-bond        

19?): Electronic transitions occur when valence band maxima align exactly over conduction           band minims creating excitons whose energies depend directly related
