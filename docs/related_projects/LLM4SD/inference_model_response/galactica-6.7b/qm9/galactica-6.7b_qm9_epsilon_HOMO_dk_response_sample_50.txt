2. Rule 2: The epsilon HOMO value of a molecule is also influenced by the electronegativity of the atoms present in the molecule. The more electronegative atoms present in the molecule, the lower the epsilon HOMO value.
3. Rule 3: The epsilon HOMO value of a molecule is also affected by the bond angles and bond lengths present in the molecule. A molecule with a more linear arrangement of bonds and shorter bond lengths has a lower epsilon HOMO value, indicating a more stable molecule.

================================

1. Rule 1: The epsilon HOMO value of a molecule is directly related to the number of pi electrons in the molecule. A molecule with more pi electrons has a higher epsilon HOMO value. For example, the molecule with the highest epsilon HOMO value, Cc1cc(CO)oc1N, has 10 pi electrons.
2. Rule 2: The epsilon HOMO value of a molecule is also influenced by the electronegativity of the atoms in the molecule. The more electronegative atoms in the molecule, the lower the epsilon HOMO value.

3. Rule 3: The epsilon HOMO value of a molecule is also affected by the resonance structures of the molecule. The more resonance structures a molecule has, the lower the epsilon HOMO value. For example, the molecule with the lowest epsilon HOMO value, Cc1nc2c([nH]1)CCO2, has only one resonance structure.
