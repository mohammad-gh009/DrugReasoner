1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of N=CNc1cncnc1 is -11240.250977, which is significantly lower than the G values of CC1(C)C[C@H]2C[C@@H](C1)C2 (-9589.186523) and c1nonc1CC1CC1 (-11374.106445).
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and position of functional groups present in the molecule. The presence of polar functional groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids can increase the G value of a molecule, while the presence of nonpolar functional groups such as alkanes and alkenes can decrease the G value. For example, the G value of C#C[C@@]12CO[C@H]3[C@@H](O1)[C@H]32 (-11444.111328) is higher than the G value of O[C@H]1[C@H]2C[C@@]13CCC[N@@H+]23 (-10968.852539), which has a polar functional group (-OH) at the same position.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also affected by the hybridization of carbon atoms in the molecule. The G value of a molecule increases as the carbon atoms become more sp3 hybridized. For example, the G value of C[C@@H]1[C@@H]2[CH-]C[C@@H]3[N@H+]1[C@@]32C (-9957.668945) is higher than the G value of O[C@H]1[C@H]2C[C@@]13CCC[N@@H+]23 (-10968.852539), which has a carbon atom with sp2 hybridization.

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of C[C@H]1C[C@](C)(C(N)=O)O1 (molecular weight = 271.16 g/mol) is -11982.717773, which is significantly lower than the G value of C#C[C@H](O)C[C@@H](C)O (molecular weight = 179.16 g/mol).
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and position of functional groups present in the molecule. The presence of polar functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH2), and carbonyl (-C=O) groups can increase the G value of a molecule, while the presence of nonpolar functional groups such as methyl (-CH3) and ethyl (-CH2CH3) groups can decrease the G value. For example, the G value of C[C@H]1[C@H]2[NH2+][CH+]O[C@H]1C2=O (molecular weight = 379.16 g/mol) is -11916.265625, which is higher than the G value of C[C@H]1[C@H]2[NH2+][CH+]O[C@H]1C2=O (molecular weight = 379.16 g/mol).
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the bond dissociation energies of the bonds present in the molecule. The stronger the bond between two atoms, the higher the G value of the molecule. For example, the G value of O=C1NC[C@H]2CC[C@H]2N1 (bond dissociation energy of C-N bond = 398 kJ/mol) is -11409.277344, which is higher than the G value of O=C1NC[C@H]2CC[C@H]2N1 (bond dissociation energy of C-

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular formula and structure. The G value is calculated by adding up the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule, multiplied by their respective coefficients in the molecular formula. For example, in the molecule CC(=O)/C(N)=N/CC#N, the G value is calculated as follows:
G value = (1 x 12.0109) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.0067) + (1 x 14.

2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is influenced by the presence of functional groups. The G value of a molecule can increase or decrease depending on the type and number of functional groups present in the molecule.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also affected by the arrangement of atoms in the molecule. The G value can vary depending on the conformation of the molecule.

================================

Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data:
1. The G value of a molecule is directly related to its structure and properties. The more complex the structure, the higher the G value.

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of ethane (C2H6) is -9960.471680, while the G value of propane (C3H8) is -11511.474609.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of double bonds present in the molecule. The more double bonds present, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of ethylene (C2H4) is -11409.160156, while the G value of butadiene (C4H6) is -11812.323242.

For example, the G value of C1=Cc2ncnn2C1 is -9733.616211, which is lower than the G value of N#CCCCO[CH+][NH-] (-10339.462891) due to its higher molecular weight.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and position of functional groups present in the molecule. The presence of polar functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH2), and carbonyl (-C=O) groups can increase the G value of a molecule, while nonpolar functional groups such as methyl (-CH3) and ethyl (-CH2CH3) groups can decrease the G value. For example, the G value of O=Cc1ncn2c1CC2 (-11343.123047) is higher than the G value of C[C@H]1CC[C@H]2C[C@@H](C1)O2 (-10567.017578) due to the presence of two polar carbonyl groups.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also affected by the bond dissociation energies of the bonds present in the molecule. The stronger the bond between two atoms, the higher the G value. For example, the G value of C[C@H]1CC[C@H]2C[C@@H](C1)O2 (-10567.017578) is lower than the G value of C[C@H]1C=Cc2ncnn21 (-10802.892578) due to the weaker bond between carbon and hydrogen atoms in the latter molecule.

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of CCCCC[C@H]1OCC1=O is -11544.901367, which is significantly lower than the G values of C1C[C@H]2[C@@H]3CC[C@H]2[C@H]1C3 (-9557.343750) and C[C@H]1[N@H+]2CC=C[C@@]12C#N (-10364.740234).
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and position of functional groups present in the molecule. The presence of polar functional groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones can increase the G value, while the presence of nonpolar functional groups such as alkanes and alkenes can decrease the G value. For example, the G value of C[C@H]1C[C@H]2C(=O)N[C@@]12C (-10971.728516) is higher than the G value of C[C@H]1C[C@H]2C(=O)N[C@@]12C (-10971.728516), which has a polar carbonyl group instead of a nonpolar double bond.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the stability of the molecule's resonance structures. The more stable the resonance structures, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of Cc1n[nH+]c([NH-])cc1N (-11272.162109) is lower than the G value of Cc1nc(C#N)[nH]c1O (-11781.356445), which has a less stable imine group instead of a more stable amine group.

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of OCCc1cnc(O)[nH]1 is -12387.076172, which is significantly lower than the G values of Cc1oc(C)c(C)c1C (-10535.934570) and CCO[C@H]1C[C@@]2(C)C[C@@H]12 (-10566.199219).
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and position of functional groups present in the molecule. The presence of polar functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH2), and carbonyl (-C=O) groups can increase the G value of a molecule, while the presence of nonpolar functional groups such as methyl (-CH3) and fluorine (-F) groups can decrease the G value. For example, the G value of C[C@]12OC[C@H]1[C@H]1[C@@H](O)[C@H]12 (-11510.076172) is higher than the G value of C[C@H]1CC=CN(C)C1=O (-10972.713867), which has a polar carbonyl group instead of a nonpolar methyl group.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also affected by the bond dissociation energies of the bonds present in the molecule. Stronger bonds have higher bond dissociation energies and require more energy to break, resulting in a lower G value. For example, the G value of C[C@]12C[C@H](C[N@H+]3C[C@H]31)C2 (-9992.420898) is lower than the G value of C[C@]12N[C@H]1[C@H]1C[C@H]12 (-7852.835938), which has weaker bonds between the carbon and nitrogen atoms due to the absence of a hydrogen atom on the

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of C#C[C@]12C[N@H+]3C[C@H]3[C@H]1N2 is -10362.384766, which is lower than the G values of CCCCC1(C#N)CC1 (-8924.650391) and Cc1nc(NC=N)co1 (-11813.750000). This is because the molecular weight of the first molecule is higher than those of the other two molecules.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of double bonds present in the molecule. The more double bonds present, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of C[C@H]1[C@@H]2[C@H]3[C@@H]4[C@H]([N@H+]31)[C@@]42C (-9958.244141) is lower than the G value of CO[C@@]12C(=O)N[C@@H]1[C@@H]2O (-12925.897461), which has one less double bond. This is because the second molecule has one more double bond than the first molecule.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. The G value can be either increased or decreased depending on the type of functional group present. For example, the G value of C1=C([C@H]2CO2)COC1 (-10442.262695) is lower than the G value of C1=C([C@H]2CO2)COC1=O (-10500.103516), which has a carbonyl group (-O=C=O) instead of a double bond. This is because the carbonyl group has a higher electronegativity than the double bond, which makes it more electron-withdrawing and destabilizing, resulting in a lower G value.

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of the molecule CC(=O)N(C)[C@@H](C)C#N is -11409.477539, which is significantly lower than the G values of the other molecules listed in the table.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and position of functional groups present in the molecule. The presence of polar functional groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids can increase the G value of a molecule, while the presence of nonpolar functional groups such as hydrocarbons and nitriles can decrease the G value. For example, the G value of the molecule C[C@]12N[C@H]1[C@@H](O)[C@H]2C=O is -11948.012695, which is higher than the G value of the molecule CO[C@H]1CO[C@]1(C)C#N.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also affected by the presence of double bonds or rings in the molecule. The presence of double bonds or rings can increase the G value of a molecule, while the absence of these structures can decrease the G value. For example, the G value of the molecule C1=CC2=CC[C@@H]3C[C@]23C1 is -9491.233398, which is higher than the G value of the molecule Cc1ccccn1.

================================

2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and position of functional groups present in the molecule. The presence of polar functional groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones can increase the G value of a molecule, while the presence of nonpolar functional groups such as alkanes and alkenes can decrease the G value. For example, the G value of the molecule C[C@H]1O[C@]12[C@@H]1N[C@H]2[C@@H]1O is higher than that of the molecule O[C@]12[C@@H]3C=C[C@H]1[C@@]2(O)C3 because the former has two polar functional groups (an alcohol and an ether), while the latter has only one polar functional group (an alcohol).
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the bond dissociation energies of the bonds present in the molecule. The stronger the bond between two atoms, the higher the G value of the molecule. For example, the G value of the molecule NC(=O)c1noc(N)n1 is higher than that of the molecule N#CC1=NC[C@@H](O)CO1 because the bond dissociation energy of the C-N bond in the former is higher than that of the C-N bond in the latter.

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of N#Cc1cn[nH]c1C=O is -11748.444336, which is significantly lower than the G values of the other molecules listed in the table.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and position of functional groups present in the molecule. The presence of polar functional groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids can increase the G value of a molecule, while the presence of nonpolar functional groups such as hydrocarbons can decrease the G value. For example, the G value of C#CC[N@@H+]1CC[C@H]1C#C is -9925.229492, which is higher than the G value of O=C[C@H]1[C@H]2CC(=O)[C@@H]1N2 (-11915.948242).
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also affected by the presence of double bonds or rings in the molecule. The presence of double bonds or rings can increase the G value of a molecule, while the absence of these structures can decrease the G value. For example, the G value of c1cc([C@H]2CO2)n[nH]1 is -10306.188477, which is higher than the G value of O=C1C[C@H]2[C@@H]1[C@H]1CC[N@H+]12 (-10937.011719).

================================

Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data:
1. The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular structure. The more complex the molecular structure, the higher the G value. For example, the G value of the molecule CC1(C)C[C@H]2C[N@H+]2C1 is higher than that of the molecule C[C@H]1[C@H]2C[C@]1(O)C2NO because the former has a more complex structure with multiple functional groups.
2. The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the electronegativity of the atoms in the molecule. The more electronegative the atoms, the higher the G value. For example, the G value of the molecule N#CC1=NCC(=O)CN1 is higher than that of the molecule CNc1[nH]cnc1O because the nitrogen atom in the former has a higher electronegativity than the carbon atom in the latter.
3. The G value of a molecule is affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. The presence of certain functional groups can increase or decrease the G value of a molecule. For example, the G value of the molecule COC(C)(C)[C@@H](O)C=O is higher than that of the molecule C[C@H]1[C@H]2C[C@]1(O)C2NO because the former has a carbonyl group (-C=O) which is a polar functional group that increases the polarity of the molecule, making it more reactive.

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of the first molecule in the list is -11914.799805, which is significantly lower than the G values of the other molecules listed.
2. Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, amides, and carboxylic acids can significantly affect the G value of a molecule. For instance, the second molecule in the list contains a ketone group, which has a negative effect on its G value compared to the other molecules. On the other hand, the third molecule contains an amide group, which has a positive effect on its G value.
3. Rule 3: The position and number of functional groups in a molecule can also have an impact on its G value. For example, the fourth molecule in the list contains two carbonyl groups, which have a negative effect on its G value compared to the other molecules. However, the fifth molecule in the list contains only one carbonyl group, which has a positive effect on its G value.

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, in the given data, the molecule with the highest molecular weight has the lowest G value, while the molecule with the lowest molecular weight has the highest G value.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of atoms in its structure. The more atoms in a molecule, the lower the G value. For example, in the given data, the molecule with the highest number of atoms (10) has the lowest G value, while the molecule with the lowest number of atoms (1) has the highest G value.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is influenced by the type of bonds present in its structure. The presence of polar bonds or double bonds can increase the G value of a molecule, while the presence of nonpolar bonds or single bonds can decrease the G value. For example, in the given data, the molecule with the highest G value contains polar bonds, while the molecule with the lowest G value contains nonpolar bonds.

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of CO[C@@]1(C)C[C@H]2C[C@H]2C1 is -10566.716797, which is lower than the G value of Nc1cnoc1[C@H]1CN1 (-11811.280273) due to its higher molecular weight.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of double bonds present in the molecule. The more double bonds a molecule has, the lower its G value. For example, the G value of C#C[C@@H]1[C@@H]2[C@H](C)[C@H](C)[N@@H+]21 (-9958.391602) is lower than the G value of C#C[C@@]12C[C@@H]1C[C@@H]2CO (-10499.684570) due to the presence of one double bond in the former molecule.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also affected by the electronegativity of the atoms present in the molecule. The more electronegative atoms a molecule contains, the lower its G value. For example, the G value of CN(C)c1cc(O)c[nH]1 (-11408.502930) is lower than the G value of CC[C@@H]1C(=O)N[C@@H]1CO (-11982.329102) due to the presence of nitrogen, which is more electronegative than carbon.

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of C1OC[C@H]2N[C@@H]12 is -7795.752930, which is significantly lower than the G values of the other molecules listed in the table.
2. Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and amides can significantly affect the G value of a molecule. For instance, the G value of OCC#Cc1cnoc1 is -11882.503906, which is significantly lower than the G values of the other molecules listed in the table. This is because the carbonyl group (C=O) present in the molecule has a high electronegativity, which makes it more polar and reactive.
3. Rule 3: The position and number of functional groups in a molecule can also have an impact on its G value. For example, the G value of CCCn1ncnc1O is -11846.181641, which is significantly lower than the G values of the other molecules listed in the table. This is because the two carbonyl groups (C=O) present in the molecule are located at the end of the molecule, making it more polar and reactive.

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of C[NH+](C)CC(=O)CCO is -12014.287109, which is significantly lower than the G value of C[C@H]1C[C@H]2[C@@H](C#N)[C@@]12C at -9960.597656.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and position of functional groups present in the molecule. The presence of polar functional groups such as NH+, CO, and OH- can increase the G value, while the presence of nonpolar functional groups such as CH3 and CH2 can decrease the G value. For example, the G value of C[C@H]1C=Cc2ccoc21 is -10469.666992, which is lower than the G value of C[C@H]1C=Cc2ccoc21 with a polar functional group on one of the carbon atoms at -10469.666992.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the bond dissociation energies of the bonds present in the molecule. The stronger the bond between two atoms, the higher the G value. For example, the G value of N#CCN[C@@H]1COC1=O is -12353.724609, which is higher than the G value of CC1=C[C@H]2C=C[C@@H]1[C@H]2O at -10501.416016.

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of ON[C@@H]1C[C@@H]2[C@H]1C[C@@H]2O is -11946.991211, which is lower than the G value of C#C[C@@H]1C[C@@H]2[C@H](O)[C@]12O (-11477.322266) due to its higher molecular weight.
2. Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl (C=O), hydroxyl (-OH), and amino (-NH2) groups can significantly affect the G value of a molecule. For instance, the G value of OCC1=CCCC1NO (-11948.289062) is lower than the G value of O[C@H]1C=C[C@H]2C=CC[C@H]21 (-10502.014648) due to the presence of a carbonyl group in the latter molecule. Similarly, the G value of O[C@]12CC=C[C@H](C1)C2  (-9465.037109) is lower than the G value of O[C@]12CC=C[C@H](C1)C2  (-9465.037109) due to the absence of a hydroxyl group in the former molecule.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and position of double bonds in its structure. The presence of multiple double bonds can increase the G value, while the presence of single or triple bonds can decrease it. For example, the G value of Nc1c[nH+]c2nn[nH]n12 (-12112.247070) is higher than the G value of O=C1O[C@H]2C[C@@]13CC[C@@H]23 (-11477.815430) due to the presence of multiple double bonds in the former molecule. Additionally, the G value of CC(

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of C#Cc1nonc1N is -10708.690430, which is significantly lower than the G values of Cc1cc2ncoc2[nH]1 (-11343.842773) and N#C[C@]12C[C@H]1[C@H]1C[N@H+]12 (-9293.649414).
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of double bonds present in the molecule. The more double bonds a molecule has, the lower its G value. For example, the G value of C1=C2COCO[C@H]2CC1 (-11512.241211) is significantly lower than the G value of C[C@]12C[C@H](C[C@H]3C[C@H]31)O2 (-10533.726562).
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. The G value can be either increased or decreased depending on the type of functional group present. For example, the G value of COC(=O)C(=N)N(C)C (-12419.250000) is significantly lower than the G value of O[C@]12C=C[C@@H]3[C@H](C1)[C@@H]32 (-9431.435547), which contains a carbonyl group.

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, as heavier molecules have higher G values. This can be attributed to the fact that heavier molecules have more atoms and bonds, which results in a greater number of electrons and energy levels.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the electronegativity of the atoms present in the molecule. Atoms with higher electronegativities have a stronger pull on the electrons, which results in a higher energy level and a higher G value.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. Functional groups contain atoms with specific chemical properties, such as hydroxyl (-OH), carbonyl (-C=O), or amino (-NH2) groups, which can affect the G value by altering the molecule's electronic structure. For example, the presence of a hydroxyl group in a molecule can increase its G value due to the hydrogen bonding it can form with other molecules.

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, in the given data, the molecule with the highest molecular weight has the lowest G value, while the molecule with the lowest molecular weight has the highest G value.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of atoms in its structure. The more atoms in a molecule, the lower the G value. For example, in the given data, the molecule with the highest number of atoms (11) has the lowest G value, while the molecule with the lowest number of atoms (3) has the highest G value.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is influenced by the electronegativity of its atoms. The more electronegative the atoms in a molecule, the lower the G value. For example, in the given data, the molecule with the most electronegative atom (nitrogen) has the lowest G value, while the molecule with the least electronegative atom (hydrogen) has the highest G value.

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of NC(=O)CC1(O)CCC1 (-11982.525391) is lower than that of CC[C@@]1(C)[C@@H](C=O)[N@H+]1C (-11003.460938) because the molecular weight of the first molecule (394.38 g/mol) is lower than that of the second molecule (414.40 g/mol).
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of double bonds in its structure. The more double bonds a molecule has, the lower its G value. For example, the G value of C#CCOC(C)(C)CC (-10565.931641) is lower than that of CO[C@H]1C[C@](O)(C#N)C1 (-11948.704102) because the first molecule has one double bond while the second molecule has two double bonds.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also affected by the presence of functional groups in its structure. The presence of certain functional groups can increase or decrease the G value of a molecule. For example, the G value of COC(=O)[C@H]1CC(=O)N1 (-12928.347656) is lower than that of C[C@H]1C[NH2+][C@H]2OC[C@H]2N1 (-11407.566406) because the first molecule has a carbonyl group (-C=O) while the second molecule has a secondary amine group (-NH2+).

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of the molecule C[C@H]1[C@H]2[C@H]3O[C@@H]([NH-])[C@@H]1[C@H]32 is -10938.084961, which is lower than the G value of the molecule CN(C)c1c[nH]nn1 (-10234.767578). This is because the molecular weight of the first molecule is higher than the second molecule.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of double bonds in its structure. The more double bonds a molecule has, the lower its G value. For example, the G value of the molecule O=CNC(=O)C1CC1 (-10881.041992) is lower than the G value of the molecule C[C@H]1N[C@]1(C)C[C@@H](C)O (-11036.285156), which has one less double bond. This is because the second molecule has one more single bond than the first molecule.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also affected by the presence of functional groups in its structure. The G value can be either increased or decreased depending on the type of functional group present. For example, the G value of the molecule C[C@H]1[C@H]2[C@@H](N)[C@@H](C#N)[N@H+]21 (-10833.251953) is lower than the G value of the molecule C[C@H]1[C@H]2[C@H](N)[C@@H](C#N)[N@H+]21 (-10833.251953), which has a hydroxyl group instead of a hydrogen atom at the nitrogen atom. This is because the hydroxyl group has a higher electronegativity than the hydrogen atom, which makes it a stronger electron donor and therefore more stable.

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of CCC1(O)CCOCC1 is -11577.791016, which is lower than the G values of CO[C@@]1(C#N)C[N@H+]2C[C@H]21 (-11373.970703) and C[C@]1(CO)[C@@H]2[NH2+][CH+]O[C@@H]21 (-11948.650391). This is because the molecular weight of CCC1(O)CCOCC1 is lower than those of the other two molecules.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of double bonds present in the molecule. The more double bonds present, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of C[C@H]1NCc2ncoc21 (-11375.892578) is lower than the G value of C#C[C@@H]1[C@@H]2C[C@@H]2[C@H]1NO (-10902.765625), which has one less double bond. This is because the molecular weight of C[C@H]1NCc2ncoc21 is lower than that of C#C[C@@H]1[C@@H]2C[C@@H]2[C@H]1NO, and therefore, the G value is lower.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. The G value can be either increased or decreased depending on the type of functional group present. For example, the G value of O=C1OC[C@@]1(O)C1CC1 (-12489.953125) is lower than the G value of C#C[C@H](C)/N=C(\N)OC (-11407.513672),

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, in the given data, the molecule with the highest molecular weight has the lowest G value, while the molecule with the lowest molecular weight has the highest G value.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of atoms in its structure. The more atoms in a molecule, the lower the G value. For example, in the given data, the molecule with the highest number of atoms has the lowest G value, while the molecule with the lowest number of atoms has the highest G value.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is influenced by the type of bonds present in its structure. The presence of polar bonds or double bonds can increase the G value of a molecule, while the presence of nonpolar bonds or single bonds can decrease the G value. For example, in the given data, the molecule with the highest G value contains polar bonds, while the molecule with the lowest G value contains nonpolar bonds.

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of O=C(C1CCC1)N1CC1 is -10970.880859, which is lower than the G values of OC[C@@H](O)C12CC(C1)C2 (-11543.142578) and C#C[C@H](OC)[C@@H](O)C#C (-11476.851562). This is because the molecular weight of O=C(C1CCC1)N1CC1 is lower than those of OC[C@@H](O)C12CC(C1)C2 and C#C[C@H](OC)[C@@H](O)C#C.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of double bonds present in the molecule. The more double bonds present, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of O=CC1(CCO)CCC1 (-11544.576172) is lower than the G value of C#CC1(OCC)CC1 (-9463.657227), which has one less double bond. This is because the molecular weight of O=CC1(CCO)CCC1 is lower than that of C#CC1(OCC)CC1, which has one less double bond.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. The presence of certain functional groups can increase or decrease the G value depending on the specific functional group and the molecule it is present in. For example, the G value of C[C@H]1[C@H]2C[C@]1([NH+]1CC1)C2 (-9991.100586) is lower than the G value of C[C@H]1[C@H](O)[C@H]2C(=O)C[C@@H]12 (-11511.765625), which has a carbonyl group (=O) instead

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of c1nc2c(o1)C[N@@H+]1C[C@H]21 is -11342.441406, which is lower than the G value of CNc1c[nH]nc1NC (-11304.176758) due to its higher molecular weight.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and position of functional groups present in the molecule. The presence of polar functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH2), and carbonyl (-C=O) groups can increase the G value of a molecule, while nonpolar functional groups such as methyl (-CH3) and fluorine (-F) groups can decrease the G value. For example, the G value of O=CC1=CC(=O)[C@H]2C[C@@H]12 (-11447.497070) is higher than the G value of C1C[C@]23OC[C@H]2[N@@H+]2[C@H]1[C@@H]23 (-10936.445312) due to the presence of two carbonyl groups.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also affected by the bond dissociation energies of the bonds present in the molecule. The stronger the bond between two atoms, the higher the G value. For example, the G value of COc1ccc(F)cn1 (-12571.658203) is higher than the G value of Cc1nccnc1O (-10308.231445) due to the stronger bond between carbon and fluorine atoms compared to carbon and oxygen atoms.

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of C1C[C@H]2O[C@]23CO[C@H]3[NH2+]1 is -11915.494141, which is lower than the G values of C#C[C@H](C#N)OC1CC1 (-10904.086914) and C1=NC[C@H]2[C@H]3[C@H](C[N@H+]32)O1 (-11374.028320) because they have higher molecular weights.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and position of functional groups present in the molecule. The presence of polar functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH2), and carbonyl (-C=O) groups can increase the polarity of the molecule and decrease its G value. On the other hand, the presence of nonpolar functional groups such as hydrocarbons (-CH3) and aromatic rings (-C6H5) can decrease the polarity of the molecule and increase its G value. For example, the G value of COC(=O)C[C@H]1C[C@H]1C (-11545.492188) is lower than the G value of CNc1n[nH]c(=O)o1 (-11755.000977) because the former has a polar carbonyl group while the latter has a nonpolar hydrocarbon chain.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the bond dissociation energies of the bonds present in the molecule. The stronger the bond between two atoms, the higher the bond dissociation energy, and the lower the G value. For example, the G value of COCCc1ccco1 (-11512.618164) is lower than the G value of O=C[C@]1(O)[C@H]2C=C[C@H]1N2 (-

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of the molecule C[N@@H+]1[C@H]2C=C[C@@H]1[C@]2(C)O is -10969.104492, which is significantly lower than the G values of the other molecules listed in the table.
2. Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, amides, and carboxylic acids can significantly affect the G value of a molecule. For instance, the G value of the molecule CC#CCCC(N)=O is -9902.788086, which is significantly lower than the G values of the other molecules listed in the table. This is because the carbonyl group present in the molecule CC#CCCC(N)=O has a high electronegativity, which makes it a strong electron-withdrawing group. Therefore, the molecule is more stable and has a lower G value.
3. Rule 3: The position and number of functional groups in a molecule can also have an impact on its G value. For example, the G value of the molecule Nc1noc2cnoc12 is -12756.106445, which is significantly lower than the G values of the other molecules listed in the table. This is because the two carbonyl groups present in the molecule Nc1noc2cnoc12 are located at the end of the molecule, which makes them more accessible for reaction and interaction with other molecules. Therefore, the molecule is more reactive and has a lower G value.

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of CC1=C[C@@H](CO)[C@@H](C)C1 is -10567.378906, which is lower than the G values of Cc1occc1C(N)=O (-11918.425781) and N#CCOc1ccon1 (-12320.400391). This is because the molecular weight of CC1=C[C@@H](CO)[C@@H](C)C1 is lower than those of Cc1occc1C(N)=O and N#CCOc1ccon1.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of double bonds in its structure. The more double bonds a molecule has, the lower its G value. For example, the G value of C[C@]12CC[N@@H+]3[C@H]1[C@]3(C)C2 is -9992.798828, which is lower than the G values of C[C@H]1[C@H]2CC[C@@H]1C21CC1 (-9555.751953) and c1cn2c(n1)N1C[C@H]1C2 (-10802.038086). This is because the former molecule has two double bonds, while the latter two molecules have one double bond.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also affected by the presence of functional groups in its structure. The presence of certain functional groups can increase or decrease the G value of a molecule. For example, the G value of O=C1/C=C\CO/C=N\C1 is -11916.464844, which is lower than the G values of Nc1nnn2c1[C@@H](O)C2 (-12247.953125) and CO[C@H]1[C@H]2C[

3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is affected by the electronegativity of its atoms. The more electronegative the atoms in a molecule, the lower the G value. For example, the molecule with the formula COC1(O)[C@@H]2O[C@H]1[C@H]2O has a lower G value than the molecule with the formula COC1(O)[C@H]2O[C@H]1[C@H]2O.

================================

3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also affected by the presence of functional groups. The G value can be either increased or decreased depending on the type of functional group present in the molecule. For example, the G value of C1=C[C@H]2O[C@]3(C1)CC[C@H]23 (-10500.491211) is lower than that of C[C@@H](O)CC1OCCO1 (-12555.318359) because the former has a hydroxyl group (-OH) while the latter does not.

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, in the given data, the molecule with the highest molecular weight has the lowest G value, while the molecule with the lowest molecular weight has the highest G value.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of atoms in its structure. The more atoms in a molecule, the lower the G value. For example, in the given data, the molecule with the highest number of atoms (11) has the lowest G value, while the molecule with the lowest number of atoms (1) has the highest G value.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is influenced by the type of bonds present in its structure. The presence of polar bonds or double bonds can increase the G value of a molecule, while the presence of nonpolar bonds or single bonds can decrease the G value. For example, in the given data, the molecule with the highest G value contains polar bonds, while the molecule with the lowest G value contains nonpolar bonds.

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of the molecule CC(C)[C@H]1[C@H]2C[C@]1(O)C2 is -10565.736328, which is lower than the G value of the molecule O[C@@H](CC1CC1)C1CC1, which is -10566.083008. This is because the molecular weight of the first molecule is higher than the second molecule.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of double bonds present in the molecule. The more double bonds present in the molecule, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of the molecule Cc1onc2[nH]cnc12 is -11779.959961, which is lower than the G value of the molecule CNc1nnc(NC)o1, which is -12282.337891. This is because the first molecule has two double bonds, while the second molecule has one double bond.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. The presence of certain functional groups can increase or decrease the G value of the molecule. For example, the G value of the molecule CO[C@H]1[C@H]2COC=N[C@H]21 is -11948.416016, which is lower than the G value of the molecule CN1C(=O)[C@H]2OC[C@]21C, which is -11948.910156. This is because the first molecule has a carbonyl group (C=O), which decreases the G value, while the second molecule does not have a carbonyl group.

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, in the given data, the molecule with the highest molecular weight has the lowest G value, while the molecule with the lowest molecular weight has the highest G value.
2. Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, amides, and carboxylic acids can significantly affect the G value of a molecule. For instance, the molecule with the aldehyde group has a lower G value than the molecule without it, while the molecule with the ketone group has a higher G value than the molecule without it. Similarly, the presence of the amide group can increase or decrease the G value depending on the position of the nitrogen atom in the molecule.
3. Rule 3: The arrangement of atoms in a molecule can also affect its G value. For example, the molecule with a linear structure has a lower G value than the molecule with a branched structure, and the molecule with a cyclic structure has a higher G value than the molecule with a linear structure. Additionally, the number of double bonds in a molecule can also affect its G value, with molecules containing more double bonds having a lower G value.

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of C[NH2+]C1CCCC(=O)N1 is -11409.890625, which is lower than the G values of the other three molecules listed in the table.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and position of functional groups present in the molecule. The presence of polar functional groups such as NH2+, OH-, and COOH- can increase the G value of a molecule, while the presence of nonpolar functional groups such as CH3- and CH2- can decrease the G value. For example, the G value of C#C[C@]12N[C@@H]3[C@H]1OC[C@@H]32 is -10902.922852, which is higher than the G value of C[C@]12CC[N@H+]3C[C@H]3[C@H]1O2.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also affected by the bond dissociation energies of the bonds present in the molecule. The stronger the bond between two atoms, the higher the G value of the molecule. For example, the G value of O=CC(=O)n1cccc1 is -11885.251953, which is higher than the G value of O=C1O[C@H]2C[C@H]3O[C@H]3[C@@H]12.

For example, in the given data, the molecule with the highest molecular weight has the lowest G value, while the molecule with the lowest molecular weight has the highest G value.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of atoms in its structure. The more atoms in a molecule, the lower the G value. For example, in the given data, the molecule with the highest number of atoms (11) has the lowest G value, while the molecule with the lowest number of atoms (3) has the highest G value.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is influenced by the type of bonds present in its structure. The presence of polar bonds or double bonds can increase the G value of a molecule, while the presence of nonpolar bonds or single bonds can decrease the G value. For example, in the given data, the molecule with the highest G value contains polar bonds, while the molecule with the lowest G value contains nonpolar bonds.

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the higher the G value. For example, the G value of CCCn1ncc(N)n1 is higher than that of Oc1cnc2n1CC=C2 because the molecular weight of the former is higher.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of double bonds present in the molecule. The more double bonds present, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of C1=C[C@]2(CO2)[C@@H]2O[C@H]12 is lower than that of CO[C@@H]1C=CC2(CC2)C1 because the former has one double bond while the latter has two double bonds.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. The G value can be either increased or decreased depending on the type of functional group present. For example, the G value of C#C[C@@]12[C@H]3[C@H]4[C@@H]1[C@]2(C)[N@H+]43 is higher than that of N#C[C@@H]1C[C@@]2(CO)C[C@@H]12 because the former has a tertiary amine group while the latter has a secondary amine group.

================================

1. Rule 1: The G value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the G value. For example, the G value of N=C(CO)NC(=N)CO is lower than that of O=Cc1cnon1 because the molecular weight of the former is higher than the latter.
2. Rule 2: The G value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and position of functional groups present in the molecule. The presence of polar functional groups such as NH2+, OH-, and COOH- can increase the G value of a molecule, while the presence of nonpolar functional groups such as CH3- and CH2- can decrease it. For example, the G value of C[C@]12C=C[C@](C)(C1)C2 is higher than that of CO[CH+]Nc1cnoc1 because the former has more polar functional groups.
3. Rule 3: The G value of a molecule is also affected by the bond dissociation energies of the bonds present in the molecule. The stronger the bond, the higher the G value. For example, the G value of C/C1=C/C=C\CCOC1 is higher than that of COC(=O)C(=O)C#N because the former has a stronger double bond between carbon atoms.
