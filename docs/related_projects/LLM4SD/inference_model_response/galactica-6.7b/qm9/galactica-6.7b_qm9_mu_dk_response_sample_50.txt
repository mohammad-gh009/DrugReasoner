1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of C1=C2CCCO[C@H]2OC1 is 2.894300, which is lower than the Mu value of C[C@@H](O)[C@H]1C[C@H]1C(N)=O (4.285200) because the molecular weight of the first molecule is lower than the second molecule.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of carbon atoms in the molecule. The more carbon atoms in a molecule, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of C[C@H]1O[C@H]2C[C@H]2C12CC2 (1.322800) is lower than the Mu value of C[C@H](CCO)NCC#N (6.076800) because the former has fewer carbon atoms than the latter.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. Functional groups can increase or decrease the Mu value of a molecule depending on their chemical properties. For example, the Mu value of C#C[C@@H]1C(=O)[C@H]2[C@@H](O)[C@H]21 (3.243200) is higher than the Mu value of C[C@@H](CCO)NCC#N (6.076800) because the former contains a carbonyl group (C=O), which increases the Mu value.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is calculated by adding the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule. The Mu value of a molecule increases as its molecular weight increases. For example, the Mu value of ethane (C2H6) is 3.008600, while the Mu value of propane (C3H8) is 3.191600.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of double bonds and aromatic rings present in the molecule. The Mu value of a molecule increases as the number of double bonds and aromatic rings increase. For example, the Mu value of ethylene (C2H4) is 4.879000, while the Mu value of benzene (C6H6) is 4.763700.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also affected by the electronegativity of the atoms in the molecule. The Mu value of a molecule decreases as the electronegativity of the atoms in the molecule increases. For example, the Mu value of ammonia (NH3) is 4.879000, while the Mu value of carbon dioxide (CO2) is 1.330400.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is calculated by adding the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule. The Mu value is usually expressed in daltons (Da) or atomic mass units (amu). For example, the Mu value of C#CCC#CC#CCC is 0.9026 Da, which is equal to the molecular weight of the molecule. Similarly, the Mu values of the other molecules can be calculated using their molecular formulas and atomic weights.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and type of functional groups present in the molecule. Functional groups are chemical groups that have specific chemical properties and are responsible for the reactivity and behavior of a molecule. The Mu value of a molecule can increase or decrease depending on the presence of functional groups. For example, the Mu value of C[C@H]1[NH2+][C@H]2NC[C@H]2[C@H]1O is higher than that of C[C@H]1CC[C@]12[C@H](O)[C@@H]2O because the former has an additional amino group that increases its molecular weight. Similarly, the Mu value of C[C@H]1N[C@]12C[C@@H](C#N)C2 is lower than that of N#CCNc1ccco1 because the former has a double bond between carbon atoms that decreases its molecular weight.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also affected by the arrangement of atoms in the molecule. The Mu value of a molecule can change depending on the position of functional groups and the number of rings in the molecule. For example, the Mu value of C[C@H]1N[C@]12C[C@@H](C#N)C2 is higher than that of C[C@H]1N[C@]12C[C@@H](C#N)C2 because the former has a double bond between carbon atoms that decreases its molecular weight, while the latter has a single bond between carbon atoms that increases its molecular weight. Additionally, the Mu value of C[C@H]1N[C@]12C[C@@H](C#N)C2 is higher than that of C[C@H]

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of carbon dioxide (CO2) is 0.720100, while the Mu value of methane (CH4) is 1.802800.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and position of functional groups present in the molecule. The presence of polar functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH2), and carbonyl (-C=O) groups can increase the Mu value of a molecule, while the presence of nonpolar functional groups such as hydrocarbons (-CH3) can decrease the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of ethanol (C2H5OH) is 3.814000, while the Mu value of methanol (CH3OH) is 3.814000.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the bond angles and lengths between atoms in the molecule. The presence of bent bonds or strained rings can increase the Mu value of a molecule, while the presence of linear bonds or unstrained rings can decrease the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of cyclobutane (C4H8) is 2.679600, while the Mu value of benzene (C6H6) is 2.679600.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is determined by the number of atoms in the molecule and their atomic weights. The Mu value can be calculated by multiplying the molecular weight by the Avogadro constant (6.022 x 10^23). For example, the Mu value of the first molecule in the data set is 1.5222 x 6.022 x 10^23 = 9.055 x 10^25.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the electronegativity of the atoms in the molecule. The more electronegative atoms in the molecule, the greater the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of the second molecule in the data set is 2.8399 x 6.022 x 10^23 = 1.802 x 10^26, which is higher than the Mu value of the first molecule.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. Functional groups are chemical groups that have specific chemical properties and are responsible for the reactivity of the molecule. The Mu value of a molecule can be increased or decreased depending on the type and number of functional groups present in the molecule. For example, the Mu value of the third molecule in the data set is 1.1069 x 6.022 x 10^23 = 6.519 x 10^25, which is lower than the Mu value of the first molecule. However, the Mu value of the fourth molecule in the data set is 1.2225 x 6.022 x 10^23 = 7.116 x 10^25, which is higher than the Mu value of the third molecule.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is determined by the number of atoms in the molecule and their atomic weights. The Mu value of a molecule increases as the molecular weight increases. For example, the Mu value of methane (CH4) is 1.671800, while the Mu value of ethane (C2H6) is 3.111500.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the electronegativity of the atoms in the molecule. The more electronegative atoms in a molecule, the greater its Mu value. For example, the Mu value of carbon dioxide (CO2) is 1.671800, while the Mu value of carbon monoxide (CO) is 3.059700.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. The Mu value of a molecule can be increased or decreased by the presence of functional groups. For example, the Mu value of ethanol (C2H5OH) is 4.879300, while the Mu value of methanol (CH3OH) is 3.113700.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of C#Cc1nc(C)c(N)[nH]1 is 3.691100, which is higher than the Mu value of N#C[C@@]12C[C@H]3O[C@@H]1C[C@H]32 (3.352200) because the molecular weight of the first molecule (31.01 g/mol) is higher than the molecular weight of the second molecule (28.01 g/mol).
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of carbon atoms in the molecule. The more carbon atoms in a molecule, the lower the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of COC[C@H]1[C@@H](C)C1(C)C (0.956500) is lower than the Mu value of C1=C2[C@H]3C[C@H](C3)[C@@H]2CC1 (0.552900) because the first molecule has one more carbon atom than the second molecule.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. The Mu value can increase or decrease depending on the type of functional group present. For example, the Mu value of N#C[C@@H]1CC(=O)CN1 (3.168000) is higher than the Mu value of C[N@@H+]1CC[C@@]1(C=O)CO (2.081900) because the former molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), which increases the molecular weight and therefore the Mu value. However, the Mu value of OCCNc1cnco1 (4.333900) is lower than the Mu value of Cc1cc(CCO)c[nH]1 (2.690700) because the former molecule contains a double bond between carbon atoms, which decreases the molecular weight and therefore the Mu value.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of NH3 (molecular weight = 17) is 2.2577, while the Mu value of CH4 (molecular weight = 16) is 1.8305.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and type of functional groups present in the molecule. Functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH2), carbonyl (-C=O), and carboxylic acid (-COOH) have higher Mu values compared to other functional groups. For example, the Mu value of ethanol (CH3CH2OH) is 1.8305, while the Mu value of methanol (CH3OH) is 1.6505.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also affected by the hybridization of the carbon atoms in the molecule. sp3 hybridized carbon atoms have higher Mu values compared to sp2 hybridized carbon atoms. For example, the Mu value of ethane (C2H6) is 1.0566, while the Mu value of ethylene (C2H4) is 1.5283.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is determined by the number of atoms in the molecule and their atomic weights. The Mu value of a molecule increases as the molecular weight increases. For example, the Mu value of C[C@H]1C[C@H]2N[C@@H](C#N)[C@@H]12 is higher than that of C#CCC(O)(CO)CO because the former has a higher molecular weight due to the presence of nitrogen and carbon-carbon double bonds.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the electronegativity of the atoms in the molecule. The more electronegative atoms in a molecule, such as oxygen and nitrogen, tend to have higher Mu values compared to less electronegative atoms like hydrogen and carbon. For example, the Mu value of O=C[C@@H]1[C@@H]2[C@H]3[C@@H](O)[C@@H]2[N@H+]31 is higher than that of O[C@]12[C@@H]3C[C@@H]4C[C@H]1[C@H]2[N@@H+]43 because the former has more electronegative oxygen atoms.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule can also be affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. Functional groups are chemical groups that have specific chemical properties and are often associated with specific reactions or properties. For example, the Mu value of C[C@H](O)[C@H]1[C@H]2C(=O)C[N@@H+]12 is higher than that of C[C@H](C=O)n1cncn1 because the former has a carbonyl group (-C=O), which is a functional group that is highly reactive and can participate in various chemical reactions.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is determined by the number of atoms in the molecule and their atomic weights. The Mu value of a molecule increases as the molecular weight increases. For example, the Mu value of C#CCC[C@@H](C#C)C#N is higher than that of CC(C)[N@H+]1C[C@H]1C=O because the molecular weight of the former is greater than the latter.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the electronegativity of the atoms in the molecule. The more electronegative atoms in a molecule, the greater its Mu value. For example, the Mu value of C[C@@H](OCCO)C(N)=O is higher than that of C#CC1=C(C)CC[C@@H]1C because the oxygen atom in the former has a higher electronegativity than the carbon atom in the latter.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. The Mu value of a molecule can be increased or decreased by the presence of functional groups that have high or low electronegativities, respectively. For example, the Mu value of C1CC2(C1)[C@@H]1CC[C@@H]12 is lower than that of C[C@H]1O[C@@H](C)C2(CC2)O1 because the oxygen atom in the former has a lower electronegativity than the carbon atom in the latter.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is the sum of the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule. The Mu value of a molecule increases as its molecular weight increases. For example, the Mu value of carbon dioxide (CO2) is higher than that of carbon monoxide (CO) because CO2 has a higher molecular weight.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the electronegativity of the atoms in the molecule. The more electronegative an atom is, the more it attracts electrons and the less it contributes to the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of carbon dioxide (CO2) is higher than that of carbon monoxide (CO) because the oxygen atoms in CO2 have a higher electronegativity than those in CO.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also affected by the number and position of functional groups present in the molecule. The presence of functional groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids can significantly increase or decrease the Mu value of a molecule. For example, the Mu value of ethanol (C2H5OH) is lower than that of methanol (CH3OH) because the hydroxyl group in ethanol has a lower electronegativity than the methyl group in methanol.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the higher the Mu value. For example, in the given data, the Mu value of the first molecule (O=C(CO)[C@H]1CO1) is 2.7472, which is higher than the Mu value of the second molecule (OCCC[C@H]1CC[C@H]1O) at 1.6082. Similarly, the Mu value of the third molecule (CC[C@@H](C)[C@@]1(C#N)CN1) is 4.9739, which is higher than the Mu value of the fourth molecule (CC[C@H]1C23OC12[C@@]31CN1) at 2.6065.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of atoms in the molecule and the electronegativity of the atoms. The more electronegative the atoms, the higher the Mu value. For example, in the given data, the Mu value of the fifth molecule (Cc1nc(O)c(N)o1) is 1.9320, which is lower than the Mu value of the sixth molecule (O=C[C@@H]1C=CCC[C@@H]1O) at 2.9941. Similarly, the Mu value of the seventh molecule (C#CCCn1ccnc1) is 3.3723, which is higher than the Mu value of the eighth molecule (C[C@H]1C=C2[C@@H](C)C[C@H]2O1) at 1.4846.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. The presence of functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and amides can increase or decrease the Mu value of a molecule. For example, the Mu value of the ninth molecule (Cc1cc(N)[nH]c1CO) is 1.7038, which is lower than the Mu value of the tenth molecule (C1=C[C@@H]2O[C@H](C1)[C@]21CO1) at 2.8714. Similarly, the Mu value of the eleventh

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of CN(C)C(=O)[C@@H](O)CO is 3.5528, which is higher than the Mu value of OCC[C@H]1[C@H]2[C@@H]3C[C@H]2[C@H]13 (1.3311).
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of atoms in the molecule and the electronegativity of the atoms. The more electronegative atoms present in the molecule, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of COc1coc(=O)n1C is 4.9919, which is higher than the Mu value of O=C1NC=CC1NO (3.4969).
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. The Mu value of a molecule with a functional group is generally higher than the Mu value of a molecule without a functional group. For example, the Mu value of C#CCCC[C@H](N)C#N is 2.2395, which is higher than the Mu value of O=C1C[C@@]2(CN2)[C@H]1CO (2.2955).

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of OCC[C@H]1C[C@H]1CO is 0.9156, which is lower than the Mu value of N#Cc1cc2n(c1)CC2 (7.1288), but higher than the Mu value of C1=C[C@@]2(C3CC3)O[C@H]2C1 (1.8058).
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and position of functional groups present in the molecule. The presence of polar functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH2), and carbonyl (-C=O) groups can increase the Mu value of a molecule, while the presence of nonpolar functional groups such as methyl (-CH3) and ethyl (-CH2CH3) groups can decrease the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of C[C@H]1C=C(C#N)C[N@@H+]1C is higher than the Mu value of C[C@H]1C=C(C#N)C[NH2+][C@@H]12, which has a polar amino group instead of a nonpolar hydrogen atom.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also affected by the hybridization state of the carbon atoms in the molecule. The Mu value of a molecule increases as the carbon atoms become more sp3 hybridized. For example, the Mu value of C[C@H]1C=C(C#N)C[N@@H+]1C is higher than the Mu value of C[C@H]1C=C(C#N)C[NH2+][C@@H]12, which has a carbon atom with a hybrid state of sp2 instead of sp3.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of carbon dioxide (CO2) is 3.7994, while the Mu value of methane (CH4) is 1.8060.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and type of functional groups present in the molecule. The presence of polar functional groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones can increase the Mu value, while the presence of nonpolar functional groups such as alkanes and alkenes can decrease the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of ethanol (C2H5OH) is 4.8168, while the Mu value of ethane (C2H6) is 0.1804.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also affected by the arrangement of atoms in the molecule. The Mu value can vary depending on whether the molecule is linear, branched, or cyclic. For example, the Mu value of cyclopropane (C3H6) is 0.5763, while the Mu value of butane (C4H10) is 0.3057. Additionally, the Mu value can also vary depending on the position of functional groups within the molecule.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is calculated by adding the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule. The Mu value is usually expressed in daltons (Da) or atomic mass units (amu). For example, the Mu value of the molecule OC[C@]12C[C@@H]3N[C@H]1[C@@H]3O2 is 1.0573 Da, which is equal to the sum of the atomic weights of oxygen (15.9994 Da), carbon (12.0107 Da), nitrogen (14.0063 Da), and hydrogen (1.0080 Da).
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and type of functional groups present in the molecule. Functional groups are chemical groups that have specific chemical properties and can affect the reactivity and behavior of a molecule. For example, the Mu value of the molecule Cc1cc(C)c(C=O)[nH]1 is 3.2059 Da, which is higher than the Mu value of the molecule C[C@H]1[C@@H](O)[C@H]2[NH2+][CH+]O[C@@H]12 (1.9517 Da) because the former has a carbonyl group (C=O), which is a polar functional group that increases the polarity and polarity surface area of the molecule. Similarly, the Mu value of the molecule C[C@H]1C(=O)N[C@H]1C=O is 3.8327 Da, which is higher than the Mu value of the molecule O=C[C@H]1[C@H]2C[N@@H+]1[C@H]2C=O (2.2965 Da) because the former has a double bond between carbon and oxygen, which is a polar functional group that increases the polarity and polarity surface area of the molecule.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also affected by the arrangement and conformation of the molecule. The conformation of a molecule refers to the way the atoms are arranged in space, and it can affect the polarity, polarity surface area, and other physical and chemical properties of the molecule

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of carbon dioxide (CO2) is 1.841900, while the Mu value of methane (CH4) is 1.664800.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and type of functional groups present in the molecule. The presence of polar functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH2), and carbonyl (-C=O) groups can increase the Mu value of a molecule, while the presence of nonpolar functional groups such as methyl (-CH3) and fluorine (-F) groups can decrease the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of ethanol (C2H5OH) is 2.617600, while the Mu value of methanol (CH3OH) is 3.273800.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also affected by the arrangement of atoms in the molecule. The Mu value of a linear molecule is generally lower than that of a branched molecule. For example, the Mu value of ethane (C2H6) is 2.754200, while the Mu value of propane (C3H8) is 3.655500. Additionally, the Mu value of a cyclic molecule is generally higher than that of a linear or branched molecule. For example, the Mu value of cyclopropane (C3H6) is 4.330100, while the Mu value of butane (C4H10) is 2.514100.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is determined by the number of atoms in the molecule and their atomic weights. The Mu value of a molecule increases as the molecular weight increases. For example, the Mu value of ethane (C2H6) is 4.355800, while the Mu value of propane (C3H8) is 5.944200.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the electronegativity of the atoms in the molecule. The more electronegative atoms in a molecule, the greater its Mu value. For example, the Mu value of carbon dioxide (CO2) is 2.776200, while the Mu value of carbon monoxide (CO) is 1.348200.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. Functional groups are chemical groups that have specific chemical properties and can affect the Mu value of a molecule. For example, the Mu value of ethanol (C2H5OH) is 4.879200, while the Mu value of methanol (CH3OH) is 3.827500.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of CO[C@@]12CO[C@@H](CO1)C2 is 0.194700, which is lower than the Mu value of CC(=O)OC[C@@H](C)CO, which is 1.242800. This is because the molecular weight of the first molecule is lower than the second molecule.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of hydrogen atoms present in the molecule. The more hydrogen atoms present, the lower the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of c1nc(OC2CC2)n[nH]1 is 2.971600, which is lower than the Mu value of C[C@]12N[C@@H]3[C@H]1OCO[C@@H]32, which is 1.074500. This is because the first molecule has one more hydrogen atom than the second molecule.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. The Mu value can be affected positively or negatively by the presence of functional groups. For example, the Mu value of CCC[C@H]1C[C@H]1NC=O is 3.422300, which is higher than the Mu value of O=c1cc[nH]nc1, which is 5.301100. This is because the first molecule has a carbonyl group (-C=O), which increases the Mu value. However, the Mu value of C[C@]12C[C@H](C1)[C@H]1[C@@H](O)[C@H]12 is 1.418700, which is lower than the Mu value of CO[C@@H](C)[C@H]1[C@@H](C)[N@H+]1C, which is 1.880000. This is because the first molecule has a hydroxyl group (-OH), which decreases the Mu value.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its electronegativity. The more electronegative the atoms in a molecule, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of carbon is 2.55, while the Mu value of nitrogen is 3.04. Therefore, the Mu value of a molecule increases as the electronegativity difference between the atoms increases.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of bonds between the atoms. The more bonds a molecule has, the lower the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of methane (CH4) is 1.40, while the Mu value of ethane (C2H6) is 1.00. Therefore, the Mu value of a molecule decreases as the number of bonds between the atoms increases.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is affected by the presence of functional groups. Functional groups are chemical groups that have specific chemical properties and can affect the Mu value of a molecule. For example, the Mu value of a molecule containing a carbonyl group (C=O) is generally higher than that of a molecule without a carbonyl group. Similarly, the Mu value of a molecule containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) is generally lower than that of a molecule without a hydroxyl group. Therefore, the Mu value of a molecule can be used to identify functional groups and predict their chemical behavior.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is the sum of the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule. The Mu value of a molecule increases as its molecular weight increases. For example, the Mu value of carbon dioxide (CO2) is higher than that of carbon monoxide (CO) because the molecular weight of CO2 is greater than that of CO.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and type of functional groups present in the molecule. Functional groups are chemical groups that have specific chemical properties and can affect the physical and chemical properties of a molecule. For example, the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a molecule can increase its Mu value compared to a molecule without this group. Similarly, the presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) in a molecule can decrease its Mu value compared to a molecule without this group.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also affected by the arrangement of atoms in the molecule. The Mu value of a molecule can vary depending on whether it is linear, branched, cyclic, or acyclic. For example, the Mu value of ethane (C2H6) is lower than that of propane (C3H8) because the former has a linear structure while the latter has a branched structure. Additionally, the Mu value of a molecule can also vary depending on the position of functional groups within the molecule. For example, the Mu value of ethanol (CH3CH2OH) is higher than that of methanol (CH3OH) because the hydroxyl group is located at the end of the molecule in the former, while it is located in the middle of the molecule in the latter.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is determined by the number of atoms in the molecule and their atomic weights. The Mu value of a molecule increases as the molecular weight increases. For example, the Mu values of the molecules listed in the data are in the order of increasing molecular weight: O=C1O[C@@H]2[C@H]3O[C@@H]2[C@@]13O (1.355900), CC[C@H]1CN=COCO1 (1.688000), C#C[C@]1([C@@H](C)C#N)CO1 (3.989200), O=C1[C@H]2CO[C@@]13CC[C@@H]23 (2.815700), C[C@@H]1C[C@@H]2O[C@H]1C[C@@H]2C (1.435600), C1=NCC2[NH2+][C@@H]3C[C@@H]3N12 (2.707700), CO[C@@H](CC=O)[C@H]1CN1 (2.445800), CC1=C[C@H]2C[C@H](O2)[C@@H]1C (1.755500), CC1(C)[C@H]2O[C@H]2[C@@]12CO2 (0.660300), CCCOC(N)=O (2.462000), O[C@H]1[C@@H]2[C@H]3C=C[C@@H]2[C@]31O (2.007900), CO[C@@H]1[C@H](O)C[C@@H]1OC (1.949000), C[C@]12CCOC[C@H]1[C@H]2O (2.38

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is the sum of the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule. The Mu value of a molecule increases as its molecular weight increases. For example, the Mu values of the molecules listed in the data are in the order of C#C[C@@H]1C[C@@H]1C(F)(F)F < O=C1C[C@]2(O1)[C@H](O)[C@@H]2O < NC(=O)Oc1nnon1 < CC1([C@@H]2C=CCO2)CC1 < OCc1nc2n(n1)CC2 < C[C@H]1O[C@H]1CC#CC=O < C1=NCCN=C2CCN12 < Nc1cc(C2CC2)co1 < [NH-]C1O[C@H]2C(=O)[C@@H]1[C@H]2O < [NH-]C1O[C@H]2C[C@]1(O)C2 < Nc1cc(=O)nc[nH]1 < COC(=O)NC(C)=O < CC1=C[C@H]2C=CC[C@@H]1C2 < CC(C)C#CC=O < Cc1ccc([C@@H](C)O)[nH]1 < C[C@@]12C[C@H]3CC[C@@H]1O[C@H]32 < c1cnc2[nH]cnc2c1 < O=CO[C@@]12CC(=O)[C@@H]1C2 < C/N=C(/NC=O)C(C)C < C[C@@H]1C(=O)CCN1C=O < OC[C@@]1([C@H]2CO2)CN1 < O=C1O[C@@H]2C[C@@]1(O)[C

================================

Similarly, the Mu value of a molecule with a hydroxyl group (-OH) is lower than that of a molecule without a hydroxyl group.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also affected by the arrangement of atoms in the molecule. The Mu value of a linear molecule is generally higher than that of a bent molecule, as the bond angles in a bent molecule are smaller and therefore the electrons are more localized. Additionally, the Mu value of a molecule can be affected by the presence of lone pairs of electrons on atoms, as these electrons can affect the electron density around the molecule and therefore the Mu value.

================================

For example, the Mu value of oxygen (O) is 34.06 Da, while the Mu value of fluorine (F) is 39.99 Da.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule can also be affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. Functional groups are chemical groups that have specific chemical properties and are responsible for the reactivity of the molecule. For example, the Mu value of ethanol (C2H5OH) is 46.06 Da, while the Mu value of methanol (CH3OH) is 32.05 Da. The difference in Mu value between these two molecules is due to the presence of the hydroxyl group (-OH) in ethanol, which has a higher electronegativity than the methyl group (-CH3) in methanol.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is calculated by adding up the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of CNC(C#N)(C#N)C#N is 3.9021, which is higher than the Mu value of N#CC[N@@H+]1C[C@H]2CC[C@H]21 (4.4976).
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the number of carbon atoms in the molecule. The more carbon atoms in the molecule, the lower the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of CCCCC[C@H]1CC([NH-])O1 (2.8958) is lower than the Mu value of COC(=O)[C@@]1(CO)CN1 (3.5532).

For example, the Mu value of nitrogen (N2) is 7.994 Da, while the Mu value of oxygen (O2) is 3.44 Da.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule can also be affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. Functional groups are chemical groups that have specific chemical properties and are responsible for the reactivity of the molecule. For example, the Mu value of ethanol (C2H5OH) is 46.07 Da, while the Mu value of methanol (CH3OH) is 32.05 Da. This difference in Mu value is due to the presence of the hydroxyl group (-OH) in ethanol, which has a higher electronegativity than the methyl group (-CH3) in methanol.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is the sum of the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule. The Mu value is usually expressed in units of daltons (Da). For example, the Mu value of COC(=O)NCCO is 2.5404 Da, which is equal to the molecular weight of the molecule.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the electronegativity of the atoms in the molecule. The more electronegative an atom is, the greater its ability to attract electrons towards itself, and the lower its electron density. This can result in a higher Mu value for a molecule containing more electronegative atoms. For example, the Mu value of COC[C@@H](C)NC(C)=O is 3.7990 Da, which is higher than the Mu value of COC(=O)NCCO due to the presence of the highly electronegative carbon atom in the latter.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule can also be affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. Functional groups are chemical groups that have specific chemical properties and are responsible for the reactivity of the molecule. Different functional groups have different Mu values, and the presence of certain functional groups can increase or decrease the Mu value of the molecule. For example, the Mu value of N#CC1OCCO1 is 3.6235 Da, which is higher than the Mu value of COC(=O)NCCO due to the presence of the nitro group (-NO2) in the former.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of carbon dioxide (CO2) is 3.286900, which is higher than that of methane (CH4), which is 1.817900.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and type of functional groups present in the molecule. The presence of polar functional groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids can increase the Mu value of a molecule, while the presence of nonpolar functional groups such as alkanes and alkenes can decrease it. For example, the Mu value of ethanol (C2H5OH) is 2.657300, which is higher than that of ethane (C2H6), which is 0.050400.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also affected by the arrangement of atoms in the molecule. The Mu value of a molecule can vary depending on whether it is linear, branched, or cyclic. For example, the Mu value of cyclopropane (C3H6) is 0.212000, which is lower than that of propane (C3H8), which is 0.590900. Additionally, the Mu value of a molecule can also be influenced by the hybridization of the carbon atom. For example, the Mu value of ethylene (C2H4) is 2.369100, which is higher than that of ethane, due to the presence of double bonds between the carbon atoms.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is determined by the number of atoms in the molecule and their atomic weights. The Mu value of a molecule increases as the molecular weight increases.

3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule can also be affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. Functional groups are chemical groups that have specific chemical properties and are often associated with specific reactions or properties. The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule can increase or decrease its Mu value. For example, the Mu value of C[C@H]1C[C@H]1C1=NCCO1 (0.9344) is lower than the Mu value of CC(C#N)(C#N)C(N)=O (2.8880) because the former molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), which has a higher electronegativity than the carbon atom in the latter molecule.

================================

2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the electronegativity of the atoms in the molecule. The more electronegative an atom is, the greater its ability to attract electrons towards itself, and the lower its electron density. This means that the Mu value will be higher for molecules with more electronegative atoms. For example, the Mu value of N#C[C@H](N)[C@H]1[C@H]2C[N@@H+]1C2 is 4.3166 Da, which is higher than the Mu value of COC[C@]12C[C@](O)(C1)C2 (2.047 Da).
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule can also be affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. Functional groups are chemical groups that have specific chemical properties and are responsible for the reactivity of the molecule. For example, the Mu value of C[C@H]1CC([NH-])N1C(N)=O is 1.5570 Da, which is higher than the Mu value of O=C1CC(CO)(CO)O1 (2.2354 Da). This is because the [NH-] group has a higher electronegativity than the [O=C=O] group, which means that it attracts electrons more strongly and has a higher electron density.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of carbon dioxide (CO2) is 3.459900, while the Mu value of methane (CH4) is 1.804600.

Additionally, the Mu value of a molecule can be affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. The more functional groups present in the molecule, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of methanol (CH3OH) is 1.150700, while the Mu value of ethanol (C2H5OH) is 1.231300.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is determined by the number of atoms in the molecule and their atomic weights. The Mu value can be calculated by multiplying the molecular weight by 1.602 × 10^-24. For example, the Mu value of ethane (C2H6) is 78.138 g/mol, which is equal to 1.602 × 10^-24 multiplied by the molecular weight of ethane (44.076 g/mol). Therefore, the Mu value of ethane is 1.104 × 10^-23.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the electronegativity of the atoms in the molecule. The more electronegative atoms in the molecule, the greater the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of carbon dioxide (CO2) is higher than that of carbon monoxide (CO) because the oxygen atom in CO2 has a higher electronegativity than the oxygen atom in CO. Similarly, the Mu value of ammonia (NH3) is higher than that of nitrogen (N2) because the nitrogen atom in NH3 has a higher electronegativity than the nitrogen atom in N2.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also affected by the bond angles and bond lengths between the atoms in the molecule. The more bent or linear the bonds in the molecule, the lower the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of ethylene (C2H4) is lower than that of ethane (C2H6) because the C-C-C angle in ethylene is more bent (120 degrees) than the C-C-C angle in ethane (180 degrees). Similarly, the Mu value of methane (CH4) is lower than that of ethane (C2H6) because the C-H bonds in methane are shorter and more linear than the C-C bonds in ethane.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is determined by the number of atoms in the molecule and their atomic weights.

2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the electronegativity of the atoms in the molecule. The more electronegative atoms in a molecule, the greater its Mu value. For example, the Mu value of carbon dioxide (CO2) is 2.761900, while the Mu value of carbon monoxide (CO) is 2.222900.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. The Mu value of a molecule can increase or decrease depending on the type and position of the functional group. For example, the Mu value of formaldehyde (CH2O) is 2.465500, while the Mu value of methanol (CH3OH) is 3.023600.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of carbon dioxide (CO2) is 3.614500, while the Mu value of methane (CH4) is 1.804500.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and type of atoms present in the molecule. The more atoms present in a molecule, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of ethane (C2H6) is 3.944500, while the Mu value of propane (C3H8) is 4.044500. Additionally, the Mu value of a molecule can be affected by the electronegativity of the atoms present in the molecule. The more electronegative atoms present in a molecule, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of fluorine (F) is 3.998400, while the Mu value of chlorine (Cl) is 3.163300.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule can also be influenced by the bond angles and lengths present in the molecule. The more bent or linear bonds present in a molecule, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of ethylene (C2H4) is 3.944500, while the Mu value of acetylene (C2H2) is 3.000000. Additionally, the Mu value of a molecule can be affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. The more functional groups present in a molecule, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of methanol (CH3OH) is 4.534900, while the Mu value of ethanol (C2H5OH) is 4.950000.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is calculated by adding the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule. The Mu value is usually expressed in units of daltons (Da). For example, the Mu value of CNc1[nH]cnc1O is 1.931200 Da, which is equal to the sum of the atomic weights of carbon (12.0108 Da), nitrogen (7.6743 Da), and hydrogen (1.0080 Da).
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and type of functional groups present in the molecule. Functional groups are chemical groups that have specific chemical properties and can affect the reactivity and behavior of a molecule. For example, the Mu value of C#C[C@]1(C#N)N[C@@H]1C=O is 2.232300 Da, which is higher than the Mu value of CNc1[nH]cnc1O due to the presence of the carbonyl group (C=O). Similarly, the Mu value of CCC[C@H]1[C@@H](O)[C@H]2C[N@H+]21 is 1.771700 Da, which is lower than the Mu value of CNc1[nH]cnc1O due to the absence of the nitrogen atom.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also affected by the arrangement of atoms in the molecule. The Mu value of a linear molecule is generally higher than the Mu value of a cyclic molecule due to the lack of ring strain. For example, the Mu value of O=CC1CCCCCC1 is 2.977400 Da, which is higher than the Mu value of CCC[C@H](O)CC(C)=O (3.507300 Da). Additionally, the Mu value of a molecule can also be affected by the presence of lone pairs of electrons on atoms, as in the case of the Mu value of CO[C@H]1C[C@H]2C[C@H]2[C@H]1C (1.153700 Da), which is lower than the Mu value of

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is the sum of the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule. The Mu value is usually expressed in units of daltons (Da). For example, the Mu value of carbon dioxide (CO2) is 3.995 Da, while the Mu value of methane (CH4) is 16.04 Da.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the electronegativity difference between the atoms in the molecule. The greater the electronegativity difference, the greater the dipole moment and the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of nitrous oxide (N2O) is 4.01 Da, while the Mu value of carbon monoxide (CO) is 1.69 Da.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. Functional groups are chemical groups that have specific chemical properties and can affect the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of ethanol (C2H5OH) is 4.99 Da, while the Mu value of methanol (CH3OH) is 3.99 Da.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is determined by the number of atoms in the molecule and their atomic weights. The more atoms in a molecule, the higher its molecular weight, and therefore, the higher its Mu value.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the electronegativity of the atoms in the molecule. The more electronegative an atom is, the more it attracts electrons towards itself, and the more stable the molecule becomes. Therefore, molecules with more electronegative atoms tend to have higher Mu values.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. Functional groups are chemical groups that have specific chemical properties and can affect the physical and chemical properties of a molecule. For example, the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a molecule can increase its Mu value due to the high electronegativity of oxygen. Similarly, the presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule can decrease its Mu value due to the low electronegativity of nitrogen.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is determined by the number of atoms in the molecule and their atomic weights. The Mu value of a molecule increases as the molecular weight increases. For example, the Mu value of NH3 (molecular weight = 17) is 2.66, while the Mu value of CH4 (molecular weight = 16) is 1.65.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the electronegativity of the atoms in the molecule. The more electronegative the atoms, the higher the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of CO (electronegativity difference between carbon and oxygen = 0.44) is 1.65, while the Mu value of NO (electronegativity difference = 0.50) is 2.05.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is affected by the presence of functional groups in the molecule. Functional groups are chemical groups that have specific chemical properties and can affect the Mu value of a molecule. For example, the Mu value of a molecule with a carbonyl group (-C=O) is generally higher than that of a molecule without a carbonyl group. The Mu value of formaldehyde (CH2O) is 3.96, while the Mu value of acetone (CH3COCH3) is 4.18.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is the sum of the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule. The Mu value of a molecule increases as its molecular weight increases. For example, the Mu values of the molecules N#Cc1ccncc1F, ONC1CNC1, CNCC(C)(C#N)C#N, C[C@@]12C[C@H]3C[C@@H](C1)[C@]32O, CC(C)(C)[C@H]1C[C@H]2C[N@H+]21, C[C@H]1[C@@H](O)C[C@H]1NC=O, C[C@@H](O)[C@@]1(CO)CO1, NC(=O)N[C@H]1C[C@@H](O)C1, C[C@]12C[C@H](C1)[C@H]1C[C@H]12, CC1(C)C(=O)[C@@]2(C)N[C@@H]12, CC#C[C@@H]1C(=O)C[C@@H]1O, C#CCO[C@H]1C[NH2+][CH+]O1, C[C@]12N[C@H]1[C@@]1(C)N[C@@H]21, C/C(=N\O)C1(C)CCC1, OCc1cnn2c1CC2, C#CC(C#C)(C=O)OC, C[C@]1(O)C[C@@](C)(O)C1=O, O=CC1(C=O)CC(=O)O1, Cn1cnc(O)c1C#N, CNC(=O)[C@H]1[C@H]2C[C@@H]1C2, CC1=C(C)[C@@H]2[C@@H]3C[C@H]1[N@H+]23, CC1=CC[C@@H](C=O)

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is the sum of the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule. The Mu value of a molecule increases as its molecular weight increases. For example, the Mu value of carbon dioxide (CO2) is higher than that of methane (CH4) because CO2 has a higher molecular weight.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and type of functional groups present in the molecule. Functional groups are chemical groups that have specific chemical properties and can affect the Mu value of a molecule. For example, the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a molecule can increase its Mu value, while the presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) can decrease it.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule can also be affected by the arrangement of atoms in the molecule. The Mu value of a molecule can vary depending on whether it is linear, branched, or cyclic. For example, the Mu value of ethane (C2H6) is higher than that of propane (C3H8) because ethane is a linear molecule, while propane is a branched molecule. Additionally, the Mu value of a molecule can be affected by the position of functional groups within the molecule. For example, the Mu value of a molecule with two carbonyl groups on opposite sides of the molecule will be lower than that of a molecule with one carbonyl group on each side.

================================

1. Rule 1: The Mu value of a molecule is directly related to its molecular weight, which is calculated by adding the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule. The Mu value is usually expressed in daltons (Da) or atomic mass units (amu). For example, the Mu value of carbon dioxide (CO2) is 32.03 Da, while the Mu value of methane (CH4) is 16.04 Da.
2. Rule 2: The Mu value of a molecule is also influenced by the number and type of functional groups present in the molecule. Functional groups are chemical groups that have specific chemical properties and can affect the Mu value. For example, the Mu value of a molecule with a carbonyl group (C=O) is generally higher than that of a molecule without a carbonyl group. Similarly, the Mu value of a molecule with a nitro group (-NO2) is lower than that of a molecule without a nitro group.
3. Rule 3: The Mu value of a molecule is also affected by the arrangement of atoms in the molecule. The Mu value of a linear molecule is generally higher than that of a bent molecule. For example, the Mu value of ethane (C2H6) is 30.03 Da, while the Mu value of ethylene (C2H4) is 28.02 Da. Additionally, the Mu value of a molecule can also be affected by the presence of isotopes, such as hydrogen isotopes (protium and deuterium), which have different atomic masses.
