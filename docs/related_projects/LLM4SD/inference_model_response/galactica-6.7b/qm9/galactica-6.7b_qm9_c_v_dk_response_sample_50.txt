1. Rule of Thumb: The higher the number of carbon atoms in a molecule, the higher its Cv value.
2. Rule of Thumb: The presence of double bonds or triple bonds between carbon atoms increases the Cv value of a molecule.
3. Rule of Thumb: The presence of functional groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, or carboxylic acids in a molecule also increases its Cv value.
For example, the Cv value of the molecule O=c1oc(F)cnc1F is 24.221001, which is lower than the Cv values of the other molecules listed in the table. This is because it has only one carbon atom, while the other molecules have two or more carbon atoms. Similarly, the presence of double bonds or triple bonds between carbon atoms in the molecules CCCC[C@H]1C[C@H]1O and CCCC#CCCO increases their Cv values compared to the molecule CCCc1coc(=O)[nH]1, which has only one double bond. Finally, the presence of functional groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, or carboxylic acids in the molecules CO[C@@H]1[C@H](C#N)[C@@H]1C=O and C[C@H]1C[C@@H](C)[C@]2(CO2)C1 increases their Cv values compared to the molecule CCCc1coc(=O)[nH]1.

2. Rule 2: The presence of double bonds or triple bonds in a molecule directly relates to its Cv value. The more double bonds or triple bonds a molecule has, the higher its Cv value will be. For example, the Cv value of ethylene (C2H4) is 40.4 J/g, while the Cv value of acetylene (C2H2) is 41.2 J/g.
3. Rule 3: The presence of polar bonds in a molecule directly relates to its Cv value. The more polar bonds a molecule has, the higher its Cv value will be. For example, the Cv value of water (H2O) is 40.5 J/g, while the Cv value of ammonia (NH3) is 41.6 J/g.

1. Rule 1: The number of carbon atoms in a molecule directly relates to its Cv value. The more carbon atoms a molecule has, the higher its Cv value will be. For example, the Cv value of ethane (C2H6) is 39.22 J/g, while the Cv value of propane (C3H8) is 41.63 J/g.
2. Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids can significantly impact the Cv value of a molecule. For instance, the Cv value of ethanol (C2H5OH) is 28.49 J/g, while the Cv value of butan-2-ol (C4H10O) is 31.62 J/g. Similarly, the Cv value of propanal (CH3CHO) is 29.22 J/g, while the Cv value of butyraldehyde (C4H6O) is 32.22 J/g.
3. Rule 3: The arrangement of atoms in a molecule can also affect its Cv value. For example, the Cv value of cyclobutanone (C4H6O) is 29.86 J/g, while the Cv value of cyclopentanone (C5H8O) is 30.51 J/g. Additionally, the Cv value of 1,2-propanediol (C3H8O2) is 32.09 J/g, while the Cv value of 1,3-propanediol (C3H8O2) is 33.09 J/g.
