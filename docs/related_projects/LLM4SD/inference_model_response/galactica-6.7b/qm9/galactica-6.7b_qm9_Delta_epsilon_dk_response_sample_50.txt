Rule 1: The HOMO-LUMO gap value of a molecule is directly related to its electronic structure, specifically the number of electrons in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). A larger HOMO-LUMO gap indicates a higher energy difference between the two orbitals, which means that the molecule is more stable and less reactive.
2. Rule 2: The HOMO-LUMO gap value of a molecule is also influenced by the electronegativity and size of the atoms in the molecule. Atoms with higher electronegativity or smaller size tend to have lower LUMO energies and higher HOMO energies, resulting in a larger HOMO-LUMO gap.
3. Rule 3: The HOMO-LUMO gap value of a molecule can also be affected by the presence of functional groups or substituents in the molecule. For example, adding electron-donating groups such as hydroxyl or amino groups to a molecule can increase the HOMO energy and decrease the LUMO energy, leading to a larger HOMO-LUMO gap. On the other hand, adding electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyl or halogen groups can have the opposite effect.
