Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict if it can be inhibit HIV replication:

A low molecular weight indicates that the molecule has fewer atoms and is more easily transported through biological membranes. A polar surface area indicates that the molecule has a high number of polar groups, which can interact with water molecules and increase its solubility in aqueous solutions.
3. Rule 3: The molecule should have a specific functional group that can interact with the HIV enzyme. The functional group should be present in the molecule and should have a specific structure that allows it to bind to the HIV enzyme. This functional group may be a nitrogen-containing group such as a guanidine or a sulfonamide group.
