For example, all the molecules in the dataset have a carbonyl group (C=O), which is known to be important for BACE-1 inhibition. Additionally, the presence of fluorine atoms in the molecules can increase their lipophilicity and polarity, which can enhance their ability to penetrate the cell membrane and interact with the target enzyme. Finally, the presence of a polar functional group such as an amino group (-NH2) or hydroxyl group (-OH) in the molecule can improve its binding affinity to the target enzyme and enhance its inhibitory activity.

Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict if it can be inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1):
1. Rule 1: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule is essential for inhibiting human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
2. Rule 2: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the molecule is important for inhibiting human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
3. Rule 3: The length and flexibility of the molecule are also important factors in determining its ability to inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
These rules can be inferred from the given data by analyzing the structures and labels of the molecules. For example, all the molecules with a nitrogen atom (such as compounds 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) have a label of 1, indicating that they can inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1). Similarly, all the molecules with a carbonyl group (such as compounds 2, 3, 9, and 10) have a label of 1, indicating that they can inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1). Additionally, the longer and more flexible the molecule, the greater its potential to inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1) (compounds 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8).
