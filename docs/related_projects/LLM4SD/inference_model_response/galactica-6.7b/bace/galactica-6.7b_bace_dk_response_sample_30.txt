Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict if it can be inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1):
1. Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the molecule is essential for inhibiting human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
2. Rule 2: The presence of a hydrophobic group such as a phenyl ring or a long chain hydrocarbon in the molecule enhances its ability to inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
3. Rule 3: The presence of a polar group such as an amino group (-NH2) in the molecule reduces its ability to inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
These rules can be inferred from the given data by analyzing the structures and labels of the molecules. For example, all the molecules with a carbonyl group (C=O) have a label of 1, indicating that they can inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1). Similarly, all the molecules with a hydrophobic group such as a phenyl ring or a long chain hydrocarbon have a label of 1, while all the molecules with a polar group such as an amino group (-NH2) have a label of 0, indicating that they cannot inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).

Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict if it can be inhibit human β-secretase 1(BACE-1):
1. Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the molecule is essential for inhibiting human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
2. Rule 2: The molecule should have a polar functional group such as an amino group (-NH2) or hydroxyl group (-OH) near the carbonyl group to enhance its inhibitory activity.
3. Rule 3: The molecule should have a hydrophobic tail at the end of the molecule to facilitate its binding to the active site of human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).
These rules can be inferred from the given data by analyzing the structures and properties of the molecules. For example, the first molecule has a carbonyl group (C=O) and a polar amino group (-NH2) near the carbonyl group, which suggests that it may have high affinity for the active site of human β-secretase 1(BACE-1). Similarly, the second molecule has a hydrophobic tail at the end of the molecule, which also supports its ability to bind to the active site of human β-secretase 1(BACE-1).

These rules can be inferred from the given data by analyzing the structures and labels of the molecules. For example, all four molecules with label 1 have a carbonyl group (C=O), while none of the molecules with label 0 have this group. Similarly, all four molecules with label 1 have a hydrophobic group such as a phenyl ring or a long chain hydrocarbon, while none of the molecules with label 0 have this group. Finally, all four molecules with label 1 have a polar functional group such as an amino group (-NH2) or a hydroxyl group (-OH), while none of the molecules with label 0 have this group.
