1. Rule 1: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, it is more likely to be BBBP.
2. Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group, it is less likely to be BBBP.
3. Rule 3: If the molecule contains a hydroxyl group, it is less likely to be BBBP.
Explanation:
- Rule 1: The benzene ring is a common structural feature in many BBBP molecules. For example, the molecule in label 1, "NCCC(O)CNC1CC(N)C(OC2OC(CN)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1OC3OC(CO)C(O)C(N)C3O", contains a benzene ring. Similarly, the molecule in label 2, "C1=CC=CC3=C1N(C2=C(C=CC=C2)S3)CC(N(CC)CC)C", also contains a benzene ring. Therefore, molecules that contain a benzene ring are more likely to be BBBP.
- Rule 2: The carbonyl group is a common functional group in non-BBBP molecules. For example, the molecule in label 0, "C1=CC=CC3=C1N(C2=C(C=CC=C2)S3)CC(N(CC)CC)C", does not contain a benzene ring, but it does contain a carbonyl group. Therefore, molecules that contain a carbonyl group are less likely to be BBBP.
- Rule 3: The hydroxyl group is a common functional
