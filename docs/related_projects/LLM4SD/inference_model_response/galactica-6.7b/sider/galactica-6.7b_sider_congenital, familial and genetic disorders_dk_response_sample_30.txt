1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, such as a sulfonamide group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, such as a nitro group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, such as a halogen group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
These rules are based on the observation that molecules containing these functional groups are more likely to cause adverse effects in humans. However, it is important to note that these rules are not foolproof and there may be exceptions to them. It is always best to consult with a qualified chemist before making any decisions based on these rules.

================================

1. Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: The presence of a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
