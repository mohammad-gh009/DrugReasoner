However, it is important to note that these rules are not always accurate and should be used with caution.

================================

1. Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as a carbonyl group (C=O) or a hydroxyl group (-OH), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogenated aromatic ring, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Explanation:
1. Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) or a hydroxyl group (-OH) in a molecule is often associated with adverse effects such as reproductive system and breast disorders. For example, the molecule in the smiles string with label 1, "CC(COC1=CC=CC=C1)NC(C)C(C2=CC=C(C=C2)O)O", contains a carbonyl group and is associated with adverse effects. Similarly, the molecule in the smiles string with label 0, "C(C=O)C(C=O)O", also contains a carbonyl group and is associated with adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: The presence of a halogenated aromatic ring in a molecule is also associated with adverse effects. For example, the molecule in the smiles string with label 1, "C1=CC(=CC=C1COC(CN2C=CN=C2)C3=C(C=C(C=C3)Cl)Cl)Cl", contains a halogenated aromatic ring and is associated with adverse effects. Similarly, the molecule in the smiles string with label 0, "C1C(C2=CC=CC=C2N(C3=CC=CC=C31)C(=O)N)O", also contains a halogenated aromatic ring and is associated with adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule is often associated with adverse effects. For example, the molecule in the smiles string with label 1, "CC(C(=O)NC1=C(C(=C(C(=C1I)C(=O)NC(CO)CO)I)C(=O)NC(CO)CO)I)C(=O)NC(CO)CO)O", contains a nitro group and is

1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as a carbonyl group (C=O) or a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogenated aromatic structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
These rules can be inferred from the given data as follows:
1. Rule 1: The first molecule (C1=CC=C(C=C1)COC2=CC=C(C=C2)O) contains a carbonyl group (C=O), which is known to be associated with reproductive system and breast disorders. Therefore, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: The second molecule (CNC(=C[N+](=O)[O-])NCCSCC1=CC=C(O1)CN(C)C) contains a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure, which is known to be associated with adverse effects. Therefore, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: The third molecule (CC12CCC3C(C1CCC(=O)O2)CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC34C) contains a halogenated aromatic structure, which is known to be associated with adverse effects. Therefore, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
