1. Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
These rules can be inferred from the provided data as follows:

Based on the provided data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:
1. Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
These rules can be inferred by analyzing the structures of the molecules and looking for the presence of specific functional groups that are known to be associated with adverse effects. For example, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule is known to be associated with toxicity and adverse effects. Similarly, the presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule are also known to be associated with adverse effects. Therefore, these rules can be used to predict whether a new molecule is likely to cause adverse effects based on its structure.

================================

1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, it is likely to cause adverse effects as well. For example, if a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it is known to cause adverse effects such as allergic reactions and skin rashes. Therefore, if a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it is likely to cause adverse effects as well.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to be toxic, it is likely to cause adverse effects as well. For example, if a molecule contains a benzene ring, it is known to be toxic and can cause adverse effects such as liver damage and cancer. Therefore, if a molecule contains a benzene ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects as well.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains multiple functional groups that are known to cause adverse effects, it is likely to cause adverse effects as well. For example, if a molecule contains both a sulfonamide group and a benzene ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects as well. Therefore, if a molecule contains both a sulfonamide group and a benzene ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects as well.
