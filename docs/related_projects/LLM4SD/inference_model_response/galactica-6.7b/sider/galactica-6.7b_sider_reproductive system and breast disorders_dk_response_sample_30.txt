================================

1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as a carbonyl group (C=O) or a hydroxyl group (-OH), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders.

================================

Based on the provided data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:
1. Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders.
2. Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders.
3. Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders.
These rules are based on the observation that the molecules with these functional groups are commonly associated with adverse effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders. However, it is important to note that these rules are not definitive and there may be other factors that contribute to the adverse effects of a molecule.
