Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders.
These rules can be inferred from the given data by analyzing the structures and labels of the molecules. For example, in the first data set, the molecule with label 1 (related to eye disorders) contains a halogen atom (fluorine) and a nitro group (-NO2), while the molecule with label 0 does not. Similarly, in the second data set, the molecule with label 1 contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), while the molecule with label 0 does not. Therefore, these three rules can be used to predict whether a new molecule is likely to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders based on its structure.

1. Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.

2. Rule 2: The presence of a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) in a molecule is also a significant indicator of its potential to cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: The number and position of functional groups in a molecule can also impact its potential to cause adverse effects. For example, a molecule with multiple carbonyl groups may be more likely to cause adverse effects than a molecule with a single carbonyl group. Similarly, a molecule with a halogen atom in a specific position may be more likely to cause adverse effects than a molecule with a halogen atom in a different position.
