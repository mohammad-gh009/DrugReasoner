1. Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
2. Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:
1. Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
2. Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
3. Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
These rules can be inferred from the given data as follows:
1. Rule 1: The molecule with label 1, CN1CCC[C@@H]1CC2=CNC3=C2C=C(C=C3)CCS(=O)(=O)C4=CC=CC=C4 1, contains a nitro group (-NO2).

Therefore, the presence of a nitro group in a molecule is likely to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
2. Rule 2: The molecule with label 1, C(C(F)(F)F)(OC(F)F)Cl 1, contains a halogen atom (chlorine). The molecule with label 0, CC1OC2=C(O1)C=C(C=C2)C(C)(C)C, does not contain a halogen atom. Therefore, the presence of a halogen atom in a molecule is likely to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
3. Rule 3: The molecule with label 1, CC1CCN(CC1N(C)C2=NC=NC3=C2C=CN3)C(=O)CC#N 0, contains a carbonyl group (-C=O).
