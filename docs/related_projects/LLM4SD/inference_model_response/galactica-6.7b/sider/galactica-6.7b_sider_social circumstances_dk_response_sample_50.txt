1. Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
These rules are based on the observation that the molecules with these functional groups are more likely to cause adverse effects than those without them. However, it is important to note that these rules are not definitive and there may be other factors that contribute to the adverse effects of a molecule.

================================

1. Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, such as a sulfonamide group, then it is likely to cause adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: If the molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, such as a nitro group, then it is likely to cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: If the molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, such as a halogen group, then it is likely to cause adverse effects.
These rules are based on the observation that molecules containing these functional groups are more likely to cause adverse effects than molecules without them. However, it is important to note that these rules are not foolproof and there may be exceptions to them. It is always best to consult with a qualified chemist before making any decisions based on these rules.

3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a polar functional group, such as an alcohol group or a carboxylic acid group, it is likely to cause adverse effects as well.
These rules are based on the assumption that molecules with these properties are more likely to interact with biological systems and cause adverse effects. However, it is important to note that these rules are not always accurate and should be used as a starting point for further research and analysis.
