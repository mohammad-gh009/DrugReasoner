================================

1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects such as injury, poisoning, or procedural complications, it is likely to cause adverse effects as well. For example, if a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it is known to cause adverse effects such as allergic reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Therefore, if a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, it is likely to cause adverse effects regardless of the molecule's structure. For example, if a molecule contains a nitro group, it is known to cause adverse effects such as methemoglobinemia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, if a molecule contains a nitro group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains multiple functional groups that are known to cause adverse effects, it is likely to cause adverse effects as well. For example, if a molecule contains both a sulfonamide group and a nitro group, it is likely to cause adverse effects as well. Therefore, if a molecule contains both a sulfonamide group and a nitro group, it is likely to cause adverse effects.

================================

Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:
1. Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects such as injury, poisoning, or procedural complications, then it is likely to cause adverse effects as well. For example, if the molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it is known to cause adverse effects such as allergic reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Therefore, if a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it is likely to cause adverse effects as well.
2. Rule 2: If the molecule contains a functional group that is known to be toxic, then it is likely to cause adverse effects as well. For example, if the molecule contains a nitro group, it is known to be toxic and can cause adverse effects such as methemoglobinemia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, if a molecule contains a nitro group, it is likely to cause adverse effects as well.

3. Rule 3: The molecule with the structure "CNC(=C[N+](=O)[O-])NCCSCC1=CC=C(O1)CN(C)C" contains a tertiary amine group (-N(CH3)3+). Therefore, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to injury, poisoning, and procedural complications.

================================

1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group that is highly reactive and can form covalent bonds with other molecules, it is more likely to cause adverse effects. For example, if a molecule contains a hydroxyl group (-OH), it is highly reactive and can form covalent bonds with other molecules, making it more likely to cause adverse effects such as injury, poisoning, and procedural complications.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a polar functional group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects. For example, if a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is polar and can form covalent bonds with other molecules, making it more likely to cause adverse effects such as injury, poisoning, and procedural complications.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a polycyclic structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects. For example, if a molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5), it is a polycyclic structure and can form covalent bonds with other molecules, making it more likely to cause adverse effects such as injury, poisoning, and procedural complications.

To come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect, we need to analyze the data and identify patterns. Here are the steps:
1. Identify the labels (0 and 1) associated with each smiles string. In this case, label 1 means the smiles string is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to injury, poisoning and procedural complications, while label 0 means the smiles string is not.
2. Analyze the data to identify any patterns or relationships between the properties/structures of the molecules and their side-effect activity. For example, we might find that molecules with certain functional groups or structures are more likely to cause adverse effects than others.
3. Use the identified patterns to develop rules that can be used to predict whether a new molecule is likely to cause adverse effects based on its properties/structures. For example, we might develop a rule that molecules with a certain number of nitrogen atoms or a certain type of functional group are more likely to cause adverse effects than others.
Based on the data provided, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it is more likely to cause adverse effects than a molecule without a carbonyl group.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects than a molecule without a nitro group.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects than a molecule without a sulfonamide group.
These rules are based on the analysis of the data and the identification of patterns in the properties/structures of the molecules and their side-effect activity. They can be used to predict whether a new molecule is likely to cause adverse effects based on its properties/structures.

================================

1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects such as injury, poisoning, or procedural complications, it is likely to cause adverse effects as well. For example, if a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it is likely to cause adverse effects due to its ability to inhibit the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which is essential for the proper functioning of the body's pH regulation system.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, it is likely to cause adverse effects even if it does not contain that specific functional group. For example, if a molecule contains a benzene ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects due to its ability to interact with biological molecules and cause toxicity.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains multiple functional groups that are known to cause adverse effects, it is likely to cause adverse effects more frequently than if it contains only one such group. For example, if a molecule contains both a sulfonamide group and a benzene ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects more frequently than if it contains only one of these groups.
In the provided data, the first rule can be inferred by analyzing the structure of the molecule and identifying the presence of the sulfonamide group. The second rule can be inferred by analyzing the structure of the molecule and identifying the presence of the benzene ring. The third rule can be inferred by analyzing the structure of the molecule and identifying the presence of multiple functional groups that are known to cause adverse effects.
