1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as an amide or an ester, it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to skin and eye irritation.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory disorders.
Explanation:
1. Rule 1 is based on the fact that amides and esters are common functional groups found in drugs and are known to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. Therefore, if a molecule contains these functional groups, it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
2. Rule 2 is based on the fact that halogen atoms are known to cause skin and eye irritation. Therefore, if a molecule contains a halogen atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to skin and eye irritation.
3. Rule 3 is based on the fact that nitro groups are known to cause respiratory disorders. Therefore, if a molecule contains a nitro group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory disorders.

================================

Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:
1. Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause gastrointestinal disorders, such as the -OH group in aspirin, then it is likely to cause adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: If the molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause skin irritation, such as the -Cl group in chlorine, then it is likely to cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: If the molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause respiratory problems, such as the -NO2 group in nitrobenzene, then it is likely to cause adverse effects.
These rules can be inferred from the given data by analyzing the structures of the molecules and identifying the functional groups that are present.

Based on the provided data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:
1. Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
2. Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
3. Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
These rules can be inferred by analyzing the structures of the molecules and looking for specific functional groups or atoms that are commonly associated with adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.

================================

1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as an amidine group (-C(=NH)=NH-), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a functional group such as a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a functional group such as a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
These rules are based on the observation that these functional groups are commonly found in molecules that cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. However, it is important to note that these rules are not foolproof and there may be exceptions to them. It is always best to consult with a qualified chemist before making any decisions based on these rules.

1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as an amide, imide, or urea group, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogenated aromatic ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to respiratory disorders.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to genotoxicity and carcinogenicity.
These rules are based on the observation that molecules containing these functional groups or structures are often associated with adverse effects in humans. However, it is important to note that these rules are not definitive and should be used as a starting point for further research and analysis.

1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
These rules are based on the fact that nitro groups, chlorine atoms, and carbonyl groups are commonly found in molecules that cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. However, it is important to note that these rules are not foolproof and should be used with caution. It is always best to consult with a qualified chemist before making any decisions based on these rules.
