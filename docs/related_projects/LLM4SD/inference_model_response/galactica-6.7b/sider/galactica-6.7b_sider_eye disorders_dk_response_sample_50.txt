2. Rule 2 is based on the observation that halogen atoms are often found in molecules that cause adverse effects. Halogen atoms can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their function. Therefore, any molecule that contains a halogen atom is more likely to cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3 is based on the observation that carbonyl groups are often found in molecules that cause adverse effects. Carbonyl groups can react with biological molecules and cause damage. Therefore, any molecule that contains a carbonyl group is more likely to cause adverse effects.

================================

1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause eye disorders, it is likely to have a side effect related to eye disorders. For example, if a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it is known to cause eye disorders. Therefore, if a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it is likely to have a side effect related to eye disorders.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause skin irritation, it is likely to have a side effect related to skin irritation. For example, if a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it is known to cause skin irritation.

The third molecule, CCC1=C(C(=NC(=N1)N)N)C2=CC=C(C=C2)Cl 0, does not contain a nitro group (-NO2). Therefore, the first two molecules are more likely to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders.
2. Rule 2: The fourth molecule, C1CCN(CC1)C2=NC(=N)N(C(=C2)N)O 0, contains a chlorine atom (-Cl). The fifth molecule, C1CCC2=C(C1)C=CC=C2NC3=NCCN3 0, also contains a chlorine atom (-Cl). The sixth molecule, CNC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1SC2=CC3=C(C=C2)C(=NN3)C=CC4=CC=CC=N4 1, does not contain a chlorine atom (-Cl). Therefore, the fourth and fifth molecules are more likely to cause adverse effects related to skin and eye disorders.

3. Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I), it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Explanation:
1. The first rule is based on the fact that the presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule is often associated with adverse effects such as eye disorders, skin irritation, and respiratory problems. This is because the carbonyl group can react with other molecules in the body to form toxic products.
2. The second rule is based on the fact that the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule is often associated with beneficial effects such as anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. However, if the molecule also contains other toxic groups, the overall effect may be negative.
3. The third rule is based on the fact that the presence of a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule is often associated with beneficial effects such as antibacterial and antiviral properties. However, if the molecule also contains other toxic groups, the overall effect may be negative.
Overall, these rules can be used to predict whether a molecule is likely to cause adverse effects based on its chemical structure. However, it is important to note that these rules are not foolproof and may not always be accurate. It is always recommended to consult with a qualified chemist before making any decisions based on these rules.
