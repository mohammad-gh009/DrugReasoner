Explanation:
1. The first rule is based on the observation that nitro groups are commonly found in molecules that are associated with adverse effects. Nitro groups can interact with biological molecules such as proteins and enzymes, leading to changes in their structure and function. This can cause adverse effects such as tissue damage, inflammation, and cancer.
2. The second rule is based on the observation that carbonyl groups are commonly found in molecules that are associated with adverse effects. Carbonyl groups can interact with biological molecules such as proteins and enzymes, leading to changes in their structure and function. This can cause adverse effects such as tissue damage, inflammation, and cancer.
3. The third rule is based on the observation that halogen atoms are commonly found in molecules that are associated with adverse effects. Halogen atoms can interact with biological molecules such as proteins and enzymes, leading to changes in their structure and function. This can cause adverse effects such as tissue damage, inflammation, and cancer.
