This can lead to adverse effects such as skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
3. The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects because carbonyl compounds are known to be highly reactive and can interact with biological molecules such as proteins and DNA. This can lead to adverse effects such as skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
