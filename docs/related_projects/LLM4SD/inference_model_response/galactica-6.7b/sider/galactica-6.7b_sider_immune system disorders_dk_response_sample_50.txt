1. Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.

3. Rule 3: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
Explanation:
1. The first rule is based on the fact that the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects. This is because the carbonyl group is a highly reactive functional group that can form covalent bonds with other molecules, which can lead to the formation of toxic metabolites.
2. The second rule is based on the fact that the presence of a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) in a molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects. This is because halogen atoms are highly reactive and can form covalent bonds with other molecules, which can lead to the formation of toxic metabolites.
3. The third rule is based on the fact that the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects. This is because the nitro group is a highly reactive functional group that can form covalent bonds with other molecules, which can lead to the formation of toxic metabolites.
