Based on the provided data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:
1. Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders.
2. Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders.
3. Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders.
These rules can be inferred by analyzing the structures of the molecules and looking for the presence of specific functional groups or atoms that are known to be associated with adverse effects.

Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:
1. Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to the nervous system.
2. Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to the nervous system.
3. Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is more likely to cause adverse effects related to the nervous system.
These rules can be inferred from the given data as follows:
1. Rule 1: The given molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), which suggests that it may interact with the nervous system and cause adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: The given molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine), which suggests that it may interact with the nervous system and cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: The given molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), which suggests that it may interact with the nervous system and cause adverse effects.
