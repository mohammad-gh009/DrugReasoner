Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:
1. Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
2. Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
3. Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.

1. Rule 1: The first molecule, COC(=O)C(C1=CC=CC=C1Cl)N2CCC3=C(C2)C=CS3, contains a chlorine atom and is labeled as 0, which means it is not related to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This suggests that the presence of a chlorine atom alone is not sufficient to cause adverse effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
2. Rule 2: The second molecule, C1NC2=CC(=C(C=C2S(=O)(=O)N1)S(=O)(=O)N)Cl, contains a nitrogen atom and is labeled as 0, which means it is not related to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.

3. Rule 3: The third molecule, CC1CC(=O)NN=C1C2=CC=C(C=C2)NN=C(C#N)C#N, contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and is labeled as 0, which means it is not related to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
