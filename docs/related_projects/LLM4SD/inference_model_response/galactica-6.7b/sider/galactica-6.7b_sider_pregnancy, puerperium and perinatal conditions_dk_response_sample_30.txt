Based on the provided data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:
1. Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
2. Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
3. Rule 3: If the molecule contains a guanidine group (-C(NH2)=NH-), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
These rules are based on the fact that the molecules in the dataset have been tested for their side-effect activity, and some of them have been found to cause adverse effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH), sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), and guanidine group (-C(NH2)=NH-) are common functional groups found in drugs and other chemicals that have been associated with adverse effects.

3. Rule 3: The dosage and duration of exposure to a molecule can also affect its potential to cause adverse effects. For example, a low dosage of a molecule may not cause adverse effects, while a high dosage may do so. Similarly, a short duration of exposure may not cause adverse effects, while a long duration may do so.

3. Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
These rules can be inferred from the given data as follows:
1. Rule 1: The first molecule (COCCOC1=C(C=C2C(=C1)C(=NC=N2)NC3=CC=CC(=C3)C#C)OCCOC) contains a nitro group (-NO2) and is labeled as causing adverse effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions (label 1).
2. Rule 2: The second molecule (C1=CC(=CC=C1N)S(=O)(=O)N) contains a chlorine atom (-Cl) and is labeled as not causing adverse effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions (label 0).
3. Rule 3: The third molecule (CCC(C)N1C(=O)N(C=N1)C2=CC=C(C=C2)N3CCN(CC3)C4=CC=C(C=C4)OCC5COC(O5)(CN6C=NC=N6)C7=C(C=C(C=C7)Cl)Cl) contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and is labeled as causing adverse effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions (label 1).
