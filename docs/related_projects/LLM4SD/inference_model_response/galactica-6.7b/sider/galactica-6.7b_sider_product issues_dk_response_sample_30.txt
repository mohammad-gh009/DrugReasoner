1. Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I), it is likely to cause adverse effects.
These rules can be inferred from the provided data as follows:
