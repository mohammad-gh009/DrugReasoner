1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogenated aromatic ring, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Explanation:
1. Rule 1 is based on the fact that carboxylic acid groups are commonly found in molecules that cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. For example, aspirin, a common pain reliever and anti-inflammatory drug, contains a carboxylic acid group and is known to cause stomach ulcers and other gastrointestinal side effects. Similarly, some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen, also contain carboxylic acid groups and are known to cause similar side effects.
2. Rule 2 is based on the fact that halogenated aromatic rings are commonly found in molecules that cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. For example, some antidepressants, such as amitriptyline and nortriptyline, contain halogenated aromatic rings and are known to cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Similarly, some antibiotics, such as penicillin and ampicillin, also contain halogenated aromatic rings and are known to cause side effects such as skin rashes and fever.
3. Rule 3 is based on the fact that nitro groups are commonly found in molecules that cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. For example, nitrofurantoin, a common antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections, contains a nitro group and is known to cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Similarly, some anti-cancer drugs, such as cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide, also contain nitro groups and are known to cause side effects such as bone marrow suppression and hemorrhagic cystitis.
