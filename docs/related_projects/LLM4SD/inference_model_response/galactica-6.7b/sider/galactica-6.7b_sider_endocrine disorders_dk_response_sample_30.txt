The second molecule (with label 0) does not contain a carboxylic acid group, so it is less likely to cause adverse effects related to endocrine disorders.
2. Rule 2: The third molecule (with label 0) contains a nitro group (-NO2), which suggests that it may be related to endocrine disorders. The fourth molecule (with label 1) does not contain a nitro group, so it is less likely to cause adverse effects related to endocrine disorders.
3. Rule 3: The fifth molecule (with label 0) contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine), which suggests that it may be related to endocrine disorders. The sixth molecule (with label 1) does not contain a halogen atom, so it is less likely to cause adverse effects related to endocrine disorders.

================================

1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group that is associated with endocrine disorders, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a polar functional group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a ring structure, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
Explanation:
1. Rule 1 is based on the observation that certain functional groups are associated with endocrine disorders. For example, molecules containing the hydroxyl group (-OH) or the amino group (-NH2) are commonly associated with endocrine disorders. Therefore, if a molecule contains any of these functional groups, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
2. Rule 2 is based on the observation that polar functional groups are more likely to interact with biological molecules and cause adverse effects. Polar functional groups have a partial negative charge on one end and a partial positive charge on the other end, which allows them to interact with other molecules in the body. Non-polar functional groups, on the other hand, have no partial charges and are less likely to interact with biological molecules. Therefore, if a molecule contains a polar functional group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3 is based on the observation that ring structures are less likely to cause adverse effects. Rings are rigid structures that are less flexible than linear structures, and they are less likely to interact with biological molecules. Therefore, if a molecule contains a ring structure, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
