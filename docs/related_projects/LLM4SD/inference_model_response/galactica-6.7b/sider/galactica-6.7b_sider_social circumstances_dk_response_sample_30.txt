3. Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Explanation:
1. Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects. This is because nitro groups are highly reactive and can interact with biological molecules such as proteins and enzymes, which can lead to adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: The presence of a chlorine atom in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects. Chlorine atoms can form covalent bonds with biological molecules, which can also lead to adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group in a molecule increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects. Carbonyl groups can form covalent bonds with biological molecules, which can also lead to adverse effects.

================================

1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to cause adverse effects, such as a nitro group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a functional group that is known to be toxic, such as a benzene ring, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains multiple functional groups that are known to cause adverse effects, such as a combination of a nitro group and a benzene ring, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
