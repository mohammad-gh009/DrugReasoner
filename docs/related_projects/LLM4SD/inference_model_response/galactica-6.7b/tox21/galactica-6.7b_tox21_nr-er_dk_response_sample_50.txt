2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.

Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
These rules are based on the data provided and can be used to predict whether a new molecule is likely to cause adverse effects based on its structure.

Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without halogen atoms.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (such as a ketone or an aldehyde), it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without a carbonyl group.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (such as a nitrite or a nitrate), it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without a nitro group.
These rules can be inferred from the given data as follows:
1. Rule 1: The molecule with the smiles string "ClSC(Cl)(Cl)Cl" contains a halogen atom (chlorine), which suggests that it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without halogen atoms.
2. Rule 2: The molecule with the smiles string "O=S(=O)([O-])c1ccc2cc(O)ccc2c1" contains a carbonyl group (sulfate), which suggests that it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without a carbonyl group.
3. Rule 3: The molecule with the smiles string "O=C1CCCO1" contains a nitro group (nitrite), which suggests that it is more likely to be toxic than a molecule without a nitro group.

Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:
1. Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
2. Rule 2: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
3. Rule 3: The presence of a halogen atom (-Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.

These rules can be inferred from the given data as follows:
1. Rule 1: The molecule with the smiles string "CC(C)OC(=O)c1cc2c(OCC(O)CNC(C)(C)C)cccc2[nH]1" contains a nitro group (-NO2) and has a toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway with a score of 0.0.
2. Rule 2: The molecule with the smiles string "O=NN(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1 1.0" contains a halogen atom (fluorine) and has a toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway with a score of 1.0.
3. Rule 3: The molecule with the smiles string "CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)CC(C)O)cc1 0.0" contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and has a toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway with a score of 0.0.
