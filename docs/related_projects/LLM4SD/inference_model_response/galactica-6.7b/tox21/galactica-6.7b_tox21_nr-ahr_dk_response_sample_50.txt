1. Rule 1: The presence of halogen atoms (such as fluorine, chlorine, and bromine) in a molecule can increase its toxicity.
2. Rule 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule can increase its toxicity.
3. Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule can increase its toxicity.
These rules can be inferred from the data provided, where molecules with halogen atoms, nitro groups, and carbonyl groups have a higher probability of causing adverse effects.
