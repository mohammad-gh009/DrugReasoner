Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:
1. Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
2. Rule 2: The presence of a sulfur atom (S) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
3. Rule 3: The presence of a chlorine atom (Cl) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
These rules can be inferred from the data as follows:
1. Rule 1: The molecule with the smiles string "O=NN1CCCCCC1" contains a nitro group (-NO2). The molecule with the smiles string "CN(C)C(=O)Oc1ccc[n+](C)c1" also contains a nitro group (-NO2). The molecule with the smiles string "CCCCN(CCCC)C(=S)SSC(=S)N(CCCC)CCCC" contains a sulfur atom (S). Therefore, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and a sulfur atom (S) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
2. Rule 2: The molecule with the smiles string "O=c1cc(-c2ccc(O)cc2)oc2cc(O)cc(O)c12" contains a chlorine atom (Cl). Therefore, the presence of a chlorine atom (Cl) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
3. Rule 3: The molecule with the smiles string "O=c1cc(-c2ccc(O)cc2)oc2cc(O)cc(O)c12" contains a chlorine atom (Cl).
