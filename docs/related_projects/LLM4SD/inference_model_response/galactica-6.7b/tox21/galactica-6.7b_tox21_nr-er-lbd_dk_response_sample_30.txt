2. Rule 2: The molecule with the smiles string "N=C(N)NCCCCNC(=N)N" contains a nitro group (-NO2). Therefore, it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: The molecule with the smiles string "Cc1ccc(C2(O)CCN(CCCC(=O)c3ccc(F)cc3)CC2)cc1" contains a halogen atom (-Cl). Therefore, it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
These rules can be inferred from the data as follows:
1. Rule 1: The molecule with the smiles string "ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C(Cl)C=CC3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl" contains a chlorine atom, which is a halogen atom. Therefore, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: The molecule with the smiles string "CCCOCC(C)O" contains a nitro group (-NO2). Therefore, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: The molecule with the smiles string "CC(C)(C)c1cccc(O)c1" contains a carbonyl group (-C=O). Therefore, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:
1. Rule 1: The presence of a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) in a molecule increases its toxicity against the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
2. Rule 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity against the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
3. Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity against the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
