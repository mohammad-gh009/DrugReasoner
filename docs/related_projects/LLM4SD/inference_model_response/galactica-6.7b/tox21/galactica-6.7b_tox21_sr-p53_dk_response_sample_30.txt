Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:
1. Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the DNA damage p53-pathway in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
2. Rule 2: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the DNA damage p53-pathway in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
3. Rule 3: The presence of a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, -I) in a molecule increases its toxicity activity against the DNA damage p53-pathway in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
