1. Rule 1: The molecule with the smiles string "Clc1cccc(-c2cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c2)c1 0.0" contains a chlorine atom, which is a halogen atom. Therefore, it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: The molecule with the smiles string "CC1=NN(c2ccccc2)C(=O)C1 0.0" contains a carbonyl group. Therefore, it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: The molecule with the smiles string "CN(C)C(=O)CNC(=O)Cc1ccccc1 0.0" contains a nitro group. Therefore, it is likely to be toxic and can cause adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:
1. Rule 1: The presence of a chlorine atom in the molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
2. Rule 2: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
3. Rule 3: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects.
These rules can be inferred from the data as follows:
1. Rule 1: The molecule with the smiles string "ClC(Cl)=C(Cl)Cl" has a high toxicity activity against the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway. This suggests that the presence of chlorine atoms in the molecule may increase its toxicity.
2. Rule 2: The molecule with the smiles string "O=C1CCCO1" has a high toxicity activity against the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway. This suggests that the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the molecule may increase its toxicity.
3. Rule 3: The molecule with the smiles string "Nc1ccc(NCCO)c([N+](=O)[O-])c1" has a high toxicity activity against the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway. This suggests that the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecule may increase its toxicity.
