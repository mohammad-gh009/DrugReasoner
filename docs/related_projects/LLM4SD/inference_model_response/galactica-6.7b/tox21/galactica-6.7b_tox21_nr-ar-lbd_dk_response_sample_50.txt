These rules can be inferred by analyzing the given data and identifying the common structural features that are associated with toxicity activity. For example, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) or a carbonyl group (-C=O) in a molecule is often associated with toxicity, as these functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt normal cellular processes. Similarly, the presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) in a molecule can also increase its toxicity due to its ability to interact with biological molecules and disrupt normal cellular processes.
