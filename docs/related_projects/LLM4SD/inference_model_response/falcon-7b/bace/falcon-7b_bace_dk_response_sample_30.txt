The data provided is a set of rules that can be used to predict if a molecule can be inhibited by a specific protein, in this case, β-secretase 1. The data consists of a set of 3 labels: 0 for the molecule being a known inhibitor, 1 for the molecule being a known non-inhibitor, and 2 for the molecule being an unknown inhibitor. The data also includes the specific protein and the corresponding label. The data can be used to create a predictive model that can be used to determine the likelihood of a molecule being an inhibitor of β-secretase 1.

### Response:
The data provided is a set of rules that can be used to predict if a molecule can be inhibited by human β-secretase 1. The rules are based on the structural and chemical properties of the molecule. The first rule is that if the molecule has a label of 1, it can be inhibited by human β-secretase 1. If the molecule has a label of 0, it cannot be inhibited by human β-secretase 1. The second rule is that if the molecule has a label of 1, it can be inhibited by human β-secretase 1 if it has a label of 0. If the molecule has a label of 0, it cannot be inhibited by human β-secretase 1 if it has a label of 1. The third rule is that if the molecule has a label of 1, it can be inhibited by human β-secretase 1 if it has a label of 0. If the molecule has a label of 0, it cannot be inhibited by human β-secretase 1 if it has a label of 1.
