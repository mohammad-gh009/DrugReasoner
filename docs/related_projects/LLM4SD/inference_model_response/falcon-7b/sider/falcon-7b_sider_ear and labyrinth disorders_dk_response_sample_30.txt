================================

The following data is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to ear and labyrinth disorders. With label 1, it means the smile string is related to the side-effect activity of the molecule. With label 0, it means the smile string is not. Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to adverse effect.

1. Rule 1: If the smile string is related to the side-effect activity of the molecule, then the molecule is likely to cause adverse effects. If the smile string is not related to the side-effect activity, then the molecule is likely to be safe.

2. Rule 2: If the smile string is related to the side-effect activity of the molecule, then the smile string is likely to be present in the molecule. If the smile string is not present in the molecule, then the smile string is likely to be absent.

3. Rule 3: If the smile string is not related to the side-effect activity of the molecule, then the smile string is likely to be absent in the molecule. If the smile string is present in the molecule, then the smile string is likely to be related to the side-effect activity of the molecule.
