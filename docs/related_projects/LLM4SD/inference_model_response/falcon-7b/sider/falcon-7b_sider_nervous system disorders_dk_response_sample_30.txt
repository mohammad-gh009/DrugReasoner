- The smile string should be located within the same residue as the side-chain carbon atom.
- The smile string should be located within the same residue as the side-chain nitrogen atom.

2. Rule 2: If the smile string is not related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should have at least one of the following properties:
- The molecule should have a side-chain carbon atom that is not directly connected to the smile string.
- The smile string should be located within the same residue as the side-chain nitrogen atom.
- The smile string should be located within the same residue as the side-chain oxygen atom.

3. Rule 3: If the smile string is not related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should have at least one of the following properties:
- The molecule should have a side-chain carbon atom that is not directly connected to the smile string.
- The smile string should be located within the same residue as the side-chain nitrogen atom.
- The smile string should be located within the same residue as the side-chain oxygen atom.

The following data is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to nervous system disorders. With label 0, it means the smile string is not related to the side-effect activity. Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule

================================

The data suggests that the label 1 is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to nervous system disorders. The label 0 indicates that the property or structure of the molecule is not related to the side-effect activity.

================================

The following data is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to nervous system disorders. With label 1, it means the smiley string is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to nervous system disorders. With label 0, it means the smiley string is not. Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to nervous system disorders.

1. Rule 1: If the smiley string is present, the molecule is likely to have side-effect activity related to nervous system disorders.

2. Rule 2: If the smiley string is not present, the molecule is likely to not have side-effect activity related to nervous system disorders.

3. Rule 3: If the smiley string is present and the molecule is not related to nervous system disorders, the molecule is likely to have other side-effect activity unrelated to nervous system disorders.
