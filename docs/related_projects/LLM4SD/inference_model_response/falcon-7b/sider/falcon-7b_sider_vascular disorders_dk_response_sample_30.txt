8. If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it is more likely to be involved in vascular disorders.

9. If the molecule contains a carbon atom, it is less likely to be involved in vascular disorders.

10. If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it is less likely to be involved in vascular disorders.

================================

The following data is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to vascular disorders. With label 0, it means the smiley string is not related to the side-effect activity. Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to the side-effect activity.

1. Rule 1: If the smiley string is related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should have a side-effect related to vascular disorders.

2. Rule 2: If the smiley string is not related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should not have a side-effect related to vascular disorders.

3. Rule 3: If the smiley string is related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should have a side-effect related to vascular disorders. If the smiley string is not related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should not have a side-effect related to vascular disorders.

================================

The following rules can be used to predict whether a molecule is likely to cause adverse effects:

1. If the molecule has a side-effect related to vascular disorders, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
2. If the molecule has a side-effect related to cardiovascular disorders, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
3. If the molecule has a side-effect related to respiratory disorders, it is likely to cause adverse effects.

These rules are based on the assumption that the side-effects of a molecule are related to its molecular structure and function.

The following data is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to vascular disorders. With label 0, it means the smile string is not related to the side-effect activity. Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to the side-effect activity.

1. Rule 1: If the smile string is related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should have at least one of the following properties:
- The molecule should have a side-chain carbon atom that is directly bonded to a nitrogen atom.
- The molecule should have at least one of the following functional groups:
- -NH2 (amino group)
- -O (oxygen atom)
- -C (carbon atom)
- -N (nitrogen atom)
- -S (sulfur atom)
- -Cl (chlorine atom)
- -Br (bromine atom)
- -Ar (aromatic ring)
- -R (aromatic ring)
- -X (halogen atom)
