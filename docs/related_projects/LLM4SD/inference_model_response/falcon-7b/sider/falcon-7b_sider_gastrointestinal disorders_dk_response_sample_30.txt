3. Rule 3: If the smile string is present, but the molecule is not likely to have side-effect activity, it may be due to the molecule being used in a therapeutic dose or for a specific medical condition.

================================

The data indicates that the molecule may have adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.

================================

The following data is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to gastrointestinal disorders. With label 0, it means the smile string is not related to the side-effect activity. Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to the side-effect activity.

1. Rule 1: If the smile string is related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should have at least one of the following properties:
- It should have a side chain that contains a functional group that can interact with the target protein.
- It should have a polar functional group that can interact with the target protein.
- It should have a large molecular weight that can be easily filtered out of the body.

2. Rule 2: If the smile string is not related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should have at least one of the following properties:
- It should have a small molecular weight that can be easily filtered out of the body.
- It should have a functional group that can interact with the target protein.
- It should have a side chain that contains a functional group that can interact with the target protein.

3. Rule 3: If the smile string is not related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should have at least one of the following properties:
- It should have a small molecular weight that can be easily filtered out of the body.
- It should have a functional group that can interact with the target protein.
- It should have a side chain that contains a functional group that can interact with the target protein.
