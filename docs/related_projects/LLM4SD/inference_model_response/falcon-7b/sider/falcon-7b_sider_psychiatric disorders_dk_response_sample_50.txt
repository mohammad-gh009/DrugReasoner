The instruction asks for a rule that can be used to predict whether a molecule is related to psychiatric disorders. The rule should be based on the properties/structures of the molecule and should be able to correctly classify all molecules that are related to psychiatric disorders. Here is a possible rule:

Rule: If a molecule has a side-effect related to psychiatric disorders, it is likely to have a structure that contains a benzene ring.

Explanation: Benzene rings are often found in molecules that have side-effects related to psychiatric disorders. This is because the benzene ring can disrupt the normal functioning of certain enzymes and proteins in the body, leading to side-effects. Therefore, if a molecule has a side-effect related to psychiatric disorders, it is likely to have a structure that contains a benzene ring.

Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to psychiatric disorders.

1. Rule 1: If the smile string is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule, the smile string should be present in the molecule's structure. If the smile string is not present, the molecule is not likely to cause adverse effects.

2. Rule 2: If the smile string is not present in the molecule's structure, the smile string should be present in the molecule's side-effect activity. If the smile string is not present, the molecule is likely to cause adverse effects.

3. Rule 3: If the smile string is present in the molecule's structure and the molecule's side-effect activity, the smile string is likely to cause adverse effects. If the smile string is not present in the molecule's structure and the molecule's side-effect activity, the molecule is likely to cause adverse effects.
