The following data is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule. With label 1, it means the smile string is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule. With label 0, it means the smile string is not. Please use the following rules to predict whether a molecule is likely to cause adverse effects:

1. If the smile string is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule, it is likely to cause adverse effects.
2. If the smile string is not related to the side-effect activity of a molecule, it is unlikely to cause adverse effects.

In this case, the smile string is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule. Therefore, it is likely to cause adverse effects.

The following data is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule. With label 1, it means the smile string is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule. With label 0, it means the smile string is not. Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect.

1. Rule 1: If the smile string is present, it is likely that the molecule is involved in the side-effect activity.
2. Rule 2: If the smile string is not present, it is likely that the molecule is not involved in the side-effect activity.
3. Rule 3: If the smile string is present and the molecule is not involved in the side-effect activity, it is likely that the molecule is involved in the side-effect activity.

================================

The three rules to predict whether a molecule can cause adverse effects are:

1. If the molecule has a side-effect related to product issues, it is likely to be related to the molecule's activity.

2. If the molecule has a side-effect related to product issues, it is likely to be related to the molecule's structure.

3. If the molecule has a side-effect related to product issues, it is likely to be related to the molecule's toxicity.

Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect.

1. Rule 1: If the smile string is related to product issues, then the molecule is likely to have a side-effect. If the smile string is not related to product issues, then the molecule is likely to be safe.

2. Rule 2: If the smile string is related to product issues, then the molecule is likely to have a low therapeutic index. If the smile string is not related to product issues, then the molecule is likely to have a high therapeutic index.

3. Rule 3: If the smile string is related to product issues, then the molecule is likely to have a low safety margin. If the smile string is not related to product issues, then the molecule is likely to have a high safety margin.

================================

The following data is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to product issues. With label 0, it means the smile string is not related to the side-effect activity. With label 1, it means the smile string is related to the side-effect activity. Please use the following rules to predict whether a molecule is likely to cause adverse effects:

1. If the smile string is related to the side-effect activity, the molecule is likely to cause adverse effects.
2. If the smile string is not related to the side-effect activity, the molecule is likely not to cause adverse effects.

In the given data, the smile string is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to product issues. Therefore, the molecule is likely to cause adverse effects.

================================

The following data is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule. With label 1, it means the smile string is related to product issues. With label 0, it means the smile string is not. Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it can cause adverse effect.

1. Rule 1: If the smile string is related to product issues, then the molecule is likely to have a side-effect. If the smile string is not related to product issues, then the molecule is likely to be safe.

2. Rule 2: If the smile string is related to product issues, then the molecule is likely to have a low therapeutic index. If the smile string is not related to product issues, then the molecule is likely to have a high therapeutic index.

3. Rule 3: If the smile string is related to product issues, then the molecule is likely to have a low safety margin. If the smile string is not related to product issues, then the molecule is likely to have a high safety margin.

================================

The data suggests that the molecule may cause adverse effects.
