Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to the side-effect activity.
1. If the smile string is related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should have at least one of the following properties:
- It should have a side-effect profile that includes musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
- It should have a high affinity for the musculoskeletal and connective tissue receptors.
- It should have a low affinity for the musculoskeletal and connective tissue receptors.

2. If the smile string is not related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should have at least one of the following properties:
- It should have a side-effect profile that includes musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
- It should have a high affinity for the musculoskeletal and connective tissue receptors.
- It should have a low affinity for the musculoskeletal and connective tissue receptors.

3. If the smile string is related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should have at least one of the following properties:
- It should have a side-effect profile that includes musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
- It should have a high affinity for the musculoskeletal and connective tissue receptors.
- It should have a low affinity for the musculoskeletal and connective tissue receptors.

The following data is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. With label 0, it means the smiley string is not related to the side-effect activity. Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to the side-effect activity.

1. Rule 1: If a molecule has a side-effect related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, it is likely to have a smiley string that contains the word "musculoskeletal" or "connective tissue".

2. Rule 2: If a molecule has a side-effect related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, it is likely to have a smiley string that contains the word "musculoskeletal" or "connective tissue".

3. Rule 3: If a molecule has a side-effect related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, it is likely to have a smiley string that contains the word "musculoskeletal" or "connective tissue".

================================

The three rules to predict whether a molecule can cause adverse effects are: 1) if the molecule has a side-effect related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, it is likely to have adverse effects; 2) if the molecule has a side-effect related to cardiovascular disorders, it is likely to have adverse effects; and 3) if the molecule has a side-effect related to gastrointestinal disorders, it is likely to have adverse effects.
