3. Rule 3: If the smiley string is present, the molecule is likely to have side-effect activity related to blood and lymphatic system disorders. If the smiley string is not present, the molecule is likely to be safe from side-effect activity related to blood and lymphatic system disorders.

================================

The following data is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to blood and lymphatic system disorders. With label 0, it means the smiley string is not related to the side-effect activity. Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to the side-effect activity.

1. Rule 1: If a molecule has a smiley string that starts with "C", it is likely related to the side-effect activity of blood and lymphatic system disorders.

2. Rule 2: If a molecule has a smiley string that starts with "O", it is likely related to the side-effect activity of blood and lymphatic system disorders.

3. Rule 3: If a molecule has a smiley string that starts with "C", it is likely related to the side-effect activity of blood and lymphatic system disorders. If a molecule has a smiley string that starts with "O", it is likely related to the side-effect activity of blood and lymphatic system disorders.
