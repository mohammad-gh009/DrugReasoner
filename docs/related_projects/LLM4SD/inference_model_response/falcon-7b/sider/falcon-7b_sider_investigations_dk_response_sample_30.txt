The following data is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule. With label 1, it means the smile string is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule. With label 0, it means the smile string is not. Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to the side-effect activity.

1. Rule 1: If the smile string is present, it is likely that the molecule has side-effect activity.
2. Rule 2: If the smile string is not present, it is likely that the molecule does not have side-effect activity.
3. Rule 3: If the smile string is present and the molecule does not have side-effect activity, it is likely that the molecule is used to treat a condition that does not have side-effect activity.

================================

The three rules to predict whether a molecule can cause an adverse effect are:

1. If the molecule has a side-effect activity related to investigations, it is likely to be related to adverse effects.

2. If the molecule has a side-effect activity related to drug metabolism, it is likely to be related to adverse effects.

3. If the molecule has a side-effect activity related to immune system, it is likely to be related to adverse effects.

These rules are based on the assumption that molecules with side-effect activities related to these areas are more likely to cause adverse effects.

1. Rule 1: If the smile string is related to the side-effect activity of an investigation, the molecule should have a smile string that is related to the side-effect activity. For example, if the smile string is related to an investigation of gastrointestinal side-effects, the molecule should have a smile string that is related to gastrointestinal side-effects.

2. Rule 2: If the smile string is not related to the side-effect activity of an investigation, the molecule should not have a smile string that is related to the side-effect activity. For example, if the smile string is related to an investigation of cardiovascular side-effects, the molecule should not have a smile string that is related to cardiovascular side-effects.

3. Rule 3: If the smile string is related to the side-effect activity of an investigation, the molecule should have a smile string that is related to the side-effect activity. For example, if the smile string is related to an investigation of liver side-effects, the molecule should have a smile string that is related to liver side-effects.
