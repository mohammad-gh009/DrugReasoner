Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to the side-effect activity.

1. Rule 1: If the smile string is related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should have at least one of the following properties:
- It should have a side-effect profile that includes respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
- It should have a side-effect profile that includes respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
- It should have a side-effect profile that includes respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.

2. Rule 2: If the smile string is not related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should not have any of the following properties:
- It should not have a side-effect profile that includes respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
- It should not have a side-effect profile that includes respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
- It should not have a side-effect profile that includes respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.

3. Rule 3: If the smile string is related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should have at least one of the following properties:
- It should have a side-effect profile that includes respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
- It should have a side-effect profile that includes respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
- It should have a side-effect profile that includes respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.

================================

The following data is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. With label 0, it means the smile string is not related to the side-effect activity. Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to the side-effect activity.

1. Rule 1: If a molecule has a side-effect related to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, it is likely to have a smile string that is related to the side-effect activity.

2. Rule 2: If a molecule has a side-effect related to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, it is likely to have a smile string that is not related to the side-effect activity.

3. Rule 3: If a molecule has a side-effect related to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, it is likely to have a smile string that is related to the side-effect activity.

The following data is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. With label 0, it means the smile string is not related to this side-effect activity. Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to the side-effect activity.

1. Rule 1: If the smile string is related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should have at least one of the following properties:
- It should have a side-chain carbon atom that is part of a ring structure.
- It should have at least one of the following functional groups:
- O (oxygen)
- N (nitrogen)
- S (sulfur)
- C (carbon)
- H (hydrogen)
- The number of carbon atoms in the molecule should be at least 3.

2. Rule 2: If the smile string is not related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should have at least one of the following properties:
- It should have a side-chain carbon atom that is not part of a ring structure.
- It should have at least one of the following functional groups:
- O (oxygen)
- N (nitrogen)
- S (sulfur)
- C (carbon)
- H (hydrogen)
- The number of carbon atoms in the molecule should be at least 3.

3. Rule 3: If the smile string is related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should have at least one of the following properties:
- It should have a side-chain carbon atom that is part of a ring structure.
- It should have at least one of the following functional groups:
- O (oxygen)
- N (nitrogen)
- S (sulfur)
