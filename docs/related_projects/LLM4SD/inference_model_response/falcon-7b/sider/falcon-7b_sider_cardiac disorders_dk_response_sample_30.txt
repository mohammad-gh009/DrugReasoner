The response is a correct prediction that the molecule is related to cardiac disorders. The rule is that if a molecule is related to a specific side-effect activity, then it is likely to be related to cardiac disorders.

================================

The data suggests that the molecule with label 1 is related to cardiac disorders. To come up with 3 rules to predict whether a molecule is likely to cause adverse effects, one can use the following information:

1. If the molecule has a label of 1, it is likely to cause cardiac disorders.
2. If the molecule has a label of 2, it is likely to cause gastrointestinal disorders.
3. If the molecule has a label of 3, it is likely to cause liver disorders.

Using these rules, one can infer that the molecule with label 1 is likely to cause cardiac disorders, and the molecule with label 2 is likely to cause gastrointestinal disorders. The molecule with label 3 is likely to cause liver disorders.
