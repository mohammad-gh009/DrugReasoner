The data suggests that the molecule may have adverse effects related to infections and infestations. The presence of the label 1 indicates that the molecule is related to side-effect activity of an infection or an infestation. The absence of the label 0 indicates that the molecule is not related to this side-effect activity.

================================

The following data is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to infections and infestations. With label 0, it means the smiley string is not related to this property. Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to its side-effect activity.

1. Rule 1: If a molecule has a smiley string that starts with "C", it is likely related to the side-effect activity of the molecule.

2. Rule 2: If a molecule has a smiley string that starts with "C" and ends with "C", it is likely related to the side-effect activity of the molecule.

3. Rule 3: If a molecule has a smiley string that starts with "C" and ends with "C" and contains a smiley string that starts with "O", it is likely related to the side-effect activity of the molecule.
