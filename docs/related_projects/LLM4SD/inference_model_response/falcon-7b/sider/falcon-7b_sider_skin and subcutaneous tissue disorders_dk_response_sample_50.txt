The following data is related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. With label 0, it means the smiley string is not related to this type of disorder. Please use the following rules to predict whether a molecule is related to this disorder:

1. If the smiley string contains the word "adverse", it is likely related to this disorder.
2. If the smiley string contains the word "adverse" or "side-effect", it is likely related to this disorder.
3. If the smiley string contains the word "adverse" or "side-effect", it is likely related to this disorder.

Based on these rules, the smiley string "adverse" or "side-effect" is likely related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
