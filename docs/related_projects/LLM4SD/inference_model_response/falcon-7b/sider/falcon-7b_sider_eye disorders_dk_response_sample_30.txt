================================

The data suggests that the side-effect activity of a molecule related to eye disorders is related to the presence of a specific structure. To infer this, we can use the following rules:

1. If a molecule has a side-effect activity related to eye disorders, it is likely to have a structure that contains a specific functional group (e.g., C=C) or a specific substructure (e.g., a carbon chain).

2. If a molecule has a side-effect activity related to a different organ or system, it is likely to have a structure that contains a different functional group or substructure.

3. If a molecule has a side-effect activity related to a different disease or condition, it is likely to have a structure that contains a different functional group or substructure.

Based on these rules, we can infer that the structure of a molecule related to eye disorders is likely to have a carbon chain or a specific substructure (e.g., a cyclooctadienyl group).

================================

The following rules can be used to predict whether a molecule can cause adverse effects:

1. If the molecule has a side-effect related to eye disorders, it is likely to be related to the molecule's structure.
2. If the molecule has a side-effect related to cardiovascular disorders, it is likely to be related to the molecule's structure.
3. If the molecule has a side-effect related to gastrointestinal disorders, it is likely to be related to the molecule's structure.

These rules can be used to determine whether a molecule is likely to cause adverse effects or not.
