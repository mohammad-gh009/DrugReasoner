The following data is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to social circumstances. With label 1, it means the smiles string is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to social circumstances. With label 0, it means the smiles string is not. Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to the side-effect activity of a molecule related to social circumstances.

1. Rule 1: If the smiles string is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule, the smiles string should be present in the molecule. If the smiles string is not present, it is likely that the molecule does not have a side-effect activity related to social circumstances.

2. Rule 2: If the smiles string is not present in the molecule, it is likely that the molecule does not have a side-effect activity related to social circumstances.

3. Rule 3: If the smiles string is present in the molecule, it is likely that the molecule has a side-effect activity related to social circumstances.

================================

The data suggests that the side-effect activity of a molecule related to social circumstances is related to the presence of a smiley string. The specific rules to predict whether a molecule will cause adverse effects are: 1) if the smiley string is present, then the molecule is likely to cause adverse effects; 2) if the smiley string is not present, then the molecule is unlikely to cause adverse effects.

2. Rule 2: If the smile string is not related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should not have a side-effect related to social circumstances.

3. Rule 3: If the smile string is related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should have a side-effect related to social circumstances. If the smile string is not related to the side-effect activity, the molecule should not have a side-effect related to social circumstances.

================================

The following data is related to the side-effect activity of a molecule. With label 1, it means the smile string is related to social circumstances. With label 0, it means the smile string is not. Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to the side-effect activity.

1. Rule 1: If the smile string is related to social circumstances, the molecule is likely to have a side-effect related to social interactions.

2. Rule 2: If the smile string is not related to social circumstances, the molecule is likely to have a side-effect related to physical or chemical interactions.

3. Rule 3: If the smile string is related to social circumstances and the molecule has a side-effect related to physical or chemical interactions, it is likely to have a side-effect related to social interactions.
