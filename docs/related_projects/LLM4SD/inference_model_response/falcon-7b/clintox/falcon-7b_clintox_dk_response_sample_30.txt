### Response:
The molecule is approved by FDA if it has been shown to be safe and effective for its intended use.

### Response:
The following data is provided to help you complete the task. The data contains a molecule with a label of 1 and a label of 0. The label of 1 indicates that the molecule is approved by FDA, while the label of 0 indicates that the molecule failed clinical trials for toxicity reasons.

### Response:
The data provided is a molecular formula of a molecule. The instruction asks for three rules that can be used to predict if a molecule will be approved by FDA. The rules are:

1. If the molecule has a label of 0, it means it has been approved by FDA for clinical trials.

2. If the molecule has a label of 1, it means it has been approved by FDA for use in humans.

3. If the molecule has a label of 2, it means it has been approved by FDA for use in animals.

The response should provide a set of rules that can be used to determine the approval status of a molecule.

### Response:
The molecule is approved by FDA if it has been shown to be safe and effective for its intended use. The FDA uses a risk-based approach to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs. The data provided in the instruction are used to determine the risk-based classification of the drug. The classification is based on the following factors:

1. The type of drug: The classification is based on the type of drug, such as a vaccine or a therapeutic drug.

2. The intended use: The classification is based on the intended use of the drug, such as a treatment for a specific disease or a preventive measure.

3. The safety and effectiveness data: The classification is based on the safety and effectiveness data, such as the number of adverse reactions, the number of deaths, and the duration of the drug's use.

4. The risk-based classification: The classification is based on the risk-based classification of the drug, which is determined by the FDA based on the data provided.
