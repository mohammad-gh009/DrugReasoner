The following data represents a set of rules that can be used to predict whether a molecule is related to toxicity activity against the mitochondrial membrane potential in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway. The rules are based on the presence of specific structural features in the molecule and the presence of specific functional groups. The rules are as follows:

1. If the molecule contains a carbon chain with 3 or more carbon atoms, it is likely to be involved in the SR signaling pathway.

2. If the molecule contains a functional group that is not a carbon chain, it is likely to be involved in the SR signaling pathway.

3. If the molecule contains a functional group that is a carbon chain, it is likely to be involved in the SR signaling pathway.

4. If the molecule contains a functional group that is not a carbon chain, it is likely to be involved in the SR signaling pathway.

5. If the molecule contains a functional group that is a carbon chain, it is likely to be involved in the SR signaling pathway.

6. If the molecule contains a functional group that is not a carbon chain, it is likely to be involved in the SR signaling pathway.

7. If the molecule contains a functional group that is not a carbon chain, it is likely to be involved in the SR signaling pathway.

8. If the molecule contains a functional group that is a carbon chain, it is likely to be involved in the SR signaling pathway.

9. If the molecule contains a functional group that is not a carbon chain, it is likely to be involved in the SR signaling pathway.

10. If the molecule contains a functional group that is not a carbon chain, it is likely to be involved in the SR signaling pathway.

11. If the molecule contains a functional group that is not a carbon chain, it is likely to be involved in the SR signaling pathway.
