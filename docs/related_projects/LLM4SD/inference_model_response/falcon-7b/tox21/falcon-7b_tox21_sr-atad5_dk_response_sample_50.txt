3. Rule 3: If the smile string is related to the genotoxicity, then the molecule is likely to be a genotoxic agent.

================================

The following data is related to the toxicity activity of a molecule against the genotoxicity indicated by ATAD5 in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway. With label 0, it means the smile string is not related to the genotoxicity. Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to the genotoxicity.

1. Rule 1: If the smile string is related to the genotoxicity, the property/structure of the molecule that is most related to the genotoxicity should be the most prominent in the smile string.

2. Rule 2: If the smile string is not related to the genotoxicity, the property/structure of the molecule that is most related to the genotoxicity should be the most prominent in the smile string.

3. Rule 3: If the smile string is related to the genotoxicity, the property/structure of the molecule that is most related to the genotoxicity should be the most prominent in the smile string.

================================

The following data indicates that the molecule with the label 1 is related to toxicity activity against the genotoxicity indicated by ATAD5 in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway. The data indicates that the molecule with the label 0 is not related to the genotoxicity. The data indicates that the molecule with the label 0 is not related to the genotoxicity.

================================

The following data indicates that the molecule with label 1 is related to toxicity activity against the genotoxicity indicated by ATAD5 in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway. The data also indicates that the molecule with label 0 is not related to the genotoxicity.

================================

The following data indicates that the molecule with the label 1 is related to toxicity activity against the genotoxicity indicated by ATAD5 in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway. The molecule with the label 0 is not related to the genotoxicity. The data indicates that the molecule with the label 0 is related to the genotoxicity indicated by ATAD5 in the SR signaling pathway.

================================

The following data is related to the toxicity activity of a molecule against the genotoxicity indicated by ATAD5 in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway. With label 0, it means the smile string is not related to the genotoxicity. Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it can cause adverse effect.

1. Rule 1: If the smile string is related to the genotoxicity, then the molecule is likely to be a genotoxic agent.

2. Rule 2: If the smile string is not related to the genotoxicity, then the molecule is likely to be a non-genotoxic agent.

3. Rule 3: If the smile string is related to the genotoxicity, then the molecule is likely to be a genotoxic agent.
