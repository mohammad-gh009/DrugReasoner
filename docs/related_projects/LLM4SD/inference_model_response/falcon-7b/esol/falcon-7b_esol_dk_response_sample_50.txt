### Response:
The following data includes molecules and their corresponding value (the water solubility data/ ESOL value (log solubility in mols per litre)). Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict molecules ESOL value.

1. Logarithmic solubility (log solubility) is a measure of the amount of a substance that can dissolve in water. The higher the log solubility value, the more soluble the substance is in water. For example, water is a highly soluble substance, while oil is a non-soluble substance.

2. The water solubility of a molecule is related to its molecular structure. In general, the more polar and charged the molecule is, the more soluble it is in water.

3. The water solubility of a molecule is also related to its size. Smaller molecules are generally more soluble in water than larger molecules.

Based on these rules, the water solubility of a molecule can be predicted by looking at its log solubility value and molecular structure.

1. Rule 1: The water solubility of a molecule is directly proportional to the size of the molecule.

2. Rule 2: The water solubility of a molecule is inversely proportional to the size of the molecule.

3. Rule 3: The water solubility of a molecule is directly proportional to the electronegativity of the atom in the molecule.

1. Logarithm of the water solubility data (log solubility in mols per litre) is a good indicator of the water solubility of a molecule.
2. The higher the log solubility value, the more water soluble the molecule is.
3. The log solubility value can be used to predict the water solubility of a molecule.

1. Hydrophilic (polar) molecules tend to have higher water solubility values.
2. Non-polar (apolar) molecules tend to have lower water solubility values.
3. The more polar a molecule is, the more likely it is to have a higher water solubility value.
