 Here are three rules that can be used to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
1. The molecule has an androgen receptor binding affinity, indicating it may have hormone-like activity that can lead to adverse effects such as prostate enlargement and prostate cancer.
2. The molecule contains chloride ions, which are known to be toxic in large amounts and can cause adverse effects such as respiratory depression and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. The molecule has a high octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow), indicating it is lipophilic and can easily cross cell membranes, potentially leading to toxicity and adverse effects.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred based on the data to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. A molecule with a positive value for the "Toxicity activity of a molecule against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway" label is likely to have adverse effects related to androgen receptor activity.
2. A molecule with a positive value for the "Toxicity activity of a molecule against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway" label and a negative value for the "Toxicity activity of a molecule against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway" label with the same Smiles string is likely to have adverse effects related to androgen receptor activity.
3. A molecule with a negative value for the "Toxicity activity of a molecule against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway" label is likely to be less likely to have adverse effects related to androgen receptor activity.

================================

 Here are three rules that can help predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
1. A molecule with halogenation (chlorination or bromination) at the benzene ring of an aromatic compound can have adverse effects.
2. A molecule with aromatic amines can have adverse effects, especially if the amino group is para to an aromatic ring.
3. A molecule with aromatic rings fused to an aromatic system (such as naphthalenes or anthracenes) can have adverse effects.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with certain functional groups or structural characteristics that are known to be toxic against androgen receptor will have a value of 1 in the dataset, while those that do not have such characteristics will have a value of 0.
Examples:
* Molecules containing thallium or heavy metals will have a value of 1, as they are known to be toxic.
* Molecules containing halogenated aromatic compounds or chlorinated hydrocarbons will have a value of 1, as they are known to be toxic.
* Molecules containing certain organic solvents or chemicals used in industry will have a value of 1, as they are known to be toxic.
* Molecules containing formaldehyde or other aldehydes will have a value of 1, as they are known to be toxic.
* Molecules containing certain pesticides or herbicides will have a value of 1, as they are known to be toxic.
* Molecules containing certain plastics or synthetic polymers will have a value of 1, as they are known to be toxic.
Rule 2: Molecules with certain functional groups or structural characteristics that are known to be safe against androgen receptor will have a value of 0 in the dataset.

Rule 3: Molecules with certain structural features that are known to increase the likelihood of toxicity against androgen receptor will

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects based on its structure/properties:
1. The presence of halogens (especially chlorine and bromine) in certain positions of an aromatic ring can increase the likelihood of toxicity activity. This is because halogens can enhance the lipophilicity of the molecule, which can lead to increased accumulation in tissues and potential toxicity. For example, the smiles string Nc1ccc(Br)cc1CN[C@H]1CC[C@H](O)CC1 is labeled as 1 for toxicity activity against the androgen receptor.
2. The presence of multiple aromatic rings or conjugated systems can also increase the likelihood of toxicity activity. This is because these systems can have high affinities for cellular targets, leading to potential toxicity. For example, the smiles string C=CCC#N is labeled as 0 for lack of toxicity activity against the androgen receptor.
3. The presence of certain functional groups, such as amines, alcohols, and carboxylic acids, can also affect the toxicity activity of a molecule. For example, amino groups can have high affinity for cellular targets and can lead to potential toxicity. Additionally, carboxylic acid groups can have low membrane permeability, which can limit toxicity. It is important to consider the overall structure and properties of the molecule when evaluating its potential toxicity.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with halogen atoms or aromatic rings are more likely to have adverse effects.
 Rule 2: Molecules with double or triple bonds in their structure are more likely to have adverse effects.
 Rule 3: Molecules that contain functional groups commonly found in known toxins are more likely to have adverse effects.

================================

 Sure, here are three rules that can be used to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
1. The molecule should have an atomic number larger than 40 and be able to form covalent bonds with other molecules. This can help predict if a molecule has enough stability to cause adverse effects in the body.
2. The molecule should contain aromatic rings, double bonds, or triple bonds, which can increase its reactivity and potential toxicity.
3. The molecule should have functional groups such as amines, alcohols, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, or halides, which can interact with biological systems and cause adverse effects.

================================

 To come up with three rules that predict whether a molecule can cause adverse effects based on its properties/structures, we can start by analyzing the smiles strings in the dataset with known toxicity activity and toxicity inactivity. Here are three rules that seem to hold:
1. The presence of halogens (chlorine, bromine, and iodine) in certain positions or combinations seems to be correlated with toxicity. For example, the smiles string O=C1c2ccccc2C(=O)c2cc(S(=O)(=O)[O-])ccc21 has an anion with two iodine atoms in the 3- and 5-positions, which is predictive of toxicity. Similarly, O=[N+]([O-])c1cc(C(F)(F)F)c(Cl)c([N+](=O)[O-])c1Cl is also predictive of toxicity.
2. The presence of certain functional groups, such as \P(=O)(O)O, CCOC(=O)CC(C)(C)C(=O)OCCCCCC, or C#C[C@]1(O)CC[C@H]2[C@@H]3CCC4=CC(=O)CC[C@@H]4[C@H]3CC[C@@]21CC, appears to be correlated with toxicity. These functional groups often indicate the presence of certain metals or metal complexes that can have adverse effects.
3. Certain molecular shapes or topologies, such as the linear structure of C=CCc1ccc2c(c1)OCO2 or the branched structure of CCCCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1OC, seem to be correlated with toxicity. These structures may indicate the presence of certain moieties or functional groups that are known to be toxic.
It's important to note that these rules are based on a limited set of data and may not hold true for all molecules. Additionally, the toxicity of a molecule can be influenced by many factors, including its dose, route of administration, and target tissue. Therefore, it's always important to consider other factors when evaluating the potential toxicity of a molecule.

================================

 To come up with rules that predict whether a molecule can cause adverse effects based on its structure, we can start by analyzing the data and looking for patterns. Here are three rules that may help:

1. The presence of certain functional groups or motifs can indicate potential toxicity. For example, molecules containing chlorinated aromatic rings, such as biphenyls, often show higher toxicity activity. Similarly, the presence of phosphate or carboxylic acid groups may also be indicative of toxicity.
2. Molecular properties such as lipophilicity, solubility, and molecular weight can also impact toxicity. For instance, highly lipophilic molecules tend to have higher uptake in cells and tissues, which can lead to increased toxicity. On the other hand, very large molecules may be too large to penetrate cells effectively, which can reduce their toxicity.
3. The presence of certain heavy metals or metal complexes, such as aluminum, vanadium, or arsenic, can also indicate potential toxicity. These elements can be found in various molecules, including some food additives, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be used to predict whether a molecule is capable of causing adverse effects:
1. The molecule should contain aromatic amines: Aromatic amines are known to be carcinogenic and can cause adverse effects such as birth defects, liver damage, and respiratory problems.
2. The molecule should have a high lipophilicity: Lipophilic molecules tend to accumulate in tissues and organs, leading to long-term exposure and potential toxicity. These molecules can also disrupt cell membranes, causing damage to cells and tissues.
3. The molecule should contain halogens: Halogenated compounds, especially chlorinated and brominated compounds, are often used as pesticides and industrial chemicals. These compounds can be persistent in the environment and can accumulate in living organisms, leading to toxicity and other adverse effects.

================================

 Here are three possible rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. The presence of halogen atoms (such as chlorine or bromine) in a molecule is often associated with adverse effects. For example, the smiles strings CCCCOc1cc(C(=O)NCCN(CC)CC)c2ccccc2n1, CCCCCCOC(=O)c1cccnc1, and Cc1cccc(CN2CCN(C(c3ccccc3)c3ccc(Cl)cc3)CC2)c1 all contain halogenated groups.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings can also be associated with adverse effects. The smiles strings CCCc1ccc(C(=O)O)cc1, O=C(O)CCS, and C=CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC all contain aromatic rings.
3. The presence of certain functional groups, such as the androgen receptor agonist group "Cc1ccc(C)c(O)c1", the phosphorothioate group "OP(=S)(OCC)SCn1nnc2ccccc2c1=O", and the organic phosphate group "O=P([O-])(O)C(Sc1ccc(Cl)cc1)P(=O)([O-])O" can also be associated with adverse effects.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be used to predict whether a molecule is capable of causing adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
1. The presence of chlorinated organic compounds: Molecules that contain chlorinated organic compounds, such as trichloroethylene or dichlorobenzene, are more likely to have adverse effects. The chlorine atoms in these compounds can make them more toxic and persistent in the environment.
2. The presence of aromatic amines: Aromatic amines, such as aniline or N,N-diethylaniline, can be toxic to humans and have been linked to various types of cancers. These compounds are often used as dyes, solvents, or pesticides.
3. The presence of heavy metals: Heavy metals like lead, mercury, and cadmium can accumulate in the body and cause a range of health problems, including developmental disorders, nervous system damage, and cancer. These metals can be found in air, water, and food, but also in certain cosmetics, jewelry, and electronics.

================================

 Here are three rules that can help predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. The presence of halogens (chlorine, bromine, and iodine) in a molecule often increases its toxicity. This is because halogens can participate in reactions that create reactive radicals, which can damage cells and tissues.
2. Molecules with multiple aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds tend to be more toxic than those with fewer ring structures or single bonds. This is because these molecules can have higher affinities for biological targets, such as enzymes or receptors, which can lead to stronger and more harmful interactions.
3. The presence of certain functional groups, such as alcohols, ethers, carboxylic acids, and amines, can increase the toxicity of a molecule. This is because these groups can participate in reactions that create reactive intermediates, which can damage cells and tissues.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with halogenation (e.g. chlorination or bromination) in certain positions are more likely to be toxic against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic rings (especially benzene rings) and/or ring systems (e.g. naphthalenes) are more likely to be toxic against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
Rule 3: Molecules with amino groups and/or multiple bonds (e.g. C=C or C(=O)OC) are more likely to be toxic against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.

Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic amines or aromatic compounds with halogenation are more likely to have adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with acetamides, benzamides, or other aromatic amides are more likely to have adverse effects.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be used to predict if a molecule is likely to cause adverse effects based on its structure or properties:
1. If a molecule contains aromatic amines, it is likely to be toxic to the androgen receptor. This is because aromatic amines can bind to the androgen receptor and activate it, leading to the growth of cancer cells. Examples of such molecules include [DB01006] and [DB00503].
2. If a molecule contains chlorinated aromatic compounds, it is likely to be toxic to the androgen receptor. Chlorinated aromatic compounds can also bind to the androgen receptor and activate it, leading to the growth of cancer cells. Examples of such molecules include [DB00502] and [DB01200].
3. If a molecule is a heavy metal complex, it is likely to be toxic to the androgen receptor and other biological systems. Heavy metal complexes can cause a range of adverse effects, including DNA damage, oxidative stress, and cell death. Examples of such molecules include [DB00501] and [DB00504].

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict whether a molecule is capable of causing adverse effects:
1. The presence of halogens (chlorine, bromine, and fluorine) in a molecule increases its likelihood of being toxic. This is evident in molecules such as Cc1ccc(Cl)c(N)c1Cl, Nc1nc(N)nc(-c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl)n1, and O=C(O)c1ccc(S(=O)(=O)N(Cl)Cl)cc1. The more halogens present in a molecule, the greater the chance it has of causing adverse effects.
2. Molecules containing aromatic amines are more likely to be toxic. Examples of such molecules include Nc1nc(N)nc(-c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl)n1, CC[n+]1ccccc1, and CCC(Cc1c(I)cc(I)c(N)c1I). Aromatic amines are known to be carcinogenic and can cause a wide range of adverse effects.
3. The presence of certain functional groups, such as alcohols, ethers, and carbamates, in a molecule does not necessarily indicate toxicity. However, if these groups are attached to aromatic rings, the molecule's toxicity increases. For example, while CCOC(=O)c1ccc(S(=O)(=O)N(Cl)Cl)cc1 is not considered toxic, the presence of an ether group attached to a benzene ring in CCOC(=O)c1c(C)cc(O)c(C)c1O increases its toxicity.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. A molecule with an aromatic ring system, such as a benzene ring, is more likely to have adverse effects. This can be seen in the chemicals labeled as 1, such as [Hg+2], CC(CN1c2ccccc2Sc2ccccc21), and Cc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)O)cc1. The presence of multiple aromatic rings can increase the likelihood of adverse effects, as seen in Cc1cc(Cl)ccc1O.
2. Molecules with halogens, such as chlorine or bromine, are more likely to have adverse effects. This can be seen in the chemicals labeled as 1, such as CC(=O)CCC=C(C)C, N#CC(Br)(Br)C(N)=O, and Brc1cc(Oc2cc(Br)c(Br)c(Br)c2Br)c(Br)c(Br)c1Br. The presence of multiple halogens can increase the likelihood of adverse effects, as seen in COC(=O)NCCC[Si](OC)(OC)OC.
3. Molecules with unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds, such as in alkynes or alkenes, are more likely to have adverse effects. This can be seen in the chemicals labeled as 1, such as CC=CC=CCOC(=O)C(C)C, C=Cc1ccc(CCC=O)cc1, and CCC(=O)c1cccnc1. The presence of multiple unsaturated bonds can increase the likelihood of adverse effects, as seen in CC(C)(C)C(=O)CCc1ccc(Cl)cc1.

================================

 There are three possible ways to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. Toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway. Molecules that have this property will have a value of 1 in the "toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway" column.
2. Presence of certain functional groups or structural features. For example, molecules with benzene ring or multiple bromines are more likely to be toxic. Molecules that have these features will have a value of 1 in the corresponding row of the "Functional Groups or Structural Features" column.
3. Physicochemical properties such as log P (logarithm of the octanol-water partition coefficient), molecular weight, and number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. Molecules with certain physicochemical properties are more likely to be toxic. Molecules that have these properties will have a value of 1 in the corresponding row of the "Physicochemical Properties" column.

================================

 Here are three rules that can help predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
1. If a molecule has a chloride ion binding site or an androgen receptor binding site, it is more likely to have adverse effects. For example, 17beta-hydroxyandrostanolone and testosterone bind to the androgen receptor and have been associated with negative side effects such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and breast cancer. Similarly, chlorinated compounds like DDT and dioxins bind to chloride channels and receptors, leading to toxic effects on the nervous system and other organs.
2. If a molecule is highly reactive or unstable, it is more likely to have adverse effects. For example, formaldehyde is known to be carcinogenic and can cause respiratory issues such as asthma. Likewise, N-nitrosamines are unstable and can form DNA-damaging free radicals, leading to an increased risk of cancer.
3. If a molecule has multiple aromatic rings or aromatic amines, it is more likely to have adverse effects. Aromatic compounds tend to be more hydrophobic and can accumulate in fatty tissues, leading to long-term toxicity. In addition, aromatic amines can be metabolized to formylketones and reactive electrophiles, which can covalently bind to DNA and proteins, leading to toxicity and mutagenicity. Examples of such molecules include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and bisphenol A (BPA).

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with halogens, particularly chlorine, in their structure are more likely to have adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic rings in their structure are more likely to have adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with hydroxyl or amino groups in their structure are less likely to have adverse effects.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be used to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects based on its structure/properties:
1. The molecule should contain aromatic amines, as these can be metabolized to aryl hydrocarbons that are known to be carcinogenic. For example, molecules with structures like R-NH2, where R is an aromatic group, may be carcinogenic.
2. The molecule should contain organic compounds with high reactive potential, such as those containing multiple halogens or aromatic rings. These types of molecules are more likely to undergo reactive metabolism and produce reactive intermediates that can damage cells and lead to adverse effects. For example, molecules with structures like C6H5X, where X is a halogen, may be more likely to cause adverse effects.
3. The molecule should contain compounds that can bind to and activate nuclear receptors, such as the androgen receptor or the estrogen receptor. These receptors are involved in a wide range of physiological processes, and activation of these receptors by xenobiotic chemicals can lead to adverse effects. For example, molecules that contain steroidal structures like testosterone or estradiol may be more likely to activate these receptors and cause adverse effects.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three possible rules that can be inferred to predict whether a molecule is capable of causing adverse effects:
1. The presence of halogens (chlorine, bromine, and iodine) in a molecule seems to increase the likelihood of it causing adverse effects. For example, molecules such as Nc1cccnc1, O=[N+]([O-])c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1, and CCCCCCOC(=O)CSCC all contain halogens and are labeled as 1 for toxicity activity against the androgen receptor.
2. The presence of aromatic amines in a molecule appears to be correlated with toxicity activity. For instance, molecules such as Nc1ccc(N)c2ccccc12 and CN[C@H]1CC[C@@H](c2ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c2)c2ccccc21 are labeled as 1 for toxicity activity against the androgen receptor.
3. The presence of specific functional groups, such as thiocarbonyl groups, aromatic rings, and acetyl groups, seems to increase the likelihood of a molecule causing adverse effects. For example, molecules such as Cc1ccc(C)c(O)c1, C=CCCCCCCCCOC(C)=O, and CC(Cc1ccc(O)cc1)NCC(O)c1cc(O)cc(O)c1 are all labeled as 1 for toxicity activity against the androgen receptor and contain one or more of these functional groups.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be used to predict if a molecule may have adverse effects based on its structure or properties:
1. The molecule has an androgen receptor binding affinity, indicating it may have hormone-like effects.
2. The molecule has a positive ionizable group, such as an amino or mercapto group, at a low pH, indicating it may be protonated and thereby have a different pharmacological profile.
3. The molecule is a planar aromatic compound or a heterocyclic compound with fused rings, indicating it may have a higher tendency to bind to biological macromolecules and potentially interfere with their function.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. If a molecule has an aromatic amine moiety with a substituted aniline, it may have adverse effects. For example, Nc1ccccc1-c1ccccc1 is labeled as 0, indicating that it can cause adverse effects.
2. If a molecule has a halogenated aromatic ring, it may have adverse effects. For example, Cc1cc(Cl)c(C)cc1Cl and Clc1ccc(C(Cl)(Cl)Cl)cc1 are labeled as 0, indicating that they can cause adverse effects.
3. If a molecule has an aromatic ketone or aldehyde with a substituted benzene ring, it may have adverse effects. For example, O=C(c1ccccc1)c1cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccc1Cl and O=C(Cn1c(=O)sc2ccc(Cl)cc21)c1cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccc1Cl are labeled as 1, indicating that they are likely to cause adverse effects.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with an aromatic amine group have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic ketones are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with long carbon chains and unsaturated bonds are more likely to cause adverse effects.

================================

 Here are three possible rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. The presence of halogens, especially chlorine and bromine, in the structure of a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects. This is evident from the presence of several molecules such as 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,4,6-tribromophenol, and 2,4-dibromophenol in the list of molecules that cause adverse effects.
2. The presence of aromatic rings in the structure of a molecule can also increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. Aromatic rings are commonly found in molecules that are known to cause adverse effects, such as in the case of benzene, which is a known carcinogen.
3. The presence of certain functional groups in the structure of a molecule, such as the amide group, the sulfone group, and the nitrile group, can also increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. These groups are commonly found in molecules that are known to cause adverse effects, such as in the case of acrylamide, which is a neurotoxin.

================================

 As a very experienced chemist, based on my knowledge and experience, I can infer three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it can cause adverse effects:
1. The presence of halogens (such as chlorine, bromine, and iodine) in a molecule increases its toxicity.
2. The presence of aromatic amines in a molecule may increase its carcinogenic potential.
3. The presence of certain functional groups such as nitro groups, epoxides, and certain metal coordination complexes can increase the toxicity of a molecule.

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the data to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. A molecule with a positively charged nitrogen atom next to an aromatic ring is more likely to be toxic. This can be seen in the smiles strings for [O-][n+]1ccccc1[S-], CCOC(=O)[N-]c1c[n+](N2CCOCC2)no1, and CN1CCOCC1c1ccccc1. The first two have a positively charged nitrogen atom next to an aromatic ring, while the third has a positively charged nitrogen atom in the same position as an aromatic ring.
2. A molecule with an aromatic ring that is highly substituted with electron-withdrawing groups is more likely to be toxic. This can be seen in the smiles strings for C=CCC1(C(C)CCC)C(=O)N=C([S-])NC1=O, C=C[Si](OC(=C)C)(OC(=C)C)OC(=C)C, and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1nc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl. All three molecules have highly substituted aromatic rings.
3. A molecule with a polar bond such as a carboxylic acid or alcohol is more likely to be toxic. This can be seen in the smiles strings for CCCCCCCOC(C)=O, C=CCC1(C(C)CCC)C(=O)N=C([S-])NC1=O, and O=[N+]([O-])c1ccc(O)c([N+](=O)[O-])c1. All three molecules have polar bonds.

================================

 Here are three possible rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. The presence of a carbonyl group in the molecule can indicate that it may have some toxicity activity. For example, CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(C)C shows high toxicity activity against the androgen receptor.
2. The presence of aromatic rings in the molecule can also indicate toxicity activity. For instance, Cc1ccccc1O and Cc1ccc2c(c1)OCO2 are both associated with toxicity activity.
3. The presence of certain functional groups, such as amino groups or halogens, can also indicate potential toxicity activity. For example, N[C@H](Cc1c[nH]c2ccccc12)C(=O)O and NC(=O)[C@@H]1C[C@]2(NC(=O)NC2=O)c2cc(F)ccc2O1 both contain amino groups and are associated with toxicity activity.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given smiles strings and their corresponding toxicity labels:
1. A molecule with an aromatic ketone group in the presence of an aromatic hydrocarbon or aromatic amine is more likely to be toxic.
For example, CCC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 and Nc1ccccc1Nc1ccccc1 both have aromatic ketone groups and are labeled as 0 (not toxic). On the other hand, CCc1cccc(CC)c1NC(=O)CN(CC(=O)O)CC(=O)O has an aromatic ketone group in the presence of an aromatic amine and is labeled as 1 (toxic).
2. A molecule with a chlorinated aromatic ring is more likely to be toxic.

3. A molecule with a positively charged nitrogen atom in the presence of an aromatic amine is more likely to be toxic.
For example, CN(C)CC[C@@H](c1ccc(Br)cc1)c1ccccn1 has a positively charged nitrogen atom in the presence of an aromatic amine and is labeled as 1 (toxic). On the other hand, CCC(=O)[O-].[K+] has a positively charged nitrogen atom in the presence of an aromatic amine but is overall neutral and is labeled as 0 (not toxic).

================================

 Here are three rules that can be used to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects based on its structure or properties:
1. The presence of certain functional groups or moieties can indicate potential toxicity. For example, the presence of chlorinated aromatic compounds, amino-substituted aromatics, or aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups can be indicative of potential toxicity.
2. The molecular weight and size of a molecule can also influence its potential toxicity. Generally, larger molecules tend to have higher affinity for biological targets and can be more toxic. Additionally, molecules with hydrophobic character or high LogP values (indicative of their partitioning in hydrophobic media such as cell membranes) tend to have higher toxicity.
3. Finally, the presence of specific atom types or bonds can also influence the toxicity of a molecule. For example, the presence of heavy metals, nitro compounds, or epoxides can be indicative of potential toxicity.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be used to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. The presence of halogen atoms (chlorine, bromine, and fluorine) in a molecule increases the likelihood of it causing adverse effects. The more halogen atoms a molecule has, the higher the chance it will be toxic.
2. Molecules with aromatic amines or nitriles are more likely to cause adverse effects than those without. The presence of these functional groups in a molecule can make it more carcinogenic or mutagenic.
3. The presence of aromatic compounds with more than one benzene ring increase the likelihood of a molecule causing adverse effects. The more rings a molecule has, the greater the chance it will be toxic.

================================

 Here are three possible rules that can be inferred based on the given data:
1. A molecule with an aromatic amine group (Nc1ccccc1) in its structure is more likely to have androgen receptor activity and cause adverse effects.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings that contain chlorine atoms (Clc1ccc2c(c1)CCc1cccnc1C2=C1CCNCC1) or iodine atoms (O=C(O)Cc1cc(I)c(Oc2cc(I)c(O)c(I)c2)c(I)c1) are more likely to have androgen receptor activity and cause adverse effects.
3. Molecules with thiophosphate groups (CSc1nc(Cl)nc(NC(C)C)n1) or organic phosphates (CCOP(=O)(OCC)Oc1nc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl) in their structures are more likely to have androgen receptor activity and cause adverse effects.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with planar aromatic systems and/or multiple halogenations are more likely to be associated with adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules with hydroxy or amino groups in close proximity to an aromatic ring or multiple aromatic rings are more likely to be associated with adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with electron-deficient double or triple bonds and/or aromatic rings proximal to positively-charged nitrogen atoms are more likely to be associated with adverse effects.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be used to predict if a molecule will have an adverse effect:
1. The molecule should contain functional groups that are known to be toxic, such as benzene ring, nitro groups, or acetamide.
2. The molecule should have a high lipophilicity, as log P (logarithm of the partition coefficient) greater than 5 is an indication of potential toxicity.
3. The molecule should have structural similarity to known toxins or ligands for nuclear receptors involved in xenobiotic metabolism, such as the androgen receptor, the estrogen receptor, or the pregnane X receptor.

================================

 To come up with rules that predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects, we can use the following steps:
1. Define a set of training data that includes both active (toxic) and inactive (non-toxic) molecules.
2. Preprocess the data by removing any unnecessary information such as salt atoms, isotopes, and unneeded elements.
3. Extract relevant features from the remaining molecules, such as functional groups, structural properties, and physicochemical properties. These features should be informative and able to differentiate active from inactive molecules.
4. Use machine learning algorithms to build a classification model that can predict if a new molecule is active (toxic) or inactive (non-toxic). Some popular algorithms for this purpose are logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
5. Evaluate the performance of the model using cross-validation techniques such as k-fold cross-validation and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).
6. Fine-tune the model by adjusting its hyperparameters and using feature selection techniques to improve its performance.
7. Finally, use the trained model to predict if a new molecule is likely to be active (toxic) or inactive (non-toxic).

================================

 Rule 1: A molecule with a chlorinated aromatic ring or an aromatic ring with multiple halogens is more likely to have adverse effects.
Rule 2: A molecule with a carbonyl group, an aromatic ring, and an organic sulfide is more likely to have adverse effects.
Rule 3: A molecule with a high number of halogen atoms or aromatic rings is more likely to have adverse effects.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with halogens (especially chlorine and bromine) or certain heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, and mercury in their structure are more likely to be toxic.
Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic rings or multiple bonds are more likely to be toxic.
Rule 3: Molecules with hydroxyl or amino groups in their structure are less likely to be toxic.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. If a molecule has a chlorinated aromatic ring or a brominated aromatic ring, it is likely to have adverse effects. This is indicated by the smiles strings 'Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl' and 'Nc1ccc(Br)cc1' having a value of 0.0 for toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
2. If a molecule has an acetylated aromatic amine, it is likely to have adverse effects. This is indicated by the smiles string 'CC(=O)Nc1ccc2c(c1)Cc1ccccc1-2' having a value of 0.0 for toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
3. If a molecule has aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups such as fluorine, nitro, or cyano groups, it is likely to have adverse effects. This is indicated by the smiles strings 'Cc1ccnc(NS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(N)cc2)n1', 'Nc1ccc(Br)cc1', and 'N#Cc1ccc(CC(=O)c2cccc(C(F)(F)F)c2)cc1' having a value of 0.0 for toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred to predict if a molecule can cause an adverse effect:
1. Presence of halogens (chlorine, bromine, and fluorine) in the molecule can increase its toxicity. For example, molecules with multiple chlorine substituents on a benzene ring or with bromine atoms in a biphenyl moiety tend to have higher toxicity.
2. The presence of aromatic amines can also indicate potential toxicity. Amines can be irritants and can cause allergic reactions, and certain aromatic amines are known carcinogens.
3. The molecule's ability to bind to nuclear receptors, such as the androgen receptor, can also indicate its potential toxicity. Molecules that bind to nuclear receptors can interfere with normal cellular processes and cause adverse effects.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict whether a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. A molecule with aromatic amine groups (e.g., Nc1ccccc1) or any primary amino groups (NH2) is more likely to be toxic. This is based on the observation that several molecules with these functional groups are labeled as 1 for toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
2. A molecule with aromatic rings (especially those containing halogens such as chlorine, bromine, and iodine) is more likely to be toxic. This is based on the observation that several molecules with aromatic rings are labeled as 1 for toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
3. A molecule with organic heterotricyclic compounds (e.g., [nH]c1ccccc1) is more likely to be toxic. This is based on the observation that several molecules with organic heterotricyclic compounds are labeled as 1 for toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.

================================

 Here are three possible rules that can be used to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects based on its structure or properties:
1. The molecule has a halogenated aromatic ring or multiple chloro groups, which are known to be harmful to the environment and living organisms. For example, the molecule N#Cc1ccc(CC(=O)c2cccc(C(F)(F)F)c2)cc1 has multiple chloro groups that could be harmful.
2. The molecule has a nitro group (-N=[N+]([O-])), which is a strong oxidant and can cause tissue damage and inflammation. For example, the molecule N#Cc1nc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has three nitro groups that could be harmful.
3. The molecule has an organic phosphate group, which can interfere with cellular signaling and cause toxic effects. For example, the molecule CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C has an organic phosphate group that could be harmful.
It's important to note that these rules are not exhaustive and other factors such as the molecular weight, solubility, and reactivity could also contribute to the toxicity of a molecule. Therefore, it's important to consider multiple factors when assessing the potential toxicity of a molecule.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. The presence of planar aromatic rings with chlorine substituents in the molecule increases the likelihood of it being toxic. For example, N#C/C(N)=C(/N)C#N has two chlorine substituents on a planar aromatic ring and is labeled as 1.0 for toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
2. Molecules with a high number of chlorine substituents are more likely to be toxic. For example, Cl[C@H]1[C@H](Cl)[C@@H](Cl)[C@H](Cl)[C@@H](Cl)[C@@H]1Cl has six chlorine substituents and is labeled as 0.0 for toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway.
3. The presence of certain functional groups, such as nitro groups, amino groups, and carbonyl groups, in specific positions in the molecule can increase the likelihood of it being toxic. For example, CCN(CC)C(C)CN1c2ccccc2Sc2ccccc21 is labeled as 0.0 for toxicity activity against the androgen receptor in the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway, but it has multiple amino groups which are known to be toxic.

================================

 Here are three possible rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. A molecule with a positively charged nitrogen atom in a five-membered heterocyclic ring is more likely to cause adverse effects. This can be inferred from the smiles string 'Cc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])c(C)c1' having a label of 1 for toxicity activity.
2. A molecule with an aromatic amide group and a chlorine atom in the para position of the phenyl ring is more likely to cause adverse effects. This can be inferred from the smiles string 'NC(=O)c1ccccc1Cl' having a label of 1 for toxicity activity.
3. A molecule with a五員環維持基和一個負據陰性原子內的正據陰性原子之間的空間橢圓體结構是更可能導致不良反應。這可以通過雖有數據'Cc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])c(C)c1'有标筆1對毒性活性得出。
