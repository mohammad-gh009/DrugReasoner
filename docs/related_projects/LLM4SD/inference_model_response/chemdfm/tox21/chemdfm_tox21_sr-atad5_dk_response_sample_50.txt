 Here are three rules that can be used to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
1. The presence of an alkylating group or an arylating agent in a molecule's structure often indicates it has the potential to cause adverse effects. This is because these groups can react with DNA and other cellular components, leading to mutations and other forms of damage. Examples of alkylating groups include chloroethyl groups, while examples of arylating agents include aromatic amines.
2. The presence of certain heavy metals or metalloids in a molecule's structure can also indicate it has the potential to cause adverse effects. These elements can accumulate in the body and cause toxicity, particularly in organs like the kidneys and liver. Examples of heavy metals that can be found in molecules include lead, mercury, and arsenic.
3. The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule's structure, such as those involved in redox reactions or the formation of free radicals, can also indicate it has the potential to cause adverse effects. These groups can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other forms of oxidative stress, which can damage cellular components and lead to toxicity. Examples of such functional groups include aromatic hydrocarbons, organic peroxides, and nitro compounds.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with an aromatic amine group linked to an aromatic ring with an electron-withdrawing group such as a chlorine, bromine, or fluorine are more likely to have genotoxic activity.
Rule 2: Molecules with a terminal acetylenic group or an acyl chloride group are more likely to have genotoxic activity.
Rule 3: Molecules with a long hydrocarbon chain or a bulky alkyl group are less likely to have genotoxic activity.

================================

 1. Molecules with halogenated aromatic rings or nitrogen-containing aromatics tend to have higher toxicity activity.
2. Molecules with multiple aromatic rings or conjugated systems tend to have higher toxicity activity.
3. Molecules with hydrophobic alkyl chains or long carbon chains tend to have higher toxicity activity.

================================

 Rule 1: A molecule is predictive of an adverse effect if it has a positively charged nitrogen atom in the structure.
Rule 2: A molecule is predictive of an adverse effect if it contains a benzene ring fused to a five-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and an amine group.
Rule 3: A molecule is predictive of an adverse effect if it contains an aromatic ring with a chlorine atom attached to it.

================================

 Here are three possible rules that can be used to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
1. The presence of certain functional groups or moieties: Certain functional groups or moieties are known to be toxic and can cause adverse effects. For example, the presence of aromatic amines, especially those with halogen substituents, can be indicative of potential carcinogenicity. Similarly, the presence of certain metal ions or heavy metals, such as lead, mercury, or arsenic, can also be toxic and cause adverse effects.
2. Physicochemical properties of the molecule: Certain physicochemical properties of the molecule, such as solubility, Log P (logarithm of the partition coefficient), and molecular weight, can also be indicative of potential toxicity. For example, highly lipophilic molecules with high Log P values tend to accumulate in tissues and organs, which can lead to toxicity. Similarly, molecules that are insoluble in water or have low solubility can also be difficult for the body to metabolize and eliminate, which can also lead to toxicity.
3. The presence of structural similarities with known toxicants: If a molecule structurally resembles a known toxicant, it is likely to have similar toxicological profiles. For example, if a molecule contains a benzene ring, it may be more likely to be a carcinogen if it is substituted with certain halogens or other known toxicants. Similarly, if a molecule contains a specific functional group, such as an alkylating agent, it is more likely to be toxic and cause adverse effects.

================================

 Based on the smiles strings labeled as 1, which are related to toxicity activity of a molecule against the genotoxicity indicated by ATAD5 in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway, the following 3 rules can be inferred to predict whether a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. A molecule with aromatic amines or aryl halides is likely to be genotoxic and thus carries the risk of causing adverse effects.
2. Molecules with multiple halogens or chlorines are more likely to be genotoxic and cause adverse effects.
3. Molecules with acetate or carbonate esters, or those containing the functionality "OCCOCCN1CCN(C2=Nc3ccccc3Sc3ccccc32)" are less likely to be genotoxic and carry a lower risk of causing adverse effects.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. If a molecule contains an aromatic ring with a chlorine atom attached to it, it has a higher chance of being toxic. This is based on the smiles strings of Cc1ccc2c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(O)c2n1 and Cc1ncc(C[n+]2csc(CCOP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)O)c2C)c(N)n1 which are labeled as 1 and have a value of 1, indicating they are toxic.
2. If a molecule contains a member of the class of benzoins or benzoates, it has a higher chance of being toxic. This is based on the smiles string of COC(=O)c1cccc(Cl)c1 which is labeled as 1 and has a value of 1, indicating it is toxic.
3. If a molecule contains an aromatic ring with an amino group attached to it, it has a lower chance of being toxic. This is based on the smiles string of CN(C)C=Nc1c(I)cc(I)c(CCC(=O)[O-])c1I which is labeled as 0 and has a value of 0, indicating it is not toxic.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be used to predict if a molecule is capable of causing adverse effects based on its structure/properties:
1. The presence of an aldehyde group (-CHO) is a good indication that the molecule can cause adverse effects. Aldehydes are generally irritants and can react with biological molecules to form toxic products.
2. The presence of aromatic amines is also a good indication that the molecule may be capable of causing adverse effects. Aromatic amines can be protonated to form positively charged species, which can react with negatively charged biological molecules such as DNA.
3. The presence of aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups such as chlorines or nitro groups is also a good indication that the molecule may be capable of causing adverse effects. These groups can increase the reactivity of the aromatic ring, allowing it to react with biological molecules.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. If a molecule has a smiles string related to toxicity activity of a molecule against the genotoxicity indicated by ATAD5 in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway, then it is likely to cause adverse effects.
2. If a molecule contains a carbonyl group, an aromatic ring, or a heterocyclic ring, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects.
3. If a molecule is able to form reactive oxygen species (ROS), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. Aromatic amines with an amino group in the para position to a nitro group are likely to be toxic. For example, Cc1ccnc(N)c1 is related to toxicity activity against the genotoxicity indicated by ATAD5 in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
2. Molecules that contain aromatic rings with chlorine substituents in the meta or para positions, or with multiple chlorine substituents, are likely to be toxic. For example, Cc1cccc(Cl)c1NC(=O)CCC(C)(C)O is related to toxicity activity against the genotoxicity indicated by ATAD5 in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.
3. Molecules that contain aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro, cyano, or carboxamido groups in the para position are likely to be toxic. For example, N#CC(C)(C)O is related to toxicity activity against the genotoxicity indicated by ATAD5 in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be used to predict whether a molecule is capable of causing adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
1. The presence of chlorinated aromatic compounds: Molecules containing chlorinated aromatic compounds, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorobenzenes, are more likely to be toxic. These compounds tend to bioaccumulate and can cause a wide range of adverse effects, including cancer, reproductive and developmental toxicity, and neurotoxicity.
2. The presence of polar functional groups: Molecules with polar functional groups, such as hydroxyl groups (-OH) and carboxyl groups (-COOH), tend to be more water-soluble and can have increased affinity for biological membranes. This increased affinity can lead to greater toxicity, as these molecules can more easily enter and interact with cells.
3. The presence of reactive electrophiles: Molecules containing reactive electrophiles, such as aldehydes and ketones, can react with and modify cellular macromolecules, such as DNA and proteins. These modifications can lead to a wide range of adverse effects, including genotoxicity and cytotoxicity. Molecules containing electrophilic aromatic compounds, such as aromatic ketones and nitroaromatics, are particularly prone to causing adverse effects.

================================

 To come up with the rules, I will look at the smiles strings that are labeled as 1 (related to toxicity activity of a molecule against the genotoxicity indicated by ATAD5 in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway) and those labeled as 0 (not related). I will analyze the structural features of the molecules that are common among the 1 labels and those that are common among the 0 labels. From there, I will be able to infer the rules that directly relate the structures of a molecule to its toxicity activity.

================================

 Based on the smiles strings provided, it seems that the main structural features associated with genotoxicity indicate by ATAD5 in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway are halogenation, aromatic systems, and presence of ring structures.
Toxic molecules tend to have more halogens,尤其是氯和溴，这些卤素通常与碳和氢原子结合，导致分子的极性和反应活性增加。此外，许多有害化合物具有芳香环结构，这种结构通常具有共轭系统和较高的电子密度，可以增强分子间的相互作用和反应性。还观察到许多有害分子具有多个环状结构，这些结构可以增加分子的极性和稳定性，从而影响分子的生物学效应。
因此，以下是三个规则，可以根据分子结构预测其是否会对ATAD5在SR信号通路中的基因毒性产生影响：
1. 分子中含有大量卤素，尤其是氯和溴，这可能会增加分子的反应活性和极性，从而增加其对ATAD5在SR信号通路中的基因毒性的贡献。
2. 分子中包含芳香环结构或多个环状结构，这可能会增加分子的极性和稳定性，从而影响其与ATAD5在SR信号通路中的相互作用和反应活性。
3. 分子中存在侧链或取代基，这可能会增加分子的极性和反应活性，从而影响其对ATAD5在SR信号通路中的基因毒性的贡献。

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. The presence of certain functional groups or atoms can indicate potential toxicity. For example, the presence of halogens (chlorine, bromine, and fluorine) or heavy metals (such as lead, mercury, and arsenic) can be a sign of potential toxicity. Similarly, the presence of certain functional groups such as amines, ethers, thiols, and acids can also indicate potential toxicity.
2. The molecular size and shape can also influence toxicity. Generally, larger molecules tend to have higher toxicity due to their ability to bind to multiple targets and their difficulty in being eliminated from the body. However, smaller molecules may also be toxic if they are able to cross biological barriers and interfere with essential biochemical processes.
3. The presence of specific chemical structural features can also indicate potential toxicity. For example, the presence of aromatic rings, amide bonds, or heterocyclic rings can indicate potential toxicity due to their ability to interact with cellular machinery and disrupt essential biochemical processes. Additionally, the presence of multiple halogens or other reactive groups can also increase the toxicity of a molecule.

================================

 Here are three possible rules based on the provided data:

1. A molecule with an aromatic ring (such as benzene) in its structure is more likely to be toxic. This can be indicated by the presence of a ring with at least six carbon atoms that is not bonded to any other groups except for some hydrocarbons.

2. A molecule containing halogens, particularly chlorine and bromine, is more likely to be toxic. This can be indicated by the presence of halogen atoms in the structure of the molecule.

3. A molecule with a high number of atoms or a large molecular weight is more likely to be toxic. This can be indicated by the number of atoms or the molecular weight of the molecule being above a certain threshold value.

================================

 Here are three possible rules to predict if a molecule can cause an adverse effect based on its structure and properties:
1. A molecule with halogenated aromatic rings or those containing chloroamino groups is more likely to have adverse effects. This is because halogens and chloroamino groups can increase the reactivity of a molecule and make it more toxic.
2. Molecules with multiple aromatic rings or those containing nitro groups are also more likely to be toxic. These groups can increase the lipophilicity of a molecule, allowing it to more easily cross biological membranes and interact with cellular targets.
3. The presence of specific functional groups, such as those containing heavy metals, can also indicate that a molecule is likely to be toxic. For example, molecules containing lead, mercury, or arsenic atoms are known to be highly toxic and can cause severe health problems.

================================

 Here are three possible rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. Molecules with a thiocarbonyl group (C(N)=S) at position 1 are more likely to be genotoxic. This rule is based on the fact that many of the molecules labeled as 1 (toxicity activity of a molecule against the genotoxicity indicated by ATAD5 in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway) contain a C(N)=S group, such as CN(C)C(=S)SC(=S)N(C)C and CCCc1cc(C(N)=S)ccn1. The presence of this group may indicate that the molecule has electrophilic properties, which can react with DNA and cause genotoxicity.
2. Molecules with an aromatic amine group (Nc1ccccc1) are less likely to be genotoxic. This rule is based on the fact that many of the molecules labeled as 0 (not genotoxic) do not contain an aromatic amine group, such as CCOc1ccc(C[C@H]2NC(=O)CCSSC[C@@H](C(=O)N3CCC[C@H]3C(=O)N[C@@H](CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)NCC(N)=O)NC(=O)[C@H](CC(N)=O)NC(=O)[C@H](CO)NC(=O)[C@H](Cc1ccc(O)cc1)NC(=O)[C@H](Cc1c[nH]cn1)NC(=O)[C@@H]1CCC(=O)N1)C(=O)N[C@@H](CCCNC(=N)N)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)NNC(N)=O. The presence of an aromatic amine group may increase the molecule's reactivity and ability to bind to DNA, leading to genotoxicity.

3. The presence of certain functional groups, such as aminoxyl groups and organic peroxides, is generally associated with high toxicity activity against the genotoxicity indicated by ATAD5 in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway. For example, S=C1NC=NC2N=CNC12 has a label of 0.0, indicating high toxicity activity, while C=CC[N+](C)(C)CC=C has a label of 0, indicating low toxicity activity.

================================

 Here are three potential rules that can be used to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
1. If a molecule contains an acrylamide group (-C=CC(N)=O), it is likely to be toxic and cause adverse effects. This group is known to form covalent adducts with DNA and proteins, leading to genotoxic and carcinogenic effects.
2. If a molecule contains a chlorinated aromatic ring, it is more likely to be toxic and cause adverse effects. Chlorinated aromatics are often used as pesticides and industrial chemicals, and are known to bioaccumulate and cause endocrine disruption, developmental toxicity, and cancer.
3. If a molecule is positively charged and has a bulky structure, it is more likely to be toxic and cause adverse effects. Positive charges can interact with negative charges on biological molecules, causing electrostatic repulsion and membrane disruption. Bulky structures can hinder the binding of a molecule to its target receptor, leading to off-target effects and toxicity.

This can be detected using a substructure search or by examining the molecule for these specific functional groups.
2. Molecules with a high number of aromatic rings or double bonds tend to be more toxic. This can be due to their planar structure, which allows them to interact more easily with biological molecules and disrupt cellular processes. The presence of multiple aromatic rings or double bonds in a molecule can be identified using a substructure search or by examining the molecular formula for these functional groups.
3. Certain functional groups, such as amides, thiocarbamates, and organic sulfides, are known to be toxic and may contribute to the overall toxicity of a molecule. These functional groups can be identified using a substructure search or by examining the molecule for specific functional group symbols in its Smiles string.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be used to predict if a molecule is capable of causing adverse effects:

Rule 3: Molecules with a high number of heavy atoms are more likely to be toxic.

================================

 Here are three possible rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict if a molecule can cause an adverse effect:
1. The presence of an aromatic amine group (Nc1ccccc1) in a molecule may indicate potential toxicity activity, as it suggests the possibility of reactive electrophilic intermediates being formed upon metabolism. For example, molecules like CCCCCCCCCCCC[N+](C)(C)CCCS(=O)(=O)[O-], CCCCCCCCCCCCl, and CCCCCCCCCCC(C)C(=O)OCCCCCCCC(C)C all contain aromatic amine groups and are labeled as 1 for toxicity activity.
2. The presence of multiple halogenated aromatic rings (e.g., bromobenzenes, chlorobenzenes) in a molecule may also indicate potential toxicity activity, as halogenated aromatic compounds are commonly associated with environmental persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity. For example, molecules like Nc1c(Br)cc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1[N+](=O)[O-], CC1=C(C=O)C(C)(C)CC=C1, and C=C(C)C(=O)OCC all contain multiple halogenated aromatic rings and are labeled as 1 for toxicity activity.
3. The presence of aromatic ketones or aldehydes in a molecule may also indicate potential toxicity activity, as they can undergo reactive electrophilic addition reactions with biological macromolecules (e.g., DNA, proteins) and cause covalent modifications that lead to toxic effects. For example, molecules like CCCCCCCCCC(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(=O)O)C(=O)O, CCOC(=O)CC, and C=C(C)C(=O)OCC all contain aromatic ketones or aldehydes and are labeled as 1 for toxicity activity.

================================

 1. The presence of aromatic amines (e.g., anilines) in a molecule is a good indication that it is capable of causing adverse effects.
2. Molecules containing chlorinated aromatic compounds (e.g., dioxins and PCBs) are often associated with toxic activity.

 Based on the provided data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. The presence of certain functional groups or moieties, such as acrylamide, bromoacetate, and chloroacetate, can increase the likelihood of adverse effects.
2. Certain structural features, such as the presence of halogens or aromatic rings, can also be indicative of potential adverse effects.
3. The molecular weight and complexity of a molecule can also play a role in determining its potential for adverse effects, with larger and more complex molecules often being more likely to have adverse effects than smaller and simpler ones.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with aromatic amines may be toxic as they can be carcinogenic.
Rule 2: Molecules with organophosphates are potentially toxic as they can inhibit acetylcholinesterase, leading to neurotoxicity.
Rule 3: Molecules with halogens such as bromine, chlorine, and fluorine in their structure can be toxic as they can disrupt cellular processes and cause DNA damage.

================================

 Here are three rules that can help predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
1. The presence of halogens (e.g., chlorine, bromine) in certain positions or patterns can indicate potential toxicity. For example, if a molecule contains chlorine atoms in the para position of phenyl rings or if it has multiple bromine atoms on a benzene ring, it may be more likely to have adverse effects.
2. The molecular weight and size of a molecule can also be related to its toxicity. Generally, larger molecules tend to be more toxic than smaller ones. Additionally, molecules with more complex structures or a higher number of ring systems may be more likely to have adverse effects.
3. The presence of specific functional groups, such as amino groups, carboxy groups, or thiol groups, can also be indicative of potential toxicity. For example, molecules with amino groups may be more likely to be toxic if they have additional functionalities that can quaternize or react with other molecules. Similarly, molecules with carboxy groups may be more likely to have adverse effects if they can form reactive intermediates or undergo other chemical reactions.

================================

 Here are three possible rules based on the given data:

1. A molecule with a cationic structure, as indicated by a positive label (e.g. 1), is more likely to have adverse effects. This can be due to the potential for the molecule to bind and react with biological structures, which can lead to toxicity. For example, many of the cationic molecules in the list, such as [Pd+2], [C[N+](C)(C)CCOC(=O)CCC(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C], and [C[S+](C)CCC(N)C(=O)O], are known to be toxic to cells and organisms.
2. A molecule with an aromatic ring or multiple conjugated double bonds, as indicated by a label like "c1ccccc1" or "c1ccc2ccccc2c1", is more likely to have adverse effects. This is because these structures can increase the reactivity of the molecule and allow it to interact more readily with biological structures, potentially leading to toxicity. For example, many of the molecules with aromatic rings or multiple conjugated double bonds, such as benzoic acid, Nc1ccc2cc(S(=O)(=O)O)cc(O)c2c1, and C=C(C)C#N, are known to be toxic to cells and organisms.
3. A molecule with a sulfonamide group, as indicated by a label like "NS(=O)(=O)O" or "S(N)(=O)=O", is more likely to have adverse effects. This is because the sulfonamide group can mimic the action of endogenous compounds, such as hormones and neurotransmitters, which can lead to disruptions in biological processes and toxicity. For example, many of the molecules with a sulfonamide group, such as sulfanilamide, Nc1ccc(OC(=O)c2ccccc2OC(C)=O)cc1, and COCCOCCOCCOCS(=O)(=O)[O-], are known to be toxic to cells and organisms.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be used to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects based on its structure/properties:
1. If a molecule has an alkyl halide group like CCCCOCCCC, it is likely to have some toxicological activity, especially if it contains aromatic rings or other functional groups that can react with biological molecules.
2. If a molecule contains aromatic rings with chlorine substituents, it may have some toxicological activity due to the potential for the chlorine atoms to react with biological molecules and cause harm.
3. If a molecule contains an organosulfonate group like CCCCCCCCCSCO, it may have some toxicological activity, especially if it contains aromatic rings or other functional groups that can react with biological molecules. Organosulfonates are commonly found in detergents and surfactants and can have adverse effects on the environment and human health.

================================

 Here are three possible rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects based on its structure/properties:
1. If a molecule contains an alkylating group such as an acrylamide or chloroacetaldehyde, it has a high likelihood of causing adverse effects. This is evident in the smiles strings C=CCOc1c(Br)cc(Br)cc1Br and C=CC(C)(CCC=C(C)C)OC=O, which both contain alkylating groups.
2. If a molecule has halogenated aromatic rings, it is more likely to have adverse effects. This is seen in the smiles strings N#Cc1c(F)cccc1F and COc1ccc(C=O)cc1OC, which both have halogenated aromatic rings.
3. If a molecule contains a nitrogen mustard or other alkylating group, it is likely to be carcinogenic and cause adverse effects. This is demonstrated by the smiles string CO/N=C(\C(=O)N[C@@H]1C(=O)N2C(C(=O)[O-])=C(C[n+]3ccc(N)n3CCO)CS[C@H]12)c1csc(N)n1, which contains a nitrogen mustard.

================================

 Here are three possible rules to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
1. If a molecule has a nitro group (-N=[N+]([O-])O) in its structure, it might be toxic to living organisms due to its potential to form reactive oxygen species (ROS).
2. If a molecule has an aromatic amine group (-Nc1ccccc1) in its structure, it could be a carcinogenic agent, as this group can generate aromatic amino compounds, which are known to be mutagenic and cancer-causing agents.
3. If a molecule is a heavy metal ion complex, it could be toxic to living organisms, as heavy metals are known to have a range of adverse health effects, including neurotoxicity, developmental toxicity, and carcinogenicity.

================================

 1. Molecules with multiple chlorine substituents or organic pollutants (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins) are likely to have adverse effects.
2. Molecules with formal charges or reactive functional groups (e.g., epoxides, carbenium ions, carbanions) are more likely to have adverse effects.
3. Molecules with aromatic amines or heterocyclic rings (e.g., pyridines, thiazoles) are more likely to have adverse effects.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be used to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
1. The presence of certain functional groups or motifs, such as acetamides, aromatic amines, or haloacetic acids, which are known to be toxic or carcinogenic.
2. The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of the molecule, which can affect its ability to penetrate biological membranes and interact with cellular targets. Molecules with higher logP values (logarithm of the partition coefficient between octanol and water) tend to be more hydrophobic and thus more likely to have adverse effects.
3. The presence of reactive groups or species, such as aldehydes, ketones, or free radicals, which can react with and damage cellular macromolecules such as DNA, proteins, and lipids. These groups can also undergo oxidation or reduction reactions that generate toxic species.

================================

 Based on the smiles strings labeled as 1 and 0, we can infer the following 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is capable of causing adverse effects:
1. A molecule with an aromatic amine group linked to a halogenated benzene ring is likely to have adverse effects (labeled as 1). For example, Nc1ccn([C@@H]2O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)C2(F)F)c(=O)n1.
2. Molecules with nitrogen mustards or acrylamide moieties are likely to have adverse effects (labeled as 1). For example, CCOC(=O)C(C#N)=C(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1 and O=NN(CCO)CCO.
3. A molecule with a positively charged quaternary ammonium ion is likely to have adverse effects (labeled as 1). For example, CCC[N+](CCC)(CCC)CCCC.
