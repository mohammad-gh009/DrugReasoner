 Rule 1: Molecules with a more negative epsilon LUMO value tend to have a stronger tendency to accept electrons and are more likely to act as electrophiles in chemical reactions.
Rule 2: Molecules with a more positive epsilon LUMO value tend to have a stronger tendency to donate electrons and are more likely to act as nucleophiles in chemical reactions.
Rule 3: The presence of multiple conjugated pi bonds in a molecule generally leads to a lower epsilon LUMO value, as the pi electrons can be delocalized and shared between multiple atoms, making it easier for the molecule to accept electrons.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a more negative epsilon LUMO value tend to have a higher tendency to accept electrons and form anions. Therefore, molecules with a more negative epsilon LUMO value are more likely to be anionic.
Rule 2: Molecules with a more positive epsilon LUMO value tend to have a higher tendency to donate electrons and form cations. Therefore, molecules with a more positive epsilon LUMO value are more likely to be cationic.
Rule 3: Molecules with a high degree of unsaturation (多个双键和三键) tend to have a lower epsilon LUMO value. This is because the presence of multiple bonds increases the energy level of the molecular orbitals, leading to a lower epsilon LUMO value.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a more negative epsilon LUMO value tend to be more easy to donate electrons. Therefore, molecules with negative epsilon LUMO values are likely to act as nucleophiles in chemical reactions.
 Rule 2: Molecules with a positive epsilon LUMO value tend to be more easy to accept electrons. Therefore, molecules with positive epsilon LUMO values are likely to act as electrophiles in chemical reactions.
 Rule 3: The presence of multiple bonds (e.g. C=O, C=C) between a nitrogen atom and a carbon atom in a molecule leads to an increase in the epsilon LUMO value of the molecule. This is because the multiple bonds make it easier for the nitrogen atom to accept electrons and thus increase the epsilon LUMO value.

================================

 1. Molecules with a negative Epsilon LUMO value tend to be electrophiles, while molecules with a positive Epsilon LUMO value tend to be nucleophiles.
2. Molecules with aromaticity or conjugated systems tend to have lower Epsilon LUMO values, making them more electron-rich and better nucleophiles.
3. The presence of multiple bonds, such as in unsaturated fatty acids or carbonyls, can increase the Epsilon LUMO value and make a molecule more reactive as an electrophile.

================================

 Here are three possible rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
1. The epsilon LUMO value is lower for molecules with conjugated pi bonds, aromatic systems, or multiple bonds, as these systems tend to have lower-energy molecular orbitals.
2. The epsilon LUMO value is higher for molecules with ethers, amines, or alcohols, as these groups tend to have higher-energy molecular orbitals due to their lone pairs.
3. The epsilon LUMO value is higher for molecules with positively charged species, such as protonated amino groups or carbocations, as these species have a lower energy level for the LUMO due to the presence of an extra electron in the molecule.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
1. The epsilon LUMO value is lower for molecules with multiple nitrile groups. This is because the nitrile group has a high electronegativity and can draw electrons away from the molecule, creating a partial negative charge that can lower the LUMO energy level.
2. The epsilon LUMO value is higher for molecules with aromatic rings. This is because the delocalized electrons in the aromatic ring can move around more freely, making it harder to remove electrons from the molecule and raising the LUMO energy level.
3. The epsilon LUMO value is lower for molecules with multiple conjugated double bonds. This is because the delocalized electrons in the double bonds can move around more freely, making it easier to donate electrons and lowering the LUMO energy level.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
1. Molecules with a carbonyl group (C=O) tend to have a lower epsilon LUMO value. For example, N#CC(=O)[C@@]1(O)C[C@@H]1O has a negative epsilon LUMO value of -2.291199. This means that the molecule is more stable and less reactive.
2. Molecules with double or triple bonds tend to have a higher epsilon LUMO value. For example, C#C[C@H]1C=CC[C@H]2N[C@@H]12 has an epsilon LUMO value of 0.628583, which is relatively high. This indicates that the molecule is more reactive and can participate in chemical reactions easily.
3. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have a lower epsilon LUMO value. For example, N#CC[C@]12C[C@H]1C(=O)O2 has an epsilon LUMO value of -0.397286. This means that the molecule is less reactive and more stable. Aromatic rings have a stabilizing effect on molecules, which contributes to a lower epsilon LUMO value.

================================

 1. Molecules with an epsilon LUMO value greater than 0 tend to be electrophiles, meaning they have an ability to accept electrons. Therefore, molecules with an epsilon LUMO value greater than 0 are more likely to react with nucleophiles (molecules with a low-lying HOMO energy level).
2. Molecules with an epsilon LUMO value close to 0 tend to be nonreactive. This is because they have a small electron density in the LUMO orbital, making it difficult for them to accept electrons from other molecules.
3. The epsilon LUMO value is also affected by the presence of multiple bonds, aromatic rings, and conjugated systems. Molecules with multiple bonds, aromatic rings, or conjugated systems tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values, making them less reactive.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
1. Molecules with conjugated systems or multiple bonds tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values, as the pi-electron density is delocalized and stable, making it more difficult to remove an electron.
2. Molecules with electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyls, nitriles, and acetylides tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values, as the electron density is draw away from the molecule, making it easier to remove an electron.
3. Molecules with high steric hindrance or bulky groups tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values, as the repulsion between the electrons causes the molecule to be less stable and more likely to undergo reactions that involve the transfer of electrons, such as reduction or oxidation.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the epsilon LUMO value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with multiple ring systems and/or aromatic groups tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values. For example, many of the molecules with low epsilon LUMO values (e.g., [NH-][C@H]1OC=NC=NC1=O and CO[CH+][NH2+][C@@H]1[C@@H]2C[C@H]1N2) contain multiple rings and/or aromatic groups.
2. Molecules with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values. For example, molecules such as N#C[C@@H]1OCC=C1C=O and C#C[C@H]1[C@H]2O[C@H]2[C@@]12CN2 have high epsilon LUMO values due to the presence of EWGs like carbonyl and cyanide groups.
3. Molecules with multiple heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur) tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values. This is because these heteroatoms have lone pairs of electrons that can contribute to the molecule's electron density and lower its energy, resulting in a lower epsilon LUMO value. Examples of such molecules include O=C1[C@H]2C[C@H]2[C@H]2OC[C@@H]12 and CC[C@H]1NC(=O)[C@H]1CO.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
1. The epsilon LUMO value is negatively correlated with the number of ring systems in a molecule. Molecules with more ring systems tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values, indicating that they are more stable and less reactive. For example, CCO[C@H]1C[N@H+]2CC[C@@H]12 and C[C@@]12CO[C@@H](C1)[C@H]1O[C@H]12 both have higher epsilon LUMO values than C1O[C@H]1[C@H]1OCC12CC2, which has one less ring system.
2. The epsilon LUMO value is positively correlated with the presence of multiple heteroatoms in a molecule, especially nitrogen and oxygen. Molecules with more heteroatoms tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values, indicating that they are less stable and more reactive. For example, C[C@@]12CO[C@@H](C1)[C@H]1O[C@H]12 has a higher epsilon LUMO value than CCO[C@H]1C[N@H+]2CC[C@@H]12, which does not contain any oxygen atoms.
3. The epsilon LUMO value is positively correlated with the presence of multiple conjugated double bonds or triple bonds in a molecule. Molecules with more conjugated double bonds or triple bonds tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values, indicating that they are less stable and more reactive. For example, CC[C@@H]1CN=COC1=O has a higher epsilon LUMO value than CCO[C@H]1C[N@H+]2CC[C@@H]12, which does not contain any conjugated double bonds.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
1. The epsilon LUMO value is lower for molecules with multiple bonds, aromatic rings, and conjugated systems, as these features tend to stabilize the LUMO energy level. For example, molecules with double or triple bonds between non-hydrogen atoms (e.g., C=C or C≡C) generally have lower epsilon LUMO values than their saturated counterparts. Similarly, molecules with aromatic rings or conjugated systems often have lower epsilon LUMO values than molecules without these features.
2. The epsilon LUMO value is higher for molecules with electron-withdrawing groups, as these groups tend to destabilize the LUMO energy level. For example, molecules with groups such as carbonyls, nitriles, or halogens tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values than molecules without these groups. This is because the electron-withdrawing groups remove electrons from the molecule, making it more difficult for electrons to be transferred to the LUMO level.
3. The epsilon LUMO value is higher for molecules with positive charges or protons, as these species have an increased energy barrier for electron transfer to the LUMO level. This is because the positive charge or proton creates a repulsion between the electrons in the LUMO level and the positively charged species. Molecules with positively charged species (e.g., [NH3+]) or protons (e.g., H3O+) tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values than their uncharged counterparts.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher number of double bonds or aromatic rings tend to have a lower epsilon LUMO value, as these systems are more stable and require less energy to add an electron.
Rule 2: Molecules with electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyls, nitriles, and carboxylates tend to have a higher epsilon LUMO value, as these groups draw electrons away from the molecule and make it easier to accept an additional electron.
Rule 3: Molecules with amino groups or other electron-donating moieties tend to have a lower epsilon LUMO value, as these groups donate electrons to the molecule and make it easier to accept an additional electron.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher epsilon LUMO value tend to have more electron-rich moieties, such as double or triple bonds, aromatic rings, or heteroatoms with lone pairs.
Rule 2: Molecules with a lower epsilon LUMO value tend to have more electron-deficient moieties, such as rings with unsaturated bonds or aromatic rings without lone pairs.
Rule 3: Molecules with a higher epsilon LUMO value are more likely to accept electrons in chemical reactions, while molecules with a lower epsilon LUMO value are more likely to donate electrons.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the epsilon LUMO value of a molecule based on its structure and properties:
1. Molecules with a high degree of unsaturation (e.g. multiple double bonds or aromatic systems) tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values, as the energy required to add an electron to such molecules is lower due to the availability of low-lying empty molecular orbitals. For example, molecules such as C#CC#CC and C#CC1CCC(=O)CC1 have low epsilon LUMO values.
2. Molecules with positively charged nitrogen atoms often have higher epsilon LUMO values, as the presence of a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom can stabilize the molecular orbitals and increase the energy required to add an electron. For example, molecules such as C[CH+]1C=C([NH-])C(F)=CO1 and C[N@@H+]1[C@H]2C=C[C@@H]1C2(C)C have higher epsilon LUMO values.
3. Molecules with delocalized pi-electron systems (e.g. aromatic rings or heterocycles) tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values, as the pi-electrons can be distributed across multiple atoms and stabilize the molecular orbitals. For example, molecules such as C#C[C@]12C[C@@H]1N2 and c1c[nH]cn1 have higher epsilon LUMO values.

================================

 1. Molecules with an epsilon LUMO value greater than 0.8 are likely to have some degree of aromaticity. This is because the epsilon LUMO value represents the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, which in aromatic compounds is delocalized over the entire molecule, leading to a stabilizing effect.
2. Molecules with an epsilon LUMO value less than -0.8 are likely to be reactive towards electrophiles. This is because the epsilon LUMO value represents the energy level of the molecule's LUMO, which is the molecular orbital that is able to accept an electron pair from an electrophile. Molecules with a low epsilon LUMO value are more likely to have a high energy LUMO, making them more reactive towards electrophiles.
3. Molecules with an epsilon LUMO value greater than 0.8 and an epsilon HOMO value less than -6.0 are likely to be good electron acceptors. This is because a molecule with a high epsilon LUMO value indicates that it is able to accept electrons, while a low epsilon HOMO value indicates that it is not easily able to donate electrons. Therefore, molecules with both high epsilon LUMO and low epsilon HOMO values are good electron acceptors.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the epsilon LUMO value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds between non-CCN(CC) atoms tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values compared to molecules with single bonds between these atoms. For example, C#CC[C@H]1NC12COC2 has a higher epsilon LUMO value than C#CC[C@@H]1[N@@H+]2CC[C@@]1(O)C2.
2. Molecules with more double bonds between C=C or C=O atoms tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values. For example, CCOC(C)(C)CC=O has a lower epsilon LUMO value than C#CCc1ocnc1N.
3. Molecules with more aromaticity tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values. For example, C[C@H]1C=CN(C)C(=O)O1 has a higher epsilon LUMO value than COC(C)(C)CC=O.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the structure/property of a molecule to its epsilon LUMO value:
1. Molecules with conjugated systems or multiple bonds tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values, as the delocalized pi-electrons can be easily excited to fill the LUMO orbital. For example, most of the molecules with C=C or C#C bonds have lower epsilon LUMO values compared to those without.
2. Molecules with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs), such as nitrogen-containing heterocycles, carbonyls, or halogens, tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values, as the EWGs pull electrons away from the molecule and decrease the energy required to excite an electron to fill the LUMO orbital.
3. Molecules with aromatic rings or amines tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values, as the delocalized pi-electrons in the aromatic ring or lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom can be easily excited to fill the LUMO orbital.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
1. The epsilon LUMO value is inversely proportional to the electronegativity of the atoms in the molecule. Molecules with a higher number of electronegative atoms will have a lower epsilon LUMO value, as the electrons are more attracted to the nucleus and are less likely to be esc

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
1. Molecules with conjugated double bonds, such as alkenes, have lower epsilon LUMO values compared to molecules without conjugated double bonds. This is because the delocalized pi-electron system in conjugated double bonds lowers the energy of the molecular orbitals, including the epsilon LUMO.
2. Amines and their derivatives tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values compared to molecules without nitrogen atoms. This is because the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom can donate electrons into the molecular orbitals, raising the energy of the molecular orbitals, including the epsilon LUMO.
3. Molecules with positive charges, such as cations, tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values compared to neutral molecules. This is because the positively charged species have fewer electrons in the molecular orbitals, which raises the energy of the molecular orbitals, including the epsilon LUMO.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with epsilon LUMO values greater than 0.5 generally have multiple bonds, such as double or triple bonds, and/or aromatic rings. This is because multiple bonds and aromaticity increase the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which decreases the energy gap between the HOMO and the LUMO, leading to a lower epsilon LUMO value.
Rule 2: Molecules with epsilon LUMO values less than -0.5 generally have polar bonds, such as C-F or O-H bonds, and/or aromatic rings. This is because polar bonds and aromaticity increase the energy of the HOMO, which decreases the energy gap between the HOMO and the LUMO, leading to a lower epsilon LUMO value.
Rule 3: Molecules with epsilon LUMO values between -0.5 and 0.5 generally have non-polar bonds and no aromatic rings. These molecules may have multiple bonds, but they are not as conjugated as in molecules with epsilon LUMO values greater than 0.5. In these molecules, the energy of the LUMO is determined primarily by the electronegativity of the atoms and the shape of the molecule.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the epsilon LUMO value of a molecule based on its structure and properties:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds (e.g., C=O, C#CC#CC=O) tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values compared to molecules with single bonds. This is because multiple bonds allow for greater delocalization of electrons, which lowers the energy required to add another electron to the system.
2. Aromatic systems (e.g., cinnamaldehyde, caffeine) tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values compared to molecules without aromatic rings. This is because aromatic systems have a stable electron cloud that requires more energy to disrupt, making it more difficult to add another electron to the system.
3. Molecules with positive charges (e.g., [NH3+], [NH2+]) tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values compared to neutral molecules. This is because positive charges create a destabilizing effect that raises the energy required to add another electron to the system.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
1. Molecules with multiple conjugated double bonds or aromatic systems tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values, indicating that they are better electron donors.
2. Molecules with high electronegativity atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, and halogens tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values, indicating that they are better electron acceptors.
3. Molecules with polar functional groups such as alcohols, carbonyls, and carboxylates tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values, indicating that they are better electron acceptors.

================================

 1. Molecules with lower epsilon LUMO values tend to be more electronegative and have an overall negative charge.
2. Molecules with higher epsilon LUMO values tend to be less electronegative and have an overall positive charge.
3. The presence of multiple heteroatoms, such as oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur, in a molecule generally increases its epsilon LUMO value.

================================

 1. Molecules with a more positive epsilon LUMO value tend to be better electron acceptors. Therefore, molecules with higher epsilon LUMO values are more likely to participate in electron acceptor processes.
2. Molecules with a more negative epsilon LUMO value tend to be better electron donors. Therefore, molecules with lower epsilon LUMO values are more likely to participate in electron donor processes.
3. Molecules with an epsilon LUMO value close to zero are poor electron acceptors and electron donors. These molecules are not likely to participate in electron acceptor or electron donor processes.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
1. Molecules with multiple conjugated unsaturated bonds tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values, indicating that they are more electronegative and thus more stable. For example, C#C[C@@H]1O[C@H](C)[C@@H]1C=O has an epsilon LUMO value of -0.917024, while N#CC#CC=O has an epsilon LUMO value of -3.295299.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings or multiple heteroatoms tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values, indicating that they are less stable and more prone to oxidation. For example, C#C[C@]12CC[C@@]1(OC)C2 has an epsilon LUMO value of 1.115667, while O=C1C[C@H]2CCO[C@@H]12 has an epsilon LUMO value of -0.908860.
3. Molecules with positive charges tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values, indicating that they are more stable and less prone to reduction. This is because positive charges attract electrons, making it more difficult to donate additional electrons to fill the LUMO orbital. For example, C[C@@H]1O[C@H](C)[C@@H]1C=O has an epsilon LUMO value of -0.917024, while C[C@H]1O[C@H]2[C@@H]1[C@]2(C)O has an epsilon LUMO value of 1.945614.

================================

 Based on the data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds between a nitrogen atom and a carbon atom tend to have a lower epsilon LUMO value. For example, C#CC[C@@H](C=O)OC=O has a epsilon LUMO value of -1.412271, while its isomer, C#CCC(C)(CC)CC, has a epsilon LUMO value of 1.428598. This can be attributed to the presence of multiple bonds between a nitrogen atom and a carbon atom in the former, which decreases the energy required to add an electron to the molecule and thus decreases the epsilon LUMO value.
2. Molecules with an sp3 hybridized nitrogen atom tend to have a higher epsilon LUMO value. For example, CO/C(N)=N/CC#N has a epsilon LUMO value of 0.663958, while its isomer, N#CCC1(O)CCCC1, has a epsilon LUMO value of -0.179595. This can be attributed to the fact that the sp3 hybridized nitrogen atom in the latter makes the molecule more resistant to the addition of an electron and thus increases the energy required, resulting in a higher epsilon LUMO value.
3. Molecules with an sp2 hybridized nitrogen atom in the form of a heterocycle tend to have a lower epsilon LUMO value. For example, c1cc2ncoc2[nH]1 has a epsilon LUMO value of 0.302046, while its isomer, C[C@@H]1C=C[C@H](CC#N)C1, has a epsilon LUMO value of 0.280277. This can be attributed to the presence of the nitrogen atom in the aromatic ring, which increases the electron density in the molecule and decreases the energy required to add an electron, resulting in a lower epsilon LUMO value.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a more negative epsilon LUMO value tend to be more stable and have a stronger tendency to accept electrons. Therefore, molecules with a more negative epsilon LUMO value are less reactive and more stable.
Rule 2: Molecules with a positive epsilon LUMO value tend to be less stable and have a stronger tendency to lose electrons. Therefore, molecules with a positive epsilon LUMO value are more reactive and less stable.
Rule 3: Molecules with a higher epsilon LUMO value tend to be better at accepting electrons and participating in redox reactions. Therefore, molecules with a higher epsilon LUMO value are more likely to act as electron acceptors in redox reactions.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the epsilon LUMO value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds between non-metals (e.g. C=O, C=N) tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values. This is because multiple bonds between non-metals allow for the formation of pi-bonds, which stabilize the molecule and lower its energy. For example, molecules such as N=CNc1cnoc1, CC#CC([NH2+]C)OCC, and C#CC1=C(C=O)COC1 all have multiple bonds between non-metals and have relatively low epsilon LUMO values.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values. This is because the delocalized pi-electron system in aromatic rings stabilizes the molecule and raises its energy. For example, molecules such as COc1c(C)noc1C, O=C[C@]12C[C@H](C1)O[CH+][NH2+]2, and C[C@@H]1C=C2CC[C@@H]2O1 all have aromatic rings and have relatively high epsilon LUMO values.
3. Molecules with positively charged nitrogen atoms tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values. This is because the positive charge on the nitrogen atom polarizes the molecule and makes it more stable. For example, molecules such as N#Cc1ncc([NH-])[nH+]n1, C[C@@H]1C=C2CC[C@@H]2O1[NH+], and [NH-][CH+]O[C@@H]1COC[C@@H]1O all have positively charged nitrogen atoms and have relatively low epsilon LUMO values.

================================

 Based on the given molecules and their corresponding epsilon LUMO values, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
1. The presence of multiple carbonyl groups or electron-withdrawing groups such as nitrile, cyano, or acetylene moieties tend to decrease the epsilon LUMO value. For example, CCO[C@@H]1C(=O)[C@@H]2O[C@H]12, CC(=O)C#C(C)=O, and CCC[C@]12CO[C@H]1[C@H]2O have low epsilon LUMO values due to the presence of multiple carbonyl groups.
2. The presence of multiple hydroxy groups or amino groups tend to increase the epsilon LUMO value. For example, C[C@@H](O)C(=O)C#CCO and Cn1nncc1NC=O have high epsilon LUMO values due to the presence of multiple hydroxy groups.
3. The presence of aromatic rings or heteroaromatic rings tend to increase the epsilon LUMO value. For example, N#CC#C[C@@]1(C#N)CN1, CCO[C@@H]1C(=O)[C@@H]2O[C@H]12, and O=c1cccncn1 have high epsilon LUMO values due to the presence of aromatic rings.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a high epsilon LUMO value tend to have multiple fused rings or aromatic systems, which can stabilize the LUMO energy level through conjugation.
Example: C1=C[C@@]23CC[C@@]2(C3)OC1 has a high epsilon LUMO value due to the presence of a fused bicyclic system.
Rule 2: Molecules with an sp hybridized atom in the LUMO or近似LUMO level tend to have a high epsilon LUMO value.
Example: C#CC1([C@H]2CCO2)CC1 has a high epsilon LUMO value due to the presence of a carbon atom with an sp hybridization in the LUMO level.
Rule 3: Molecules with an sp2 or sp3 hybridized atom with a lone pair electrons in the epsilon LUMO level tend to have a high epsilon LUMO value.
Example: O=C1C[C@@H]2C[C@@H]3[C@H](C1)[N@H+]23 -0.473478 has a high epsilon LUMO value due to the presence of a nitrogen atom with a lone pair electron in the epsilon LUMO level.

================================

 1. Molecules with a more positive epsilon LUMO value tend to be better electron acceptors. Therefore, molecules with a high epsilon LUMO value are likely to have acceptor groups such as carbonyl, nitrile, or acid chloride groups.
2. Molecules with a more negative epsilon LUMO value tend to be better electron donors. Therefore, molecules with a low epsilon LUMO value are likely to have donor groups such as amino, hydroxy, or methoxy groups.
3. The epsilon LUMO value is also affected by the overall structure of the molecule. For example, molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have a lower epsilon LUMO value, while molecules with single bonds between non-aromatic atoms tend to have a higher epsilon LUMO value.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred based on the given data:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values than molecules without aromatic rings. This can be seen in the data set, where many aromatic molecules such as CCOc1nocc1C, Cc1nc(C#N)c(C)o1, and O=C1CCC=C[C@@H](O)C1 have low epsilon LUMO values.
2. Molecules with multiple bonds between non-metals tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values than molecules with fewer or no multiple bonds between non-metals. For example, C#CC1=CC(=O)C(=O)C1 has a much higher epsilon LUMO value than C[C@]12CC=C[C@H](C1)C2=O.
3. Molecules with anionic species tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values than molecules without anionic species. This can be seen in the data set, where many molecules with anionic species such as C[NH2+][C@H]1CO[C@H]([NH-])CO1, O=C1C[N@H+]2[C@@H]([C@H]3CO3)[C@@H]12, and N#CC[C@]12N[C@H]1[C@@H]1N[C@@H]12 have low epsilon LUMO values.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the epsilon LUMO value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with heteroatoms (e.g., O, N, F) tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values compared to molecules without heteroatoms. For example, molecules such as Nc1cc2ocnc2o1 and C[C@]12[C@@H]3[C@@H]4[C@H]1C[N@@H4][C@@H]32 have high epsilon LUMO values, while molecules such as C#C[C@H]1C=CC[C@H]2C[N@H+]21 and CC[C@@H](O)CC1CCC1 have lower epsilon LUMO values.
2. Molecules with multiple bonds (e.g., C=O, C=C) tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values compared to molecules with single bonds. For example, molecules such as Cc1nocc1CCO and CC[C@@H](C=O)OC(N)=O have high epsilon LUMO values, while molecules such as O[C@H]1C[C@@H]2C1=C[C@@H]1C[C@@H]12 and C#C[C@H]1[N@@H]2C[C@@]1(O)[C@H]2C have lower epsilon LUMO values.
3. Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., benzene, pyridine) tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values compared to molecules without aromatic rings. For example, molecules such as Nc1cc2ocnc2o1 and [NH-][C@@H]1C[C@H]([NH-])NC(=O)N1 have high epsilon LUMO values, while molecules such as CCO[C@H]1C[C@H]1C(N)=O and C#C[C@H]1[N@@H]2C[C@@]1(O)[C@H]2C have lower epsilon LUMO values.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the structure/property of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
1. Molecules with a cyano group (C#N) generally have a low epsilon LUMO value. For example, Cc1cc(C#N)oc1N has an epsilon LUMO value of -0.674842.
2. Molecules with an amino group (NH2) or a positively charged nitrogen atom (N) generally have a high epsilon LUMO value. For example, C[C@@H](O)[C@@]1(C)C[NH2+][CH+]O1 has an epsilon LUMO value of 0.623141.
3. Molecules with an sp-hybridized carbon atom next to a carbonyl group (C=O) generally have a high epsilon LUMO value. For example, C[C@@H](C=O)C(=O)N1CC1 has an epsilon LUMO value of -1.061244.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a negative epsilon LUMO value tend to be nucleophilic, while molecules with a positive epsilon LUMO value tend to be electrophilic.
 Rule 2: Molecules with a high epsilon LUMO value tend to have good electron-accepting ability, while molecules with a low epsilon LUMO value tend to have poor electron-accepting ability.
 Rule 3: Molecules with a high epsilon LUMO value and a negative epsilon LUMO value difference tend to have good stability and reactivity, as they can easily accept electrons from electron donors and donate electrons to electron acceptors.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
1. Molecules with conjugated systems, such as double or triple bonds, aromatic rings, or heteroatoms with lone pairs, tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values due to the presence of delocalized pi electrons. For example, C=C double bonds and aromatic rings like in [NH-]c1nc(O)c(N)[cH+]o1 and CCc1nc[nH]n1 have lower epsilon LUMO values compared to molecules without these features.
2. Molecules with high electronegativity atoms, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and fluorine, tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values due to the withdrawal of electron density from the molecule. For example, molecules like N#CC(=N)N1CCCC1 and Cn1cnc(F)nc1=O have higher epsilon LUMO values due to the presence of multiple nitrogen atoms.
3. Molecules with positive or negative charges tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values due to the breakage of covalent bonds and the formation of ionic species. For example, the cationic molecule [NH-]c1nc(O)c(N)[cH+]o1 has a higher epsilon LUMO value compared to the neutral molecule O=C1NC[C@@]23CC[C@@]12N3.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a more negative epsilon LUMO value tend to be more easily oxidized, while molecules with a more positive epsilon LUMO value tend to be more easily reduced.
Rule 2: Molecules with multiple conjugated bonds or aromatic systems tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values, as the delocalized pi-electron system can stabilize the molecule and make it easier to donate electrons.
Rule 3: Molecules with high electronegativity atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, and halogens tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values, as the electronegativity of these atoms withdraws electrons from the molecule and makes it easier to accept electrons.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds between a nitrogen atom and a carbon atom tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values. For example, N-vinylpyrrolidone has a very low epsilon LUMO value of -1.512953 because of the double bond between the nitrogen and the carbon in the pyrrolidone ring.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values. For example, the epsilon LUMO value of benzene is 0.810899, which is relatively high compared to other molecules on the list. This is because the aromatic pi system in benzene delocalizes electrons and makes it more stable.
3. Molecules with multiple bonds between two carbon atoms tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values. For example, acetylene has a high epsilon LUMO value of 1.453088 because of the triple bond between the two carbon atoms.

================================

 Based on the given data of molecules and their corresponding epsilon LUMO values, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
1. Increased conjugation in a molecule leads to a lower epsilon LUMO value. For example, C=C double bonds and aromatic rings increase conjugation, which can lead to a lower epsilon LUMO value. This can be seen in molecules like C#C[C@H](C)N(C=O)CC and C[C@H]1C[C@@]12C[C@H]1C[C@]12O.
2. The presence of multiple heteroatoms in a molecule increases the epsilon LUMO value. Heteroatoms have a higher electronegativity than carbon, which can draw electron density away from the molecule, making it more difficult to remove an electron to form a negative ion. This can be seen in molecules like N#C[C@]1(N)C[C@@]12CCO2 and O=c1[nH]nn[nH]c1=O.
3. The presence of an sp2 hybridized carbon with a negative formal charge in a molecule increases the epsilon LUMO value. Sp2 hybridized carbons have one sigma bond and two p orbitals, which can participate in conjugation and delocalize electrons. The negative formal charge on the carbon can also draw electron density away from the molecule, making it more difficult to remove an electron to form a negative ion. This can be seen in molecules like Cc1cc(F)c(N)cn1 and C[C@@H]1C[C@@H]2C[C@H]1OC[C@H]2C.
These rules provide a starting point for predicting epsilon LUMO values based on the structure and composition of a molecule. However, it's important to note that other factors like solvation, temperature, and the presence of other ions can also affect the epsilon LUMO value.

================================

 After analyzing the given molecules and their corresponding epsilon LUMO values, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
1. Increased unsaturation in a molecule generally increases the epsilon LUMO value. For example, molecules with multiple bonds (C=O, C=C, etc.) tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values compared to molecules with single bonds. This is because multiple bonds have a higher density of electrons, which leads to a lower energy level and a higher epsilon LUMO value.
2. The presence of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as carbonyls, nitriles, and amides can increase the epsilon LUMO value of a molecule. EWGs withdraw electrons from a molecule, which makes it more difficult for the molecule to donate electrons. As a result, the epsilon LUMO value increases, making the molecule a better acceptor of electrons.
3. The presence of conjugated systems can increase the epsilon LUMO value of a molecule. Conjugated systems have delocalized pi-electrons, which makes it easier for the molecule to donate electrons and accept electrons. This increases the energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and decreases the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), leading to a higher epsilon LUMO value.

================================

 1. Molecules with a more negative LUMO energy tend to be better electron donors.
2. Molecules with a less negative LUMO energy tend to be better electron acceptors.
3. Molecules with a LUMO energy close to 0 are poor electron donors and acceptors.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the epsilon LUMO value of a molecule based on its structure and properties:
1. Molecules with conjugated systems (e.g., C=C bonds, aromatic rings) tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values, indicating greater stability and resistance to oxidation. For example, molecules like Nc1nc(O)ccc1F and O=C1[C@@H]2N[C@H]3[C@@H]2[C@@]13O have low epsilon LUMO values due to their aromatic nature.
2. Molecules with multiple nitrogen atoms often have higher epsilon LUMO values, indicating higher reactivity and lower stability. For example, [NH-]c1cn[nH+]c(N)c1 has a high epsilon LUMO value due to the presence of two nitrogen atoms.
3. Molecules with positively charged species (e.g., ammonium ions, protonated amines) tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values, indicating increased stability and reduced reactivity. For example, C[N@@H+]1CC[C@@]12CCC2=O has a lower epsilon LUMO value than its neutral form due to the presence of a protonated amine group.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a more negative epsilon LUMO value tend to be less reactive and more stable.
Rule 2: Molecules with a positive epsilon LUMO value tend to be better acceptors of electron density and more reactive.
Rule 3: Molecules with a higher epsilon LUMO value tend to have a stronger ability to accept electrons and participate in redox reactions.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the epsilon LUMO value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds between a nitrogen atom and another atom (e.g., C#CC[C@@H]1[C@H](O)[C@@H]1O) tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values. This is because the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom is shared between the two atoms, creating a more stable molecule.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., Cc1nocc1N) tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values. This is because the delocalized pi electrons in the aromatic ring can easily be excited to higher energy levels, resulting in a higher epsilon LUMO value.
3. Molecules with ammonium ions (e.g., C[N@@H+]1[C@@H]2[C@H]3[C@@H]4OC[C@@]31[C@@H]42) tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values. This is because the positively charged nitrogen atom attracts electrons, making it more difficult to remove an electron from the molecule and thus resulting in a higher epsilon LUMO value.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds between a nitrogen atom and a carbon atom tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values than molecules without such bonds. For example, N#CC(=O)[C@H]1CC(=O)O1 has a much lower epsilon LUMO value (-3.083050) than C[C@@H]1[C@H]2C[C@@H]1C2 (1.025869).
2. Molecules with aromatic systems tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values than molecules without aromatic systems. For example, C[C@@H]1[C@H]2C[C@@H]1C2 (1.025869) has a lower epsilon LUMO value than N#CC(=O)[C@H]1CC(=O)O1 (3.083050), despite both molecules containing similar functional groups.
3. Molecules with multiple bonds between a carbon atom and an oxygen atom tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values than molecules without such bonds. For example, CO[C@@H](C)C[C@H]1CCO1 (1.970104) has a higher epsilon LUMO value than Cc1ocnc1[C@H]1CO1 (0.035375), despite both molecules containing similar functional groups.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
1. Molecules with conjugated systems or aromatic rings tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values due to the delocalization of electrons, which makes it more stable. For example, molecules like Cc1ccc(N)c(C)c1, C#C[C@@](C)(C#CC)C=O, and C1=N[C@@H]2CCC[C@@H](C2)O1 have lower epsilon LUMO values because they have aromatic rings or delocalized pi-electron systems.
2. Molecules with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values due to the increase in electron density on the molecule, which makes it less stable. For example, molecules like O=CCC(=O)CNC=O and C#Cc1cc(N)[nH]c1O have higher epsilon LUMO values because they have EWGs such as carbonyl and nitroso groups.
3. Molecules with positively charged nitrogen atoms (NH+), such as in ammonium ions, tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values because the positive charge increases the electron density on the molecule, which makes it less stable. For example, molecules like [NH-][CH+]Oc1ncno1 and C#C[C@H](OCC)C(C)C have lower epsilon LUMO values because they have positively charged nitrogen atoms.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the epsilon LUMO value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds between a carbon and a nitrogen atom (e.g., C#N, CO) generally have lower epsilon LUMO values compared to molecules without such bonds. This is because the multiple bond reduces the energy needed to add an electron to the molecule.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., c1cnc2[nH]ccc2c1) or conjugated systems (e.g., C=CC=C) tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values compared to molecules without such systems. This is because the delocalized electrons in these systems can easily accept energy from an incoming electron.
3. Molecules with positively charged nitrogen atoms (e.g., [NH-][CH+], N#C[C@H](N)CO) generally have higher epsilon LUMO values compared to molecules without such atoms. This is because the positive charge on the nitrogen atom attracts electrons and increases the energy required to add an electron to the molecule.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
1. The epsilon LUMO value is generally lower for molecules with multiple bonds, such as double or triple bonds, than for molecules with single bonds. This is because multiple bonds tend to have a higher electron density, which lowers the energy required to remove an electron from the molecule. For example, molecules like C#CCC#C and C#CCC[N@@H]1O[C@@H]2C=C[C@@H]21 have multiple bonds and therefore have lower epsilon LUMO values.
2. The epsilon LUMO value is generally higher for aromatic compounds than for non-aromatic compounds. This is because aromatic compounds have a delocalized pi system, which increases the energy required to remove an electron from the molecule. For example, molecules like Cc1c(O)nnoc1=O and O=COCC1(CO)CC1 have aromatic rings and therefore have higher epsilon LUMO values.
3. The epsilon LUMO value is generally higher for positively charged molecules than for neutral molecules. This is because positively charged molecules have a lower electron density, which raises the energy required to remove an electron from the molecule. For example, molecules like N#CC1([NH+]2CC2)CC1 and [NH-]C1OC[C@H]2[N@H+]3C[C@@]12C3 have positive charges and therefore have higher epsilon LUMO values.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher number of double bonds and aromatic rings tend to have a lower epsilon LUMO value. This is because these structures have a higher degree of stability due to the delocalization of electrons, which lowers the energy required to remove an electron from the LUMO.
Example: C[C@H]1[C@@H](C#N)[C@H]2C[N@@H+]1C2 (0.843553) has one double bond and one aromatic ring, resulting in a lower epsilon LUMO value compared to molecules with more complex structures.
Rule 2: Molecules with an sp3 hybridized nitrogen atom in the LUMO or in the nearby orbitals tend to have a higher epsilon LUMO value. This is because the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom is not delocalized, making it easier to remove an electron from the LUMO.
Example: CCOCCC#CC#N (-1.080292) has an sp3 hybridized nitrogen atom in the LUMO, resulting in a higher epsilon LUMO value compared to molecules without an sp3 hybridized nitrogen atom in the LUMO or nearby orbitals.
Rule 3: Molecules with a higher number of halogens tend to have a higher epsilon LUMO value. This is because the halogen atoms have a high electron affinity, which raises the energy level of the molecular orbitals, making it easier to remove an electron from the LUMO.
Example: C[C@H]1O[C@H]2CCO[C@]21C (0.059865) has one chlorine atom, resulting in a higher epsilon LUMO value compared to molecules without halogen atoms.
