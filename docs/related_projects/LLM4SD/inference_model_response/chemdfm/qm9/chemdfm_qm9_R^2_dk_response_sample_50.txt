 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher number of OCC1([C@@H]2CO2) subunits tend to have a higher R^2 value.
Rule 2: Molecules with a higher number of C#C/C(=N/O)C1CCC1 subunits tend to have a higher R^2 value.
Rule 3: Molecules with a higher number of C[C@@H]1OC[C@H]2O[C@@H]12 subunits tend to have a lower R^2 value.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with multiple rings or extensive conjugation tend to have higher epsilon R^2 values. This is because such molecules often have delocalized pi-electrons, which can absorb light at higher wavelengths, leading to increased R^2 values.
Example: N#Cc1ncnc(N)n1 has a high epsilon R^2 value due to its aromatic pyrazine ring.
Rule 2: Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g., C=C, C=O) tend to have lower epsilon R^2 values. This is because such molecules do not have extensive conjugation and therefore do not absorb light at longer wavelengths, leading to lower R^2 values.
Example: C#C[C@]12C[C@H]([C@@H]1C)[N@H+]2C has a low epsilon R^2 value due to its unsaturated C=C bond.
Rule 3: Molecules with charged species (e.g., ammonium ion, carbonyl group) tend to have higher epsilon R^2 values. This is because such species can absorb light at higher wavelengths due to their polarizability, leading to increased R^2 values.
Example: N#CC1(CO)CC=CC1 has a high epsilon R^2 value due to the presence of an ammonium ion.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher number of heavy atoms (i.e., non-hydrogen atoms) tend to have a higher R^2 value.
Rule 2: Molecules with a higher number of functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, carbonyl) tend to have a higher R^2 value.
Rule 3: Molecules with a higher number of aromatic rings tend to have a higher R^2 value.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. Molecules with aromatic amines tend to have higher R^2 values. For example, Nc1cc(O)oc(=O)n1 has an R^2 value of 1082.861938, while Cc1cc(F)nc([NH-])[nH+]1 has an R^2 value of 1151.631592. This suggests that the presence of an aromatic amine group is associated with a higher predictability of the model.
2. Molecules with multiple ring systems tend to have lower R^2 values. For instance, C[C@@H]1OC[C@@]2(C=O)C[C@@H]12 has an R^2 value of 1208.064697, while C#C[C@@H]1[C@H](C)[N@@H+]1C(C)C has an R^2 value of 1275.805298. This implies that the complexity of a molecule, as indicated by the number of rings, may negatively affect the predictability of the model.
3. Molecules with unsaturated bonds or aromatic systems tend to have higher R^2 values. For example, CC#Cc1ncno1 has an R^2 value of 1695.946045, while C#C[C@@H]1OCC[C@@H]1CC has an R^2 value of 1451.283569. This suggests that the presence of unsaturated bonds or aromatic systems, which are common features in biologically active molecules, may improve the predictability of the model.

================================

 1. Molecules with a higher number of double bonds tend to have a higher epsilon R^2 value, as they have a more rigid and planar structure, which is associated with a higher polarity and therefore a higher epsilon R^2 value.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have a higher epsilon R^2 value, as the delocalized pi electrons in the aromatic ring create a more polarizable and thus more polar molecule.
3. Molecules with amine groups tend to have a higher epsilon R^2 value, as the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom can interact with water molecules and create a partial negative charge, leading to increased polarity and therefore a higher epsilon R^2 value.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher R^2 values.
Rule 2: Molecules with multiple ring systems or fused rings tend to have higher R^2 values.
Rule 3: Molecules with unsaturated bonds, such as double or triple bonds, tend to have higher R^2 values.

================================

 Based on the given molecules and their corresponding epsilon R^2 values, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. The presence of an amino group (-NH2) in a molecule is often associated with a high epsilon R^2 value. For example, molecules like N#C[C@H](CO)[C@@H](N)CO (1474.540649) and [NH-]c1cc(O)[nH+]c(F)c1 (1138.835327) have high epsilon R^2 values. This is because the amino group can undergo acid-base reactions, leading to changes in the molecule's net charge and dipole moment, which affect the polarizability and, consequently, the R^2 value.
2. The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a molecule is often associated with a moderate to high epsilon R^2 value. For example, molecules like C[C@@H]1CO[C@@H]1C=O (1054.886230) and O=C1NC[C@@H]2C[C@H]1O2 (752.780579) have moderate to high epsilon R^2 values. This is because the carbonyl group can undergo reactions with nucleophiles, leading to changes in the molecule's structure and, consequently, its polarizability and R^2 value.
3. The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule is often associated with a high epsilon R^2 value. For example, molecules like CCOCCC1CC1 (1808.359253) and c1ccn(COC[C@H]2COC(=O)[C@H]2C)c1 (1413.718628) have high epsilon R^2 values. This is because aromatic rings have delocalized pi-electrons, which make the molecule more polarizable and, consequently, increase its R^2 value.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred based on the given data:
1. Molecules with multiple unsaturated bonds (e.g., C#CCCCC(F)(F)F) tend to have higher R^2 values compared to molecules with fewer unsaturated bonds (e.g., CC(C)(O)C#CC1CC1). This suggests that the number of double or triple bonds in a molecule is positively correlated with its R^2 value.
2. Molecules with aromatic amines (e.g., C[C@@]12CO[C@]1(CO)CN2) or heteroaromatic amines (e.g., C[C@@H]1O[C@H]1C=O) tend to have higher R^2 values compared to molecules without these functional groups (e.g., C[C@H]1O[C@@H]1C=O). This indicates that the presence of aromatic or heteroaromatic amines is positively correlated with the R^2 value.
3. Molecules with basic functionality (e.g., amino, pyridinium) tend to have higher R^2 values compared to molecules without these functional groups (e.g., CC1=C[C@]23O[C@@]2(C1)[C@H]1C[C@H]13). This suggests that the presence of basic functional groups is positively correlated with the R^2 value.

================================

 After analyzing the given molecules and their corresponding epsilon R^2 value, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. The presence of aromatic rings and double bonds in a molecule can increase its R^2 value. This is because these functional groups can contribute to the overall polarity of the molecule, leading to increased interactions with the solvent and improved chromatographic behavior. For example, molecules like C#Cc1cc(O)[nH]c1N and C#CCCCCC(C)C have high R^2 values due to the presence of aromatic rings and double bonds.
2. The presence of ionic functional groups can increase a molecule's R^2 value. Ionic species are highly polar and can interact strongly with the stationary phase of the chromatograph, leading to improved chromatographic behavior. Examples of ionic functional groups include [NH-], [CH+], and [NH2+]. Molecules like C[NH2+]C(C)O[C@@H](C)C=O and CO[CH+][NH2+]CC1CCC1 have high R^2 values due to the presence of ionic functional groups.
3. The molecular weight of a molecule can influence its R^2 value. Generally, molecules with higher molecular weights tend to have lower R^2 values due to their greater size and lower overall polarity. However, this relationship is not always straightforward and can be influenced by other factors such as the distribution of polar functionality within the molecule. For example, molecules like CC[C@@H]1C=C2C=CC[C@@H]2C1 and CC[C@]12C=CC(=O)N1CC2 have high R^2 values despite their relatively low molecular weights due to the presence of multiple aromatic rings and double bonds.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the R^2 value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with multiple rings or complex structures tend to have higher R^2 values. For example, N#CCc1cc(N)co1 and C[C@@]12C[C@](O)(C1)[C@H]2C#N have higher R^2 values than molecules like Cc1ncc(F)nc1C or O=C1O[C@@H]2[C@H]3C[C@@H]2[C@@H]1C3, which have simpler structures.
2. Molecules with functional groups such as aminoes or carbonyls tend to have higher R^2 values. For example, O=C1O[C@@H]2[C@H]3C[C@@H]2[C@@H]1C3 has a lower R^2 value than molecules like N#CC[C@]12C[C@](O)(C1)[C@H]2C#N, which has an amino group.
3. Molecules with aromatic or heteroaromatic rings tend to have higher R^2 values. For example, Cc1ncc(F)nc1C has a lower R^2 value than molecules like N#CCc1cc(N)co1, which has a pyridine ring.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. The presence of double bonds in a molecule seems to increase its R^2 value. For example, C#C[C@@H]1[C@@H]2O[C@H](CO)[C@H]12 (R^2 = 1128.225952) and CC#CCc1nnon1 (R^2 = 1508.660400) both have double bonds in their structures, which could contribute to their higher R^2 values.
2. The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule seems to decrease its R^2 value. For example, C#C[C@@H]1[C@@H]2O[C@H](CO)[C@H]12 (R^2 = 1128.225952) has an aromatic ring in its structure, which could contribute to its lower R^2 value. On the other hand, Cc1[nH]nnc1O[CH+][NH-] (R^2 = 1269.334229) has no aromatic ring in its structure, which could contribute to its higher R^2 value.
3. The presence of certain functional groups, such as amino acids, seems to increase a molecule's R^2 value. For example, C[C@@]12COCC[C@H]1(C)C2 (R^2 = 1149.210693) contains an amino acid backbone, which could contribute to its higher R^2 value. Similarly, N#CC[C@@H]1OCC1=O (R^2 = 1043.641113) also contains an amino acid backbone, which could contribute to its higher R^2 value.

================================

 Based on the given molecules and their corresponding epsilon R^2 values, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a molecule is generally associated with a high epsilon R^2 value. For example, C#CCCCCC=O has an epsilon R^2 value of 1875.172729, while Cc1ccc(C=O)o1 has an epsilon R^2 value of 1301.301392. This suggests that the presence of a carbonyl group can increase the polarity of a molecule and therefore increase its ability to interact with other polar molecules, leading to a higher epsilon R^2 value.
2. The presence of multiple functional groups such as amino, hydroxy, and carboxy groups can also increase the epsilon R^2 value of a molecule. For example, C[C@@H]1O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)[C@H]1O has an epsilon R^2 value of 1020.002808, while Cc1cc(N)on1 has an epsilon R^2 value of 1084.632690. This is because these groups introduce additional polar sites into the molecule, increasing its polarity and allowing it to interact more strongly with other polar molecules.
3. The presence of aromatic rings can also increase the epsilon R^2 value of a molecule. For example, CCc1cc(N)on1 has an epsilon R^2 value of 1084.632690, while Cc1ccc(C=O)o1 has an epsilon R^2 value of 1301.301392. This is because aromatic rings are polar and can interact with other polar molecules through pi-pi interactions, leading to an increase in the epsilon R^2 value.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with an sp2 or sp3 hybridized carbon bonded to a double or triple bond tend to have higher R^2 values than molecules without such bonds.
Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic rings or unsaturated bonds (such as double or triple bonds) tend to have higher R^2 values than molecules without such features.
Rule 3: Molecules with amino groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles tend to have higher R^2 values than molecules without such functional groups.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the R^2 value of a molecule:
1. The presence of an aromatic ring (as indicated by a c1ccccc1 or c1ccccn1 group) is often associated with a higher R^2 value. For example, Cc1cnc(C)c(F)c1 has an R^2 value of 1226.633545, while C#C[C@H]1[C@H]2CC(=O)C[C@@H]12 has an R^2 value of 1018.322571.
2. The presence of certain functional groups, such as amino acids, alcohols, carboxylic acids, and ethers, seems to increase the R^2 value. For example, CC(=O)NCCO has an R^2 value of 1008.374207, while C[C@H]1OC[C@H]2[C@H]3C[C@@H]1[C@H]32 has an R^2 value of 1030.435669.
3. The molecular weight and complexity of a molecule also seem to influence its R^2 value. In general, molecules with higher molecular weights and more complex structures tend to have higher R^2 values. This can be seen in the examples provided, such as Cc1cnc(C)c(F)c1 with an R^2 value of 1226.633545, and COC[C@H]1CCOC1[NH-] with an R^2 value of 1349.295532.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. Molecules with multiple rings or complexity tend to have higher R^2 values. For example, C[C@@H]1O[C@H]2[C@H]3N[C@@H]3[C@@H]21 and C1C[C@@]23C[C@@H]2CO[C@@H]1O3 have high R^2 values because they have multiple rings and are more complex molecules.
2. Molecules with charged groups or aromatic rings tend to have higher R^2 values. For example, C[C@H]1O[C@@H]1C(C)=O and C#C[C@H]1CCC=CCO1 have high R^2 values because they contain charged groups and aromatic rings.
3. Molecules with unsaturated bonds or chiral centers tend to have lower R^2 values. For example, C#C[C@H]1O[C@@H]1[C@@H](C)O has a low R^2 value because it contains unsaturated bonds and a chiral center.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. The presence of an aldehyde group in a molecule is associated with a high R^2 value. Molecules such as CC1=C[C@@]2(O)CO[C@@H]1C2 (R^2 value of 1049.869141) and C#CC[C@H](O)C#CC#N (R^2 value of 1841.117310) have aldehyde groups and thus high R^2 values.
2. The presence of a nitrile group in a molecule is associated with a high R^2 value. Molecules such as C#C[C@H]1[C@@H](O)[C@H]2N[C@@H]12 (R^2 value of 832.502502) and C#CC1=C[C@H](NC=O)[C@@H](O)C1 (R^2 value of 1253.741089) have nitrile groups and thus high R^2 values.
3. The presence of an aromatic amine in a molecule is associated with a high R^2 value. Molecules such as CNc1cnc(CO)o1 (R^2 value of 1360.934570) and CN1C(CN)=NCC1[NH-] (R^2 value of 1280.607056) have aromatic amines and thus high R^2 values.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three possible rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. The presence of aromatic rings or double bonds in a molecule can increase its R^2 value. Many of the molecules in the given data with high R^2 values (e.g., N#C[C@@]1(N)CCC1, C[C@H]1CN=COC[C@H]1O) have aromatic rings or double bonds in their structures.
2. The presence of charged groups (e.g., [NH-], [CH+], [NH2+]) can increase a molecule's R^2 value. Many of the molecules with high R^2 values in the data (e.g., C[C@@H](O[CH+][NH-])[C@H]1CN1, N#CC1(N)CCC1, O=COC1COCOC1) have charged groups in their structures.
3. The type of functionality present in a molecule can also affect its R^2 value. For example, molecules with carbonyl groups (e.g., C[C@H]1CN=COC[C@H]1O, C#CC[C@@]1(C)C[C@@H]1CC) tend to have higher R^2 values than molecules without them. Similarly, molecules with amino groups (e.g., N#C[C@@]12[C@H]3[C@@H]4[C@@H]([N@@H+]41)[C@]32N) also tend to have higher R^2 values than molecules without them.

================================

 1. Aromaticity: Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher R^2 values. This is because the delocalized pi-electrons in aromatic rings create a more stable and organized structure, which can result in better interactions with the target protein.
2. Charged molecules: Charged molecules, especially positively charged molecules, tend to have higher R^2 values. This is because the positive charge can create electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged residues in the target protein, leading to stronger binding.
3. Hydrogen bonding capabilities: Molecules with hydrogen bond donor or acceptor groups tend to have higher R^2 values. This is because hydrogen bonds can form between the molecule and the target protein, leading to increased stability and affinity.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings or amino groups tend to have higher R^2 values. For example, Cc1onnc1N, N#CCc1cn[nH]c1N, and C[C@H]1OC[C@H]1C#N have high R^2 values because they contain aromatic rings or amino groups.
2. Molecules with polar functional groups, such as alcohols, carboxylic acids, and amines, tend to have lower R^2 values. For example, COc1c[nH]nc1CO and COC[C@H]1N[C@H]1C1CC1 have low R^2 values because they contain polar functional groups.
3. Molecules with complex ring systems or multiple bonds tend to have lower R^2 values. For example, Cn1cc(CO)cc1O and C#CC[C@@H]1[C@@H]2O[C@H]3[C@@H]2[C@@H]13 have low R^2 values because they have complex ring systems or multiple bonds.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the R^2 value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with a carbonyl group (C=O or C=C1C(=O)OCC1CO) tend to have higher R^2 values. For example, CCC1([C@@H](C)C=O)CC1 and CC1=C[C@]2(C)[C@@H]3[C@H]1O[C@@H]32 have R^2 values of 1313.557373 and 1068.445923, respectively.
2. Molecules with an aromatic ring (C#C[C@H](C)[C@@]1(C=O)CN1) or a heteroaromatic ring (O=c1ccnc(O)nc1) tend to have lower R^2 values. For example, C#C[C@]12C[N@@H+]3[C@H]1[C@@H]3CO2 and O=COc1ncon1 have R^2 values of 965.589294 and 942.749084, respectively.
3. Molecules with an amide bond (NC(=O)N1CCC1) or a positively charged nitrogen atom (N#C[C@]12CCC[C@H](C1)O2) tend to have moderate R^2 values. For example, NC(=O)N1CCC1 has an R^2 value of 762.122986, while N#C[C@]12CCC[C@H](C1)O2 has an R^2 value of 1063.386353.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the R^2 value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with aromatic amines tend to have high R^2 values. For example, compounds like [NH-]C1=CN=C([NH-])NN=C1 and Nc1cccoc1=O have high epsilon R^2 values. This is because aromatic amines tend to have strong dipole moments, which can interact favorably with the solvent, leading to high R^2 values.
2. Molecules with multiple rings or complex structures tend to have lower R^2 values. For example, compounds like CC1(C)CCCC1NO and O=C1C[C@H](O)C2(CC2)C1 have relatively low epsilon R^2 values. This is because such molecules have more complex structures, which can make it difficult for them to interact favorably with the solvent, leading to lower R^2 values.
3. Molecules with hydroxyl groups or amino groups tend to have high R^2 values. For example, compounds like C[C@@H]1O[C@H]2CC(=O)[C@@H]1O2 and OCCNc1cnno1 have high epsilon R^2 values. This is because hydroxyl and amino groups can form hydrogen bonds with the solvent, which can lead to higher solvation and higher R^2 values.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. Molecules with an sp2 hybridized carbon between a triple bond and a carbonyl group tend to have higher R^2 values. For example, C#CC[C@@]12O[C@@H]1C[C@@H]2C has an R^2 value of 2122.138916, while C#CCn1cc[nH]c1=O has an R^2 value of 1178.405762. This can be explained by the fact that the delocalized pi-electron system in such molecules leads to increased stability and thus higher R^2 values.
2. Molecules with an sp3 hybridized nitrogen next to a carbonyl group tend to have lower R^2 values. For example, C[C@@H](CO)[NH+]1CC1 has an R^2 value of 831.189819, while [NH-][CH+]Oc1cnon1 has an R^2 value of 988.511475. This can be attributed to the fact that the lone pair of the sp3 hybridized nitrogen in such molecules leads to increased instability and thus lower R^2 values.
3. Molecules with an sp3 hybridized carbon between two oxygen atoms tend to have lower R^2 values. For example, O[C@H]1C[C@@]2(CO2)O1 has an R^2 value of 903.439575, while C#C[C@@]12O[C@@H]1C[C@@H]2C has an R^2 value of 2122.138916. This can be explained by the fact that the repulsion between the lone pairs of the two oxygen atoms in such molecules leads to increased instability and thus lower R^2 values.

================================

 To come up with rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value, I can analyze the given list of molecules and their corresponding epsilon R^2 value and observe patterns and similarities between them. Based on this analysis, I can infer the following three rules:
1. Molecules with an aromatic ring (e.g., benzene, pyrrole, pyridine) tend to have higher epsilon R^2 values. This is because the delocalized pi electrons in the aromatic ring can participate in interactions with the solvent, resulting in increased polarization and higher R^2 values.
2. Molecules with multiple halogen atoms (e.g., chlorine, bromine, iodine) tend to have higher epsilon R^2 values. This is because the polarizable electron cloud of the halogen atoms can interact with the solvent, resulting in increased polarization and higher R^2 values.
3. Molecules with hydroxyl groups (e.g., alcohols, phenols) tend to have higher epsilon R^2 values. This is because the hydroxyl group can form hydrogen bonds with the solvent, resulting in increased polarization and higher R^2 values.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher number of double bonds and aromatic rings tend to have higher epsilon R^2 values.
 Rule 2: Molecules with amino groups or carbonyl groups in their structure tend to have lower epsilon R^2 values.
 Rule 3: Molecules with an sp3 hybridized carbon in the alpha position of a carbonyl group tend to have lower epsilon R^2 values.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. The presence of multiple amino groups in a molecule, such as in cationic molecules like [NH3+] and [NH2+], is generally associated with higher R^2 values. This is because these groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds with the solvent, leading to increased solvation and higher R^2 values.
2. The presence of multiple aromatic rings in a molecule, such as in compounds like benzene, pyridine, and pyrimidine, is also associated with higher R^2 values. This is because these rings can form pi-pi interactions with the solvent, leading to increased solvation and higher R^2 values.
3. The presence of multiple functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds, such as in compounds like alcohols, carboxylic acids, and amides, is also associated with higher R^2 values. This is because these groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds with the solvent, leading to increased solvation and higher R^2 values.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. Molecules with aromatic amines tend to have higher R^2 values. For example, Nc1ocnc1OC=O and C#Cc1ccc(NC)[nH]1 have R^2 values of 1212.222412 and 1378.866943, respectively. This can be attributed to the presence of an aromatic ring in the amine moiety, which contributes to the overall stability of the molecule.
2. Molecules with multiple ring systems tend to have lower R^2 values. For example, C[C@@H]1C[C@H](O)C1(C)C and CC[C@H]1C[C@H]1C1CCC1 have R^2 values of 1232.520752 and 1426.103149, respectively. This can be attributed to the increased complexity of the molecular structure, which leads to decreased stability and solubility.
3. Molecules with carbonyl groups tend to have higher R^2 values. For example, CCC[C@H]1C[C@H]1C1CCC1 has an R^2 value of 1426.103149, while its tautomer, CC1(C)C[C@H]2[C@@H](O)[C@H]2O1, has an R^2 value of 1097.727173. This can be attributed to the polarity of the carbonyl group, which enhances intermolecular interactions and therefore increases the R^2 value.

================================

 Based on the given molecules and their corresponding epsilon R^2 values, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. The presence of multiple double bonds or aromatic systems in a molecule generally leads to a higher epsilon R^2 value. For example, molecules such as N#C[C@@H]1C=CCCC[C@@H]1O and C#C[C@H](C)[N@@H+]1[C@H](C)[C@@H]1C have high epsilon R^2 values due to their multiple double bonds and aromatic systems.
2. The presence of amino groups or positive charges in a molecule can also lead to a higher epsilon R^2 value. For example, molecules such as [NH-][C@H]1NCCOC(=O)N1 and C[C@@H]1[C@@H]2[NH2+][CH+]O[C@H]12 have high epsilon R^2 values due to the presence of amino groups or positive charges.
3. The presence of specific functional groups, such as hydroxyl groups or carbonyls, can also affect the epsilon R^2 value. For example, molecules such as C[C@@H]1OC[C@@H]2O[C@H]1C2=O and CC(C)(C)C(O)CO have high epsilon R^2 values due to the presence of hydroxyl groups or carbonyls.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with multiple ring systems or complex structures tend to have higher R^2 values.
Examples: C#C[C@]1(C2CC2)CN1, C[C@@H]1[C@H]2O[C@@H]1CO[C@H]2C, CC1=C(N)C(=O)CC1=O.
Rule 2: Molecules with amino groups or nitrogen-containing functional groups tend to have higher R^2 values.
Examples: C[C@@H]1[C@H]2O[C@@H]1CO[C@H]2C, CC(N)C1OC1=O, N#C[C@H]1C[C@H](N)C([NH-])O1.
Rule 3: Molecules with aromatic rings or conjugated systems tend to have higher R^2 values.
Examples: CO[C@H]1C[C@H]2CC[C@@H]1CN2C(=O)OC(C)(C)C, C#C[C@]1(C2CC2)CN1, CCOC[C@@H](C)NC=O.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three possible rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. Molecules with aromatic amines tend to have higher R^2 values. For example, Cc1cc(N)c(=O)[nH]n1 (R^2 = 1165.964966) and COc1nc(N)[nH]c1O (R^2 = 1226.847412) both contain aromatic amine groups, which could contribute to their high R^2 values.
2. Molecules with multiple reactive groups tend to have lower R^2 values. For example, CC1=C[C@H](O)[C@@H](C)C1 (R^2 = 1327.170166) and CC1=C[C@H](N2CCC2)[C@@H](C)C1 (R^2 = 1408.451129) both have multiple reactive groups that could interfere with the accuracy of the R^2 prediction model.
3. Molecules with certain functional groups tend to have higher or lower R^2 values depending on their position and orientation. For example, C[C@@H]1C[C@@H](C#N)O1 (R^2 = 1005.065186) and CO[C@H]1[C@H]2C(=O)C[C@]21O (R^2 = 1128.021362) both contain a hydroxyl group, but their positions and orientations differ, which could affect their R^2 values. Similarly, C[C@@H]1C[C@@H](C[N+]2(C)CC2)O1 (R^2 = 1522.964844) contains a positively charged species, while COC1(C#N)CNC1 (R^2 = 912.018372) contains a negatively charged species, which could also affect their R^2 values.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the R^2 value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with an aromatic ring or a double bond between a nitrogen atom and a carbon atom tend to have higher R^2 values. For example, Cc1ccc2n1C=CC2 and C#Cc1nccc(N)n1 both have high R^2 values.
2. Molecules with an sp2-hybridized carbon atom bound to an oxygen atom tend to have lower R^2 values. For example, CO[C@@]12[C@@H]3[C@H]4[C@@H]3[C@]1(O)[C@H]42 has a low R^2 value.
3. Molecules with a carbonyl group or a nitrile group tend to have higher R^2 values. For example, C#C[C@@H]1C[C@@]2(C)[C@@H](C)[N@@H+]12 and C[C@@H]1C[C@H]2OC(=O)[C@H]2O1 both have high R^2 values due to the presence of a carbonyl group or a nitrile group.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. Molecules with multiple functional groups such as alcohols, amines, carboxylic acids, and carbonyls tend to have higher R^2 values. For example, CO[C@@H]1C([NH-])O[C@H]1C=O and C[C@@H]1[C@H](CO)[C@@H]2[C@H](O)[C@H]12 have high R^2 values due to the presence of multiple functional groups.
2. Molecules with unsaturated bonds such as alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic compounds tend to have lower R^2 values. This is because these molecules have a more complex structure and can undergo various reactions, resulting in a wider range of possible outcomes. For example, C#C[C@]1(CO)COC1=O has a relatively low R^2 value due to the presence of an unsaturated bond.
3. Molecules with bulky or complex structures tend to have lower R^2 values. This is because these molecules have more degrees of freedom and can undergo a wider range of reactions, leading to a wider range of possible outcomes. For example, CC(C)C[C@]12C[C@H]1CO2 has a relatively low R^2 value due to its bulky and complex structure.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the structure/properties of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. The presence of multiple heteroatoms like nitrogen, oxygen, and/or sulfur in a molecule seems to increase its R^2 value. For example, molecules such as [NH-][CH+]OCc1cn[nH]n1 and C[C@@H](O)c1nc[nH]n1 have high R^2 values. This is because these molecules have more electrons that can participate in the reaction, leading to increased polarizability and higher R^2 values.
2. The presence of multiple conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings also seems to increase the R^2 value. Molecules such as C#CCC1=NO and C#Cc1cc(=O)cc[nH]1 have high R^2 values. This is because these molecules have delocalized electrons that can move easily, leading to increased polarizability and higher R^2 values.
3. The presence of an organic heterotricyclic compound, such as a pyrrolidine, piperidine, or indole, seems to increase the R^2 value. Molecules such as C[C@@H]1O[C@@H]1[C@H]1C[N@H+]1C and C1=CCc2nonc2C1 have high R^2 values. This is because these molecules have complex structures that have many atoms participating in the delocalization of electrons, leading to increased polarizability and higher R^2 values.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. The presence of an amino group (-NH2) in a molecule is positively correlated with a high R^2 value, as it can donate a lone pair of electrons and participate in hydrogen bonding interactions. For example, molecules such as [NH-]C1O[C@@H]2C[C@H]3[C@@H](O2)[C@@H]13 and C[C@H]1NC(=O)[C@@H](O)[C@H]1O have high R^2 values.
2. The presence of an aromatic ring (especially a benzene ring) in a molecule is positively correlated with a high R^2 value, as it can participate in pi-pi stacking interactions. For example, molecules such as C1=Cc2cocc2C1 and C[C@@H]1[C@H]2C=C[C@H]1C2 have high R^2 values.
3. The presence of a polar functional group (such as a carbonyl group (-C=O), a hydroxyl group (-OH), or an organic acid group (-COOH)) in a molecule is positively correlated with a high R^2 value, as it can participate in hydrogen bonding interactions. For example, molecules such as COCC[C@]12CC[C@H]1O2 and O=C1[C@H]2C[C@H]2[C@H]1[NH+]1CC1 have high R^2 values.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher number of atoms tend to have a higher R^2 value.
 Rule 2: Molecules with a higher number of ring structures tend to have a higher R^2 value.
 Rule 3: Molecules with a higher number of functional groups containing nitrogen tend to have a higher R^2 value.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with multiple bonds (e.g., double or triple bonds) tend to have higher R^2 values.
Example: CC[C@H]1OCC=C[C@H]1C, CC[C@H]1C=C[C@H]2C[C@@H]12, O=c1cnc(O)co1, C#C[C@H](C)C(C)(C)C.
Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher R^2 values.
Example: Cn1ncnc1C(N)=O, C[C@@H]1C[C@@H]2CC[C@@H](O2)O1, Cc1onc2c1CNC2, O=C1C[C@H]2C[C@H]3[C@@H]1[N@H+]3C2.
Rule 3: Molecules with charged groups tend to have higher R^2 values.
Example: CC[C@@]1(C#N)C[C@H]2C[C@H]21, C[C@@H]1C[C@@]2(C(=O)O)[C@@H](C)CO2, C[C@@H]1[C@H]2OC[C@]1(C)CO2, N#C[C@H]1NCC[C@H]2O[C@@H]12, COC[C@H]1CC(=O)[C@H]1C.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher R^2 values compared to molecules without aromatic rings. This is because aromaticity leads to more stable and rigid structures, which in turn affects the accuracy of the predictive model.
2. Molecules with multiple functional groups or chiral centers tend to have higher R^2 values compared to molecules with fewer functional groups or chiral centers. This is because molecules with more complex structures are more challenging to model accurately, leading to higher error in the prediction.
3. Molecules with a high number of heavy atoms (such as halogens or metals) tend to have lower R^2 values compared to molecules with a lower number of heavy atoms. This is because the presence of heavy atoms can increase the flexibility and complexity of a molecule, making it harder to predict accurately using machine learning algorithms.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a carbonyl group (C=O or R—CN=O) tend to have higher R^2 values.
 Rule 2: Molecules with an imine group (C=N) tend to have lower R^2 values.
 Rule 3: Molecules with an aromatic ring (C=Cc1ccccc1) tend to have higher R^2 values.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g., C=CC#N, C#CC#N, C#CC1=C[C@@]2(C)C[C@H]2C1) tend to have higher R^2 values.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., Cc1ccn2c1CCC2) tend to have higher R^2 values.
3. Molecules with basic functional groups (e.g., [NH-][C@H]1CO[C@H]2C[C@H](C2)O1, C[N@@H]1C[C@H]2OC([NH-])[C@H]21) tend to have higher R^2 values.

================================

 1. Molecules with multiple rings or complex structures tend to have higher R^2 values.
2. Molecules with functional groups containing nitrogen, oxygen, or other polar elements tend to have higher R^2 values.
3. Molecules with unsaturated bonds or aromatic systems tend to have higher R^2 values.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher R^2 values compared to molecules without aromatic rings.
Rule 2: Molecules with amide groups tend to have higher R^2 values compared to molecules without amide groups.
Rule 3: Molecules with multiple functional groups such as amino, hydroxy, and carboxy groups tend to have higher R^2 values compared to molecules with fewer functional groups.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a cyclic structure tend to have higher R^2 values compared to their acyclic counterparts.
Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have higher R^2 values compared to molecules without such features.
Rule 3: Molecules with amino groups or cyano groups tend to have higher R^2 values compared to molecules without these functional groups.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with multiple rings fused together tend to have higher epsilon R^2 values.
Rule 2: Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g., double or triple bonds) tend to have lower epsilon R^2 values.
Rule 3: Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher epsilon R^2 values.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher R^2 values. This can be observed in molecules such as CC[C@H]1OC([NH2+]C)[C@H]1N, C[C@H]1O[C@H](C)[C@@]1(N)C#N, and CCO[C@@]1(C#N)C[C@H]1N. These molecules contain indole or pyrrole moieties which are known to contribute to high R^2 values.
2. Molecules with unsaturated bonds tend to have lower R^2 values. For example, C#C[C@@]1(O)[C@H](C)[C@@H]1C has a lower R^2 value compared to CC[C@H]1[C@H]2O[C@@H](C=O)[C@@H]12. This is because the C=C bond in the former molecule reduces the molecular stability and therefore decreases the R^2 value.
3. Molecules with basic functional groups such as amino or pyridine moieties tend to have higher R^2 values. This can be observed in molecules such as CC[C@@H]1OC([NH2+]C)[C@H]1N, C[C@H]1O[C@H](C)[C@@]1(N)C#N, and CCO[C@@]1(C#N)C[C@H]1N. These molecules contain amino or pyridine groups which are known to contribute to high R^2 values due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds with other molecules.

================================

 1. Aromaticity: Molecules with more aromatic rings tend to have higher R^2 values. This is because aromatic rings can form strong interactions with other molecules through pi-pi stacking.
2. Polarity: Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower R^2 values. This is because polar molecules can form stronger intermolecular interactions with other polar molecules, which decreases the ability of the molecule to diffuse through the membrane.
3. Hydrogen bonding: Molecules with the ability to form hydrogen bonds tend to have higher R^2 values. This is because hydrogen bonding can increase the stability of the molecule and facilitate its transport across the membrane.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the R^2 value of a molecule based on its structure and properties:
1. Molecules with multiple conjugated double bonds (e.g., C#CCc1[nH]nnc1C) tend to have higher R^2 values compared to molecules without them. This is because the delocalized pi-electron system in these molecules can facilitate the transfer of electrons between the molecule and the solvent, leading to increased polarization and enhanced scattering of light at the solution-air interface.
2. Molecules with functional groups that can donate or accept protons (e.g., amino, hydroxy, carboxy) tend to have lower R^2 values compared to molecules without them. This is because these groups can interact with the solvent through hydrogen bonding, which can disrupt the orderly arrangement of the solvent molecules at the solution-air interface and reduce the overall scattering of light.
3. Molecules with overall positive charges (e.g., [NH-]C1=N[CH+](CO)C=CO1) tend to have lower R^2 values compared to molecules with overall negative charges (e.g., C[NH2+]C1O[C@H]2CN[C@@]12C). This is because the positively charged molecules can repel each other and disrupt the orderly arrangement of the solvent molecules at the solution-air interface, while the negatively charged molecules can attract each other and enhance the scattering of light.

================================

 Based on the given data, we can infer three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. Molecules with a positive charge on the nitrogen atom tend to have a higher R^2 value. For example, NC1[NH2+][C@@H]2C[C@H]1OC2=O (R^2 value: 936.648071) and N#CC[C@@]1([C@H]2CN2)CO1 (R^2 value: 1249.173462) both have a positive charge on the nitrogen atom and relatively high R^2 values.
2. Molecules with an sp2 hybridized carbon atom bonded to a nitrogen atom tend to have a higher R^2 value. For example, Cc1cncn1C1CC1 (R^2 value: 1168.804443) and N#C[C@]12CN3C(=O)[C@H]1[C@@H]32 (R^2 value: 1016.843079) both have an sp2 hybridized carbon atom bonded to a nitrogen atom and relatively high R^2 values.
3. Molecules with an aromatic ring tend to have a higher R^2 value. For example, Cc1ccccc(=O)c1 (R^2 value: 1195.612671) and C[C@@H](O)C([NH-])OC(N)=O (R^2 value: 1395.328857) both have an aromatic ring and relatively high R^2 values.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. The presence of an aromatic ring or a double bond in the molecule can increase the R^2 value. This is because such structures can contribute to the overall stability of the molecule through conjugation or delocalization of electrons, resulting in a more compact and orderly arrangement of atoms.
2. The presence of an amino group or a carboxylic acid group in the molecule can decrease the R^2 value. This is because these groups can introduce flexibility into the molecule through hydrogen bonding or ionic interactions, resulting in a less compact and more disordered arrangement of atoms.
3. The presence of a bulky or complex substituent in the molecule can decrease the R^2 value. This is because such substituents can disrupt the overall symmetry and balance of the molecule, leading to increased conformational freedom and decreased stability.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. Molecules with multiple rings or complex structures tend to have higher R^2 values because they have more features that can be used for classification. For example, the molecule "C[C@@H]1C[N+](C)(C)C[C@H]1[NH-]" has two rings and one chiral center, making it a more complex structure and leading to a higher R^2 value.
2. Molecules with charge or polar functional groups tend to have higher R^2 values because they can participate in electrostatic interactions with the surrounding environment, which can affect their behavior and classification. For example, the molecule "C#CCNC(=O)C1CC1" has a polar carboxylic acid group, making it more likely to interact with other molecules and leading to a higher R^2 value.
3. Molecules with specific functional groups or moieties that are known to exhibit certain biological activities or chemical reactivity tend to have higher R^2 values because they can be targeted or reacted with specific reagents, leading to different behaviors and classifications. For example, the molecule "C[C@@H]1C[C@@H](O)[C@@H](N)C1" has an amino group that is often involved in hydrogen bonding and can be targeted by specific reagents, leading to different behaviors and classifications and a higher R^2 value.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the R^2 value of a molecule based on its structure and properties:
1. Molecules with multiple rings or aromatic systems tend to have higher R^2 values. For example, many of the molecules with high R^2 values, such as C[C@]12CO[C@H]1[C@H]1CC[C@H]12 and C#Cc1cc(N)oc1N, contain multiple rings or aromatic systems.
2. Molecules with hydroxyl groups or amino groups tend to have lower R^2 values. For example, CC(C)[C@H](O)C[C@@H](C)O has a relatively low R^2 value compared to other molecules in the dataset. Similarly, C[C@H]1O[C@H]1C(C)(C)O and C#CCC[C@@H]1C[N@@H+]1CC also have relatively low R^2 values.
3. Molecules with functional groups that are known to participate in chemical reactions, such as carboxylic acids or alcohols, tend to have higher R^2 values. For example, O=C1O[C@@H]2[C@@H]3C(=O)[C@@H]1[C@@H]23 and O=C1[C@@H](O)[C@H]2[C@H]3CN1[C@H]32 both contain carboxylic acid groups and have relatively high R^2 values.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the structure/properties of a molecule to predict the R^2 value:
1. Molecules with a carbonyl group (C=O or aldehyde) tend to have higher R^2 values, as seen in molecules like CC(C)(C)CC(=O)C=O and O=C1C[C@H]2[C@H]3N[C@H]3[C@H]1N2.
2. Molecules with a C#C bond tend to have higher R^2 values, as seen in molecules like C#C[C@](C)(O)COCC and C#CCOCC1(C)CC1.
3. Molecules with a negative charged nitrogen atom (N-) tend to have lower R^2 values, as seen in molecules like [NH-]C1OCc2nnoc21 and N#C[C@H](N)[C@H]1OC[C@H]1O.
