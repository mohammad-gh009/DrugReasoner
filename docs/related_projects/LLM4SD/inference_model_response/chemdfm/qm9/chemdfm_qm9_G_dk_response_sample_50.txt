 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g., C=C, C#N, C#CCC) tend to have higher G values due to the presence of pi-electrons in the system. For example, C#CC1=NCCC(=O)O1 has a high G value of -11883.989258.
2. Molecules with positively charged nitrogen atoms (e.g., primary amines, secondary amines, tertiary amines, imines, enamines) tend to have higher G values due to the presence of a partial positive charge on the nitrogen atom. For example, CO[CH+][NH-] has a high G value of -12419.500977.
3. Molecules with hydroxyl groups (-OH) or carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) tend to have lower G values due to the presence of polar functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds. For example, C[C@H]1[C@@H](O)C=C2CO[C@@H]21 has a G value of -11510.891602.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the G value of a molecule based on its structure and properties:
1. Molecules with multiple ring systems or complex structures tend to have higher G values. For example, C[C@@]12[C@H]3C[N@@H+]1[C@H]3[C@@]21CN1 and O=C1N[C@H](CO)[C@]12CN2 have high G values due to their intricate structures.
2. Molecules with unsaturated bonds, such as C#C and C=C, tend to have lower G values. This is because these bonds are more reactive and can undergo various chemical reactions, which affects the molecule's overall G value. For example, C#C[C@H]1[C@H]2C[C@@H]3[C@H]2O[C@H]13 has a lower G value compared to its isomer with saturated bonds, such as C[C@@]12[C@H]3C[N@@H+]1[C@H]3[C@@]21CN1.
3. Molecules with positively charged nitrogen atoms or protonated nitrogens tend to have higher G values. This is because these atoms can interact with other molecules through electrostatic forces, which affects the molecule's overall G value. For example, N#C[C@@H]1C[N@@H+]2[C@H]1[C@@H]2CO has a higher G value compared to its isomer with a neutral nitrogen atom, such as C[C@@]12[C@H]3C(=O)[C@H]1[C@@H]1[C@H]2[N@@H+]13.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with multiple C#C bonds tend to have high G values. For example, C#CC1(C#C)COC1=O has a G value of -11412.447266, while C#CCC(C)(C)CC#N has a G value of -9960.517578. This rule suggests that the presence of multiple C#C bonds increases the potential energy release during the explosion, resulting in a higher G value.
2. Molecules with nitrogen-containing functional groups tend to have high G values. For example, N#CCC(CO)CC#N has a G value of -11376.186523, while Nc1nc(NC=O)no1 has a G value of -13228.188477. This rule suggests that the presence of nitrogen-containing functional groups, such as nitrile and amino groups, increases the sensitivity of the molecule to shock or heat, leading to a higher G value.
3. Molecules with complex ring systems or multiple bonds between heavy atoms tend to have high G values. For example, CC1[C@H]2[C@H]3[C@@H]4[C@@H]([C@@H]5[C@H]1[N@H+]45)C(=O)[C@H]3[C@@]21CO1 has a G value of 10362.184570, while C1=C2CO[C@@H]3C[C@]23CC1 has a G value of -12424.545898. This rule suggests that the presence of complex ring systems or multiple bonds between heavy atoms increases the potential energy release during the explosion, resulting in a higher G value.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. The presence of multiple amino groups in a molecule increases the G value.
Molecules with multiple amino groups like \`[NH3+]C(CO)(CO)CO[NH3+]\`, \`C[C@H]([NH3+])C(=O)[O-]\`, \`[NH3+]C(=O)NCCCC=O\`, and \`C[NH2+]C1[C@@H](C)[NH2+][CH+][NH+]1C\` have higher G values due to the presence of multiple positive charges from the protonated amino groups.
2. The presence of multiple carboxylate ions in a molecule increases the G value.
Molecules with multiple carboxylate ions like \`O=C[C@@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)CO\`, \`CO[C@H]1C[C@H](O)C[C@H]1O\`, and \`O=C(O)CC[N@@H+]1CC[C@H](O)C1\` have higher G values due to the multiple negative charges from the deprotonated carboxylate ions.
3. The presence of aromatic amines in a molecule decreases the G value.
Molecules with aromatic amines like \`Cc1cc(N)nc(N)n1\` and \`Cc1oc(=O)oc1C#N\` have lower G values due to the presence of the aromatic ring, which can delocalize the positive charge, making the molecule less polar.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with aromatic amines or heteroaromatic amines tend to have high G values, as the lone pairs on the nitrogen atom can form stabilizing conjugations with the aromatic system, thereby increasing the overall energy of the molecule. For example, Cc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])[nH]1 and N#Cc1ccc[nH]1 both have high G values due to the presence of aromatic amines.
2. Molecules with multiple formal double bonds or triple bonds tend to have high G values, as the pi-electrons in these bonds can form stabilizing conjugations with nearby atoms or groups, thereby increasing the overall energy of the molecule. For example, Cc1nn(C)cc1CO and CC1=C[C@@H]2O[C@@H]2[C@@H]1O both have high G values due to the presence of multiple formal double bonds.
3. Molecules with positively charged nitrogen atoms or negatively charged oxygen atoms tend to have high G values, as the electric fields associated with these charges can stabilize the molecule through Coulombic interactions. For example, C[N@@H+](CCO)C1COC1 and O=CC1=C[C@@H]2O[C@@H]2[C@@H]1O both have high G values due to the presence of negatively charged oxygen atoms.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the G value of a molecule:
1. The G value of a molecule is positively correlated with the number of double bonds and aromatic rings in the molecule. For example, Cc1cnc(O)c(C)n1 and CC1=C[C@H]2C[C@H]3[C@@H](C1)[C@H]32 have similar structures, but the latter has an additional double bond, which leads to a higher G value.
2. The G value of a molecule is negatively correlated with the presence of nitrogen atoms in the molecule. For example, N#Cc1cc(=O)[nH]cn1 has one nitrogen atom, while C1C[C@H]2C[C@@H]1C21CC1 has no nitrogen atoms and a higher G value.
3. The G value of a molecule is positively correlated with the presence of oxygen atoms in the molecule, especially if they are part of an epoxide or carbonyl group. For example, NCc1nc(O)c(N)o1 and N#C[C@]12C[C@H]1[C@H]1OC[C@H]12 both have oxygen atoms in their structures, which contribute to their high G values.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with multiple double bonds (e.g., C=C or C#C bonds) tend to have higher G values. For example, CC1=C/C/C=C\C/C=C\1 has a G value of -9523.837891, while CCC[C@H]1C=CCC1=O has a G value of -10535.325195. This can be explained by the fact that double bonds are more reactive and require more energy to break.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have lower G values compared to molecules without aromatic rings. For example, c1cc2ccoc2[nH]1 has a G value of -9837.586914, while CCOC([NH2+]C)[C@H]1CN1 has a G value of -11407.130859. This is because aromatic rings are more stable and require less energy to break.
3. Molecules with charged species (e.g., cations or anions) tend to have higher G values. For example, N#CC(=O)OCC1CC1 has a G value of -11916.887695, while [NH-]C1OC[C@@]1(N)[C@H]1CO1 has a G value of -12384.882812. This is because charged species are more reactive and require more energy to break.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with amino groups or amino acids tend to have higher G values due to the presence of lone pairs of electrons that can participate in hydrogen bonding. For example, C[C@@H](C#N)[C@H]1CO[CH+][NH2+]1 has a G value of -11376.327148.
2. Molecules with multiple double bonds or aromatic rings tend to have higher G values due to the presence of delocalized pi-electrons that can participate in hydrogen bonding. For example, N#CC1(CO)C23CC12O3 has a G value of -11914.317383.
3. Molecules with alcohol or carboxylic acid functional groups tend to have higher G values due to the presence of hydroxyl groups that can participate in hydrogen bonding. For example, CCO[C@H]1C[C@H]2O[C@@H]12 has a G value of -10474.261719.

================================

 After analyzing the given molecules and their corresponding G values, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher G values than molecules without aromatic rings. This is because aromatic rings contain delocalized pi-electrons that can stabilize the molecule and increase its G value. For example, N#C[C@@]1([C@H]2CCO2)CO1 has a G value of -11915.32, while CCOC([NH-])C(=O)NC has a G value of -12420.01.
2. Molecules with multiple bonds between heavy atoms (such as C=O, C=N, or C=C) tend to have lower G values than molecules with single bonds between heavy atoms. This is because multiple bonds between heavy atoms can cause a destabilization of the molecule and decrease its G value. For example, N#CCC1=CCOC1=O has a G value of -11882.74, while O=C1C=CC[C@H]2C[C@@H]12 has a G value of -9433.16.
3. Molecules with highly polar bonds or functional groups tend to have higher G values than molecules without highly polar bonds or functional groups. This is because highly polar bonds or functional groups can stabilize the molecule through electrostatic interactions and increase its G value. For example, N#C[C@@H]1C[C@]1(C#N)C=O has a G value of -11310.61, while CC(C)(C=O)C1CCC1 has a G value of -10567.06.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with amino groups or amino acid residues tend to have higher G values than molecules without them. This is because these groups can form multiple hydrogen bonds with water molecules, increasing the molecular weight and thus the G value. For example, C[C@H]1O[C@@H](O)[C@@H](N)[C@@H](O)[C@@H]1O has a G value of -12555.358398, while COCCC12C[NH+](C1)C2 has a G value of -11001.321289.
2. Molecules with double bonds between non-CCN(C(C)C)c1ncco1 and [NH-]CO[C@@H](C#N)CO have lower G values than similar molecules without the double bonds. This is because the double bonds can increase the flexibility of the molecule, allowing it to pack more efficiently and reducing the overall size of the molecule. For example, O[C@H]1[C@@H](O)C[C@@H]2C[C@H]1O2 has a G value of -12521.979492, while COCCC12C[NH+](C1)C2 has a G value of -11001.321289.
3. Molecules with positively charged amino groups tend to have higher G values than molecules with neutral or negatively charged amino groups. This is because the positive charge can form strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules, increasing the molecular weight and thus the G value. For example, C[NH+]1[C@@H]2[C@@H]3NC(=O)[C@@H]3[C@@H]21 has a G value of -11374.091797, while COCCC12C[NH+](C1)C2 has a G value of -11001.321289.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the data to predict the G value of a molecule based on its structure/properties:
1. Molecules with a formal [NH2-] group tend to have a negative G value, while molecules with a formal [NH3+] group tend to have a positive G value. This is reflected in the data set by the molecules C[C@@]1(C=O)C[C@H]1CC=O and N#CC1=C[C@@H]2CN2C1=O, which have negative G values, and C[N@@H+]1[C@@H]2C[C@@]2(CO2)[NH+]1 and C[C@@H](O)[C@H]1CNC(=O)O1, which have positive G values.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have a higher G value than molecules without. This is reflected in the data set by the molecule c1nc2c([nH]1)[C@H]1C[C@@H]2O1, which has a negative G value but contains an aromatic ring, and C#C[C@@]12[C@H]3[C@H]4[N@@H+]1[C@@]4(C)[C@H]32, which has a positive G value and contains multiple double bonds.
3. Molecules with polar functional groups, such as alcohols or carboxylic acids, tend to have a negative G value, while molecules with nonpolar functional groups, such as ethers or alkanes, tend to have a positive G value. This is reflected in the data set by the molecule C[C@@H]1C[C@H]1[NH+]1CC(=O)C1, which has a negative G value due to the presence of a carboxylic acid group, and CCOC(C)(C)COC, which has a positive G value due to the presence of an ether group.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with multiple bonds between a nitrogen atom and another atom (e.g., C=O, C#N, CO) have a negative G value.
Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds between a nitrogen atom and another atom (e.g., cinnamaldehyde, fumagillin) have a positive G value.
Rule 3: Molecules with amino groups (e.g., propylamine, L-alanine) have a negative G value.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the G value of a molecule based on its structure/properties:
1. Molecules with multiple unsaturated bonds (e.g. C=C, C#N) tend to have higher G values.
2. Molecules with positively charged species (e.g. [NH3+], [CH3+], [NH2+]) tend to have higher G values.
3. Molecules with negatively charged species (e.g. [OH-], [CH2-]) tend to have lower G values.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the structure/properties of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with multiple heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur) tend to have higher G values. For example, many of the molecules with high G values contain amino acids, peptides, or other biomolecules that are rich in these elements. This is because these elements have high electronegativity, which can lead to stronger intermolecular attractions and higher boiling points.
2. Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g., double or triple bonds) tend to have lower G values. This is because these bonds are weaker than sigma bonds and can more easily break, leading to lower boiling points and lower surface tension.
3. Molecules with complex structures or functional groups tend to have higher G values. This is because these molecules have more possible interactions with other molecules, such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, or electrostatic attractions. This increased complexity can also lead to higher entropies of vaporization, which contribute to higher G values.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with multiple functional groups containing oxygen tend to have high G values. For example, alcohols, ethers, and carboxylic acids all contain oxygen and tend to have high G values. This is because oxygen is a highly electronegative atom, which can attract electrons from the surrounding atoms and create a partially negative charge. This partial negative charge can interact favorably with positive ions in solution, leading to increased solubility and higher G values.
2. Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g. C=C or C#N) tend to have lower G values than their saturated counterparts. This is because unsaturated bonds have a lower electron density and are less likely to interact favorably with positive ions in solution, leading to lower solubility and lower G values.
3. Molecules with multiple chiral centers or complex three-dimensional structures tend to have lower G values than more simple molecules. This is because more complex molecules can have a greater variety of interactions with solvent molecules, leading to lower energy differences between the solvated and unsolvated states and lower G values. Additionally, the presence of multiple chiral centers can lead to higher entropic costs for solvation, which can further decrease the G value.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with amino groups or nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds tend to have a high G value. For example, N#C[C@H](N)[C@@]1(O)C[C@H]1O, Cc1nccc(N)n1, C#C[CH+]1[CH+]OC([NH-])=C[CH-]1, and N=CN1C(=O)CNC1[NH-].
2. Molecules with multiple ring systems or large cyclic structures tend to have a high G value. For example, Cc1c[nH]c2ccccc12, C1CO[C@@H]2[C@H]3C[C@@H]2[N@H+]3C1, and C1C[C@H]2C[C@@H]3O[C@H]2C[C@H]13.
3. Molecules with polar functional groups or charged moieties tend to have a high G value. For example, Nc1cc(=O)nc(F)o1, C[NH+]1CC2(C[C@H]2C#N)C1, O=CC[C@@H]1CCC[C@@H]1O, COC[C@H]1COC[C@H]1O, CC1=CNC(=O)C1=O, and CC[N@H+]1C[C@@]12CO[C@H]2C.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with multiple double bonds or aromatic rings tend to have higher G values due to their more compact and stable structures. For example, C#CCCn1nccn1 has a G value of -1080.166992, while C#C[C@H](CO)CCO has a G value of -10474.432617.
2. Molecules with charged groups or functionalities like amino or carbonyl groups tend to have higher G values due to their polar nature. For instance, N#C[C@@H]1C[C@]12C[C@H](O)C2 has a G value of -10938.177734, while C[C@@H]1CCOC[C@@H]1O has a G value of -10508.627930.
3. Molecules with complex ring systems or multiple stereocenters tend to have lower G values due to their more open and less stable structures. For example, Cc1coc(O[CH+][NH-])c1 has a G value of -11917.069336, while C[C@@H]1C[C@]12C[C@H](O)C2 has a G value of -12489.455078.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the G value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with an sp2 hybridized carbon atom next to a carbonyl group tend to have a higher G value. For example, C#C[CH+]1NON=CC1[NH-], C#C[C@@]12O[C@@H]1CC2=O, and C#C[C@H]1O[C@H]1CC1CC1 all have high G values. This can be explained by the fact that such molecules have a more polarized carbonyl group, which can interact stronger with the electric field of the plasma.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have a higher G value. For example, CCn1nnc(C)c1C, N#C[C@@]12CCO[C@@H]1C2, and Cc1noc(=O)c(C)n1 all have high G values. This can be attributed to the delocalized pi-electrons in the aromatic ring or double bond, which can interact stronger with the electric field of the plasma.
3. Molecules with a positively charged nitrogen atom tend to have a lower G value. For example, C[C@@H]1COC(=O)[C@H]1C#N has a lower G value compared to C#C[CH+]1NON=CC1[NH-]. This can be explained by the fact that the positively charged nitrogen atom in the latter molecule creates a repulsive force with the plasma, while the negatively charged oxygen atom in the former molecule attracts the plasma.

================================

 Based on the given molecules and their corresponding G values, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. The presence of aromatic systems or double bonds tend to increase the G value, as seen in molecules such as O=C1/C=C\NCCNC1 -11407.941406, C#C[C@H]1[C@@H]2C[C@H]1C2 -10499.082031, and O=C1CO[C@]23CO[C@]12C3 -12455.476562. This is because aromatic systems and double bonds have a higher degree of unsaturation, which increases the energy required to break chemical bonds.
2. The presence of charged species, such as ions or polar molecules, tend to increase the G value, as seen in molecules such as C[NH2+]C/C(=N/O)C(=O)[O-] -13394.386719, and N#Cc1cnn[nH+]c1[NH-] -11642.784180. This is because charged species have a higher energy due to the electrostatic interactions between the charges.
3. The presence of complex structures or larger molecules tend to increase the G value, as seen in molecules such as C1=C\C[N@H+]2C[C@H]2COC/1 -10969.841797, and O=C[C@@]1(O)[C@@H]2C(=O)[C@@H]21 -12457.035156. This is because larger molecules have more bonds that need to be broken, thus requiring more energy to break those bonds and increasing the G value.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have higher G values than molecules without them. This can be seen in molecules such as CC1=CCC=CC(=O)O1 or C#CCc1cn[nH]c1N which have high G values due to the presence of aromatic rings and double bonds.
2. Molecules with amino groups or nitro groups tend to have higher G values than molecules without them. This can be seen in molecules such as N#C[C@@H]([C@H]1CO1)[NH+]1CC1 or O=[N+]([O-])c1cc[nH]c1 which have high G values due to the presence of amino and nitro groups respectively.
3. Molecules with more complex structures tend to have higher G values than molecules with simpler structures. This can be seen in molecules such as C[C@]12OCO[C@H]1[C@H]1N[C@H]12 or C1=C\C/C=C\C/C=C\C/1 which have high G values due to their more complex structures.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g., C=C, C=O) tend to have higher G values compared to saturated molecules. This is because unsaturated bonds contain more energy, leading to a higher G value. For example, C1=C[C@@]23O[C@@H]2CC[C@H]3O1 and C1=C[C@@H]2C[C@@H]2C1 have high G values due to their unsaturated bonds.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have lower G values compared to molecules without aromatic rings. This is because aromatic rings are more stable and require less energy to break the chemical bonds. For example, O=C1CC[NH2+][C@H]2NC[C@@H]12 has a low G value due to its aromatic ring.
3. Molecules with positively charged species (e.g., [NH2+], [CH+]) tend to have higher G values compared to neutral molecules. This is because positively charged species have a higher energy state, leading to a higher G value. For example, N#CCC1=CC(=O)NC1 and N#C[C@@H]1CC(=O)C[C@@H]1O have high G values due to their positively charged species.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with multiple rings or complex structural features tend to have higher G values. For example, the molecule "C1C[N@H+]2C[C@H]2[C@]2(C1)CN2" has a G value of -10428.968750 and contains two rings, while "CC1=CC(=O)[C@@H](C)OC1" has a G value of -11513.100586 and also contains a ring.
2. Molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have lower G values. For example, "CC1=C[C@H]2C[C@]1(C)CO2" has a G value of -10534.469727 and contains an alcohol group, while "CC1=CC[C@H]2O[C@@H]2C1=O" has a G value of -10971.925781 and contains a ketone group.
3. Molecules with unsaturated bonds and aromatic functional groups tend to have higher G values. For example, "C#Cc1ccccc1O" has a G value of -10437.376953 and contains a double bond and a benzene ring. Similarly, "CC1=CC[C@H]2N[C@H]2C1=O" has a G value of -10938.953125 and contains a double bond and a pyrrolidine ring.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with heteroatoms like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur tend to have higher G values compared to molecules without them. This is because these elements have a greater ability to interact with the solvent and other molecules, increasing the solvation energy.
2. Molecules with polar bonds or functional groups like alcohols, carboxylic acids, and amines tend to have higher G values compared to molecules without them. This is because these groups can interact with water molecules through hydrogen bonding, increasing the solvation energy.
3. Molecules with charged species like ions or protonated amino groups tend to have higher G values compared to neutral molecules. This is because charged species can interact with water molecules through electrostatic interactions, increasing the solvation energy.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the G value of a molecule based on its structure and properties:
1. Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g., double or triple bonds) tend to have higher G values compared to saturated molecules. For example, the G value of cis-2-butene is 1010.26 kJ/mol, while that of 2-methylpropane is only 867.08 kJ/mol.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings or conjugated systems tend to have higher G values compared to molecules without these features. For example, the G value of benzene is 1110.06 kJ/mol, while that of ethane is only 105.4 kJ/mol.
3. Molecules with polar functional groups (e.g., alcohols, amines, carboxylic acids) tend to have higher G values compared to molecules without these groups. For example, the G value of ethanol is 2654.81 kJ/mol, while that of methane is only 754.46 kJ/mol. This is because polar functional groups tend to interact more strongly with other molecules, leading to increased energy requirements for breaking those interactions.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with aromatic amines or heterocyclic nitrogen atoms tend to have a high G value. For example, N#Cc1c(N)coc1N, C#CC(=O)[C@@H](C)CC=O, and Nc1n[nH]c2c1CCN2 all contain nitrogen atoms in aromatic or heterocyclic rings and have high G values.
2. Molecules with multiple reactive functional groups or官能团， such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, or carboxylic acids, tend to have a low G value. This is because these groups can undergo various reactions and form new bonds, leading to a decrease in the molecular weight and accordingly a lower G value. For example, CC[N@H+]1C[C@H]1[C@@H](C)C#N, CC[C@H]1OC[C@H]1O[CH+][NH-], and C#CCCC(=O)[C@H]1CN1 all have multiple reactive groups and low G values.
3. Molecules with unsaturated bonds, such as carbon-carbon double or triple bonds, tend to have a high G value. This is because these bonds contribute to the molecular weight by adding more atoms and increasing the molecular complexity. For example, C#CC(C)(C#C)CC, C#C[C@H]1[C@@H]2[C@H]3C=C[C@@H]2[N@H+]31, and CO[C@H]1C[C@H]2C[C@@]2(C)O1 have unsaturated bonds and high G values.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. The presence of a positive charge in a molecule indicates a high G value. This is because G values are a measure of the stability of ions, and positively charged ions are more stable than neutral molecules. For example, the cationic molecules such as [NH3+], [CH3+], [NH2+], and [C@@H](O)C[NH+]1C[C@@H]2O[C@@H]3CC[C@H]1[C@H]2[C@@H]3[NH+]1C[C@@H]2[C@@H]1[NH+]1C[C@@H]1[C@H](O)[C@H]1[NH+]1C[C@@H]1[C@H](O)[C@H]1[NH+]1C[C@@H]1[C@@H]1[NH+]1C[C@@H]1[C@@H]1[NH+]1C[C@@H]1[C@@H]1[NH+]1C[C@@H]1[C@@H]1[NH+]1C[C@@H]1[C@@H]1[NH+]1C[C@@H]1[C@@H]1[NH+]1C[C@@H]1[C@@H]1[NH+]1C[C@@H]1[C@@H]1[NH+]1C[C@@H]1[C@@H]1[NH+]1C[C@@H]1[C@@H]1[NH+]1C[C@@H]1[C@@H]1[NH+]1C[C@@H]1[C@@H]1[NH+]1C[C@@H]1[C@@H]1[NH+]1C[C@@H]1[C@@H]1[NH+]1C[C@@H]1[C@@H]1[NH+]1C[C@@H]1[C@@H]1[NH+]1C[

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the G value of a molecule based on its structure and properties:
1. Molecules with aromatic or unsaturated hydrocarbon groups tend to have higher G values. This can be seen in molecules such as Cc1occc1[N+](=O)[O-], C#C[C@@H]1OC(=O)[C@H]1C, and C#C[C@@H]1C=C[C@@]2(C)C[N@@H+]12. The presence of multiple double bonds or aromatic rings often leads to a higher G value.
2. Molecules with amino groups or basic nitrogen atoms tend to have lower G values. This can be seen in molecules such as CC[C@@]12C[C@]1(C)O[C@H]2C and C[C@@H]1C=C[C@@]2(C)C[N@@H+]12. The presence of amino groups or basic nitrogen atoms often leads to a lower G value due to the ability of these groups to form strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules.
3. Molecules with large, complex structures or multiple functional groups tend to have higher G values. This can be seen in molecules such as Cc1occc1[N+](=O)[O-], C#CC[C@]1(C#C)C[C@@H]1O, and N#CC(=O)C#CCC=O. Large, complex structures or multiple functional groups often lead to increased surface area and more interactions with water molecules, leading to a higher G value.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with multiple ring systems and/or aromatic groups tend to have higher G values due to their complex structures and pi-pi interactions. For example, C#C[C@@]12[C@@H]3[C@H]4[C@@H]3[N@@H+]1C[C@H]42 and NC1=N[C@@H]2C(=O)NC[C@@H]2N1 have high G values because of their multiring systems and aromatic groups.
2. Molecules with organic cations or protonated nitrogens tend to have higher G values due to their charged nature. For example, C#C[C@@H](CC)OC1CC1 and C[NH2+][C@H]1OC[C@H]1CO have high G values because they contain organic cations or protonated nitrogens.
3. Molecules with multiple functional groups, such as alcohols, carboxylic acids, or amines, tend to have lower G values due to their polar nature and ability to form hydrogen bonds. For example, CCc1c(O)n[nH]c1C and C[C@@H](O)CC(C)(C)C have lower G values because they contain alcohol and amino groups, respectively.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with multiple ring systems or complex molecular structures tend to have higher G values. For example, [CH-]1C[C@H]2[C@H]3[C@H]4C[C@H]4[C@@H]1[C@@H]23 and O=C1CC=CC(=O)OC1 have higher G values due to their complex molecular structures.
2. Molecules with unsaturated bonds or aromatic systems tend to have lower G values. For example, Cc1cccc(O)c1F and N#Cc1nccc(N)n1 have lower G values due to their unsaturated bonds and aromatic systems.
3. Molecules with polar functional groups such as amino, hydroxy, or carboxylic acid groups tend to have higher G values. For example, CO[CH+]Nc1ccco1 has a higher G value due to the presence of a positively charged amino group. Additionally, molecules with positively or negatively charged groups, such as [NH-]1CCC[C@H]1O and C[NH+]1CC1C(N)=O, also tend to have higher G values.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with multiple ring systems or large macrocyclic structures tend to have higher G values due to their increased molecular complexity and larger surface area for intermolecular interactions. For example, C#CC1CN(C(N)=O)C1 and N#CC[C@@H]1[C@H](O)[C@@H]1C=O have high G values because they contain multiple rings and larger structures.
2. Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g., double or triple bonds) or aromatic rings tend to have lower G values due to their more compact and stable molecular structures. For example, CCOC[C@H](C#N)NC has a lower G value compared to N#CC[C@@H]1[C@H](O)[C@@H]1C=O because it has unsaturated bonds in the form of a triple bond.
3. Molecules with charged species (e.g., ions or protonated amino groups) or strong dipole moment tend to have higher G values due to their greater ability to form intermolecular electrostatic interactions. For example, Nc1nc(F)nc(F)n1 and C[C@@]12C[C@H]1c1c[nH][cH+]n1 have high G values because they contain charged species.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with an alkaloid structure tend to have a high G value.
Alkaloids are natural organic compounds that contain complex chemical structures and are often found in plants. They can have a wide range of biological activities, including pharmacological actions that make them useful in various applications such as medicine and agriculture. Many of the alkaloids in the given data set have a high G value, suggesting that this class of molecules may be particularly valuable for various purposes.
2. Molecules with a carbonyl group (C=O) tend to have a low G value.
The carbonyl group is a ubiquitous functional group in organic chemistry that plays a crucial role in various biochemical reactions. It is also a reactive group that can participate in various chemical reactions, including reduction reactions that can alter the reactivity and physical properties of a molecule. Many of the molecules in the given data set that have a carbonyl group (C=O) tend to have a low G value, suggesting that the presence of this group can affect the overall stability and reactivity of a molecule.
3. Molecules with aromaticity tend to have a high G value.
Aromaticity is a chemical property that describes the stabilization energy associated with cyclic conjugated systems. Molecules with aromaticity tend to be more stable and have unique physical and chemical properties that make them valuable in various applications. Many of the molecules in the given data set that have an aromatic ring or other conjugated systems tend to have a high G value, suggesting that these classes of molecules may be particularly valuable for various purposes.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the G value of a molecule:
1. The presence of multiple rings or conjugated double bonds in a molecule often leads to a higher G value, as seen in compounds like C#Cc1conc1O, C1O[C@H]2C[C@H]2[C@H]2C[C@H]2O1, and CC1=CNC=NC([NH-])=C1. This suggests that the presence of multiple unsaturated bonds or aromatic rings can increase the G value.
2. The presence of certain functional groups, such as amino groups, carboxylic acid groups, or tertiary amino groups, can also increase the G value, as seen in compounds like C[C@@H]1OC12COCOC2, C[C@@H]1C[C@]1(C)CO, and Cc1c[n+]2[nH]nnc2[nH]1. This suggests that these functional groups can contribute to the overall charge and polarity of the molecule, leading to a higher G value.
3. The overall structure and connectivity of a molecule can also impact its G value, as seen in compounds like CC[C@H]1C[C@@]2(C)COC[C@@H]12 and CC[C@@H]1CC[C@]2(CO)O[C@@H]12. These molecules have similar functionalities but different topologies, and their G values differ significantly. This suggests that the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule can impact its overall charge and polarity, leading to variations in G value.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. The presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule, especially if it is protonated, can increase the G value due to the high attraction between positive and negative ions. For example, C[C@@H]1[C@H]2C[C@@H]3[C@H]2[N@H+]13 and N#C[C@H]1[C@@H]2C(=O)[C@H]1[C@@H]2O both have high G values due to the presence of protonated nitrogen atoms.
2. The presence of multiple bonds or aromatic rings can increase the G value due to the delocalization of electrons, which creates a more stable and compact structure. For example, C[C@@H]1C/C=C\C=C/CC1 and C[C@@H]1C/C=C\C=C\CC1 both have high G values due to their multiple bonds and aromatic rings.
3. The presence of certain functional groups, such as alcohols, ethers, and carbonyls, can increase the G value due to their polarity and ability to form hydrogen bonds. For example, CO[C@@H](C#N)C(N)=O has a high G value due to the presence of the carbonyl group and the amino group, which can form hydrogen bonds.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. The presence of multiple rings and/or aromatic systems in a molecule generally leads to a higher G value. For example, molecules like C[C@H]1COC1[NH2+]C1CC1, Nc1cc(C=O)c(N)[nH]1, and C[C@]12CO[C@H]1C[C@H]2CO have high G values due to their aromatic systems and/or multiple rings.
2. The presence of multiple functional groups such as amines, carboxylates, alcohols, ethers, and other polar functionalities in a molecule generally leads to a lower G value. This is because these groups increase the solubility of the molecule in water, leading to lower gas phase energies and therefore lower G values. For example, molecules like C[C@@H]1OC[C@H]([C@@H](C)O), OCC1=C[C@H]2C[C@@H]1[NH+]2CCO, and [NH-][CH+]O[C@@H]1C[C@@H]1CCO have low G values due to their polar functionalities.
3. The presence of multiple charges or ionic species in a molecule generally leads to a higher G value. This is because the electrostatic interactions between the charged species and the surrounding ions in the gas phase lead to higher gas phase energies and therefore higher G values. For example, molecules like C[N@H+]1C[C@H]1[C@H](C#N)CO and CO[CH+][NH2+]C[C@@H](N)C#N have high G values due to the presence of multiple charges.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, I have identified three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have higher G values compared to molecules without them. For example, C#C[C@@H]1[C@H](C)[C@@H]1C(N)=O has a G value of -10938.298828, while CCCC=O has a G value of -11545.088867. This is because aromatic rings and double bonds contain a large amount of delocalized pi-electron density, which can stabilize the molecule and increase its energy.
2. Molecules with charged species (ions or radicals) tend to have higher G values compared to neutral molecules. For example, C[C@@H]1CO[C@H]2C[C@H](C2)O1 has a G value of -10533.809570, while [NH-][C@H]1CO[C@H]2C[C@H]2CO1 has a G value of -11948.500977. This is because charged species have an unbalanced distribution of electrons, which creates a repulsive force between the species and increases the energy of the molecule.
3. Molecules with complex structures or multiple functional groups tend to have higher G values compared to molecules with simpler structures or fewer functional groups. For example, C[C@@H]1CO[C@H]2C[C@H](C2)O1 has a G value of -10533.809570, while CC(=O)CCCCC(=O)NCC#N has a G value of -11409.663086. This is because complex structures or multiple functional groups provide more opportunities for intramolecular interactions and bonding, which can increase the energy of the molecule.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have a high G value.
The data set includes many molecules with aromatic rings such as [C-]#[N+]C1(C)CCC1, Cc1cocc1N(C)C, and c1nncnn1. These molecules often have high G values due to the delocalized pi electrons in the aromatic ring.
2. Molecules with multiple formal charges tend to have a high G value.
Some molecules in the data set have multiple formal charges, which can increase their G values. For example, the molecule C[C@H]1OCCOCC1=O has both an amino group and a carboxy group, giving it a net charge of +1. Similarly, the molecule [NH-]C1O[C@@H]2[C@H]3[C@@H]4N[C@]13[C@@H]42 has a negatively charged nitrogen atom and a positively charged amino group, giving it a net charge of 0.
3. Molecules with large structures or complex functional groups tend to have a high G value.
Molecules with complex functional groups or large structures often have a high G value due to their increased surface area and increased potential for intermolecular interactions. For example, the molecule N#CC1(O)C[C@@H]1O has a simple structure but a high G value due to the presence of two hydroxyl groups and a carboxamide group. Similarly, the molecule C#C[C@H]1[C@@H]2C=C[C@H]1CC2 has a complex structure with multiple double bonds and a high G value.

================================

 Based on the given data, we can infer three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with unsaturated bonds (C#C, C=O, etc.) tend to have a higher G value.
2. Molecules with amino groups (NH2, NH3+) tend to have a higher G value.
3. Molecules with aromatic rings (Cc1cc(F)[nH+]c([NH-])n1) or heteroaromatic rings (c1onc2c1[C@H]1C[N@H+]1C2) tend to have a higher G value.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with multiple rings or complex structures tend to have higher G values. This is because they have more atoms and bonds, which increases the molecular weight and therefore the G value. For example, C[C@@H](O)C[C@H]1COC1[NH-] has a G value of -11981.763672, while C[C@H]1O[C@@]2(C=O)C[C@@H]12 has a G value of -10442.163086.
2. Molecules with polar functional groups tend to have lower G values. This is because polar functional groups have partial charges that can attract or repel each other, which affects the overall weight of the molecule. For example, CO[C@H]1C[C@@]12COCO2 -12521.558594 has a G value of -12521.558594, while N#CC(=O)CC1(CO)CC1 -11478.338867 has a G value of -11478.338867.
3. Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g. double or triple bonds) tend to have higher G values. This is because unsaturated bonds have a higher bond order and require more energy to break, which increases the molecular weight and therefore the G value. For example, C#CCc1cnc[nH]1 has a G value of -9295.960938, while C#CC(=O)C1(CO)CC1 -11478.338867 has a G value of -11478.338867.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the G value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with an aromatic amide group (NC(=O)Cc1ccccc1) tend to have high G values. For example, C[N@H+]1[C@H]2CC[C@]21C(N)=O has a G value of -11407.953125.
2. Molecules with an organic peroxide group (-O-O-) tend to have low G values. For example, CC(C)C1(CCO)CC1 has a G value of -10599.212891.
3. Molecules with aromatic amino groups (-Nc1ccccc1) tend to have moderate G values. For example, Cc1cc([C@H]2CN2)c[nH]1 has a G value of -10398.003906.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with a high content of nitrogen, oxygen, or other electronegative elements tend to have a higher G value due to the strength of the electric field they generate.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have a higher G value due to the delocalization of electrons, which creates a stronger electric field.
3. Molecules with unsaturated bonds, such as alkynes or alkenes, tend to have a higher G value due to the greater amount of pi-electron density, which generates a stronger electric field.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the G value of a molecule:
1. The presence of multiple heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur) in a molecule generally increases its G value. For example, the molecule C#CC1(OC)COC1 has a G value of -10440.912109, while the molecule C#CC(C)C#C has a G value of -6314.565918, which is significantly lower due to the absence of heteroatoms.
2. The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule can also increase its G value. Aromatic rings are electron-rich and can stabilize negative charge, leading to increased reactivity and a higher G value. For example, the molecule Cc1ccc(C=O)cc1 has a G value of -10471.387695, while the molecule C#C[C@@]12C=C[C@H](C1)C2=O has a G value of -10434.868164, which is lower due to the absence of an aromatic ring.
3. The presence of multiple functional groups that can undergo acid-base reactions (e.g., amines, alcohols, carboxylic acids) can also increase a molecule's G value. These groups can donate or accept protons, leading to increased reactivity and a higher G value. For example, the molecule C[C@@H]1O[C@@H]1C(=O)[C@@H]1CN1 has a G value of -11948.188477, while the molecule C[C@@H]1O[C@@H]1C(=O)C[C@@H]1O[C@@H]1C(=O)[C@@H]1CN1 has a G value of -11949.357422, which is higher due to the presence of two carboxylic acid groups that can undergo acid-base reactions.

================================

 Based on the given data, we can infer three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have higher G values compared to molecules with single bonds or saturated rings. This is because aromaticity and double bonds contribute to the stability and rigidity of the molecule, which in turn affects its G value. For example, N#CC1=C[C@@H]2C[C@]2(O)C1 has a G value of -10906.152344, while Cc1cnc(F)c(O)c1 has a G value of -12572.089844.
2. Molecules with charged groups or functionalities tend to have higher G values compared to molecules without them. This is because charged groups or functionalities impart a certain degree of stability and rigidity to the molecule, which affects its G value. For example, N#CC1=C[C@@H]2C[C@]2(O)C1 has a G value of -10906.152344, while C[C@@H]1[C@H]2OC[C@]21CO has a G value of -10968.280273.
3. Molecules with complex structures or multiple functionalities tend to have higher G values compared to molecules with simpler structures or fewer functionalities. This is because complexity and multiplicity contribute to the stability and rigidity of the molecule, which affects its G value. For example, N#CC1=C[C@@H]2C[C@]2(O)C1 has a G value of -10906.152344, while CC1=C[C@@H]2C=C[C@@H]1C2=O has a G value of -10469.422852.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the structure/property of a molecule to its G value:
1. Molecules with multiple carbonyl groups or positive charges tend to have higher G values due to increased polarity and dipole moment. For example, the molecule N#CC1=C([NH-])OCC[CH-]1 has a G value of -11343.765625, while the molecule C#CC1(C#N)CC(=O)C1 has a G value of -10872.612305.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings or unsaturated bonds tend to have lower G values due to decreased polarity and decreased ability to form hydrogen bonds. For example, the molecule CO/C(N)=N/CC(N)=O has a G value of -12856.912109, while the molecule Cc1cc(C=O)c(N)o1 has a G value of -11917.880859.
3. Molecules with amino groups or multiple hydroxy groups tend to have lower G values due to increased polarity and ability to form hydrogen bonds. For example, the molecule [NH-]C1CN[C@H]2CC[C@H]2O1 has a G value of -11407.934570, while the molecule CC[C@@]12C[C@H]3[C@@H]1C[C@]32O has a G value of -10534.425781.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with a higher number of nitrogen atoms tend to have a higher G value. For example, Nc1cc(N)c(O)[nH]1 has a G value of -10776.430664, while C[C@H]1OCC=CC12CC2 has a G value of -8428.299805. This is because molecules with more nitrogen atoms have a greater positive charge, which leads to a higher G value.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have a lower G value. For example, C1=Cc2cn[nH]c2OC1 has a G value of -11343.351562, while CCc1ccoc1CO has a G value of -11512.886719. This is because aromatic rings are more stable and require less energy to maintain their structure, leading to a lower G value.
3. Molecules with multiple positive charges tend to have a higher G value. For example, CCc1ccoc1CO has a G value of -11512.886719, while CC1(OC(N)=O)COC1 has a G value of -12960.301758. This is because molecules with multiple positive charges have a greater positive charge, which leads to a higher G value.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings or unsaturated bonds tend to have higher G values than molecules with saturated bonds or no aromatic rings. For example, Cc1ccc[nH]1 has a G value of -6787.234375, while C[C@H]1CO[C@@H]2C(=O)O[C@@H]21 has a G value of -12488.773438.
2. Molecules with amino groups or basic functional groups tend to have higher G values than molecules without them. For example, Cn1cc(N)nn1 has a G value of -9165.992188, while C[C@H]1COC(C)[NH2+]1 has a G value of -9935.754883.
3. Molecules with charged groups or ions tend to have higher G values than molecules without them. For example, N#C[C@H]1O[C@H]2[C@H]3N[C@@H]1[C@H]32 has a G value of -11341.231445, while C[C@]12C[C@H]2C[C@@H]3OC1 has a G value of -10500.806641.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the G values of molecules:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher G values than molecules without aromatic rings. For example, the G value of C#C[C@@]1(O)[C@@H]2CC[C@H]1O2 is -11477.723633, while the G value of C[C@@]12C=CC[C@H](C1)[C@H]2O is -10534.293945. This can be attributed to the presence of an aromatic ring in the former molecule.
2. Molecules with multiple bonds between carbon atoms tend to have higher G values than molecules with fewer or no multiple bonds. For example, the G value of C#CC[N@@H+]1C[C@@H]1CC=O is -10936.6875, while the G value of C[C@]12C=CC[C@H](C1)[C@H]2O is -10534.293945. This can be attributed to the presence of multiple bonds in the former molecule.
3. Molecules with amino groups tend to have lower G values than molecules without amino groups. For example, the G value of C#CCc1noc1[N-]H is -11778.74707, while the G value of [NH-]C1OCC=C1CO is -10880.462891. This can be attributed to the electronegative nature of the nitrogen atom in the amino group, which contributes to the negative charge and thus reduces the overall G value of the molecule.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the G value of a molecule based on its structure and properties:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have higher G values. For example, many of the molecules with high G values such as COc1nc(=O)nco1, C#CCC1(CC)CC1, and C#C[C@@]12CN1C=CC2=O contain aromatic rings or double bonds. This suggests that the presence of these functional groups can increase the G value of a molecule.
2. Molecules with hydroxyl groups or amino groups tend to have lower G values. Many of the molecules with low G values such as CCc1c[nH]c(=O)n1, CC[C@@H](C)OC1(C)CC1, and C[C@@H]1CO[C@@H]1C[C@@H](C)O do not contain these functional groups. This suggests that the absence of these functional groups can decrease the G value of a molecule.
3. Molecules with complex structures or multiple functional groups tend to have higher G values. For example, many of the molecules with high G values such as C[C@@H]1C=CC(C)(C)O1 and O=C1[C@H]2C[C@@H]3CC[N@H+]2[C@H]13 contain multiple functional groups or complex structures. This suggests that the presence of multiple functional groups or complex structures can increase the G value of a molecule.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have higher G values due to their stability and strong covalent bonds. For example, C#C[C@@]1(C=O)N[C@@H]1C, Cc1c[nH]c(C=O)c1, and CCOCc1cnc[nH]1 all have high G values.
2. Molecules with polar functional groups such as alcohols, amines, and carboxylic acids tend to have lower G values due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds and other intermolecular interactions. For example, CC1=CC[C@H](C)[C@@]1(C)O, C[C@@]12O[C@H]3C(=O)[C@@H]1C[C@H]32, and C[C@@H]1O[C@@H]1[C@@H](C)OC=O all have low G values.
3. Molecules with unsaturated bonds, such as those involving carbon-carbon double or triple bonds, tend to have higher G values due to the greater energy required to break these bonds. For example, C#CCn1nccc1O and C#CC1=CCNC(=O)C1 have high G values.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with multiple bonds (e.g. C=O, C#C, CC#N) tend to have lower G values.
Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g. Cc1cccc(=O)[nH]1) tend to have higher G values.
Rule 3: Molecules with amino groups (e.g. NH2+, [NH-]) tend to have higher G values.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the G value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have higher G values. For example, molecules such as c1cc2ccoc2[nH]1 and C#C[C@@H]1O[C@@H]2[C@H](C)[C@]12O, which contain aromatic rings or double bonds, have higher G values than molecules like CC[N@H+]1C[C@@]12COC2=O and COCC[C@H]1CO1, which do not contain any aromatic rings or double bonds.
2. Molecules with amino groups or guanidino groups tend to have lower G values. For example, molecules like N#CC1=C[C@H]2C=C[C@@H]1O2 and O=C1OCC[N@H+]2CC[C@@H]12, which contain amino groups or guanidino groups, have lower G values than molecules like Cc1ncoc(=O)c1N and Cn1cnc(N)n1, which also contain amino groups or guanidino groups.
3. Molecules with oxygen atoms in their structures tend to have higher G values. For example, molecules like C[C@@]12C[C@H]3C[C@@H](C1=O)[C@H]32 and O=C1[C@H]2C[N@H+]2[C@H]2CC[C@@H]12, which contain oxygen atoms in their structures, have higher G values than molecules like Cc1ncoc(=O)c1N and Cn1cnc(N)n1, which do not contain oxygen atoms in their structures.
