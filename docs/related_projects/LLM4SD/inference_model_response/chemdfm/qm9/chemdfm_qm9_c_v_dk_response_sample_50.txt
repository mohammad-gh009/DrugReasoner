 RULE 1: The Cv value is positively correlated with the number of double bonds in the molecule. This means that the more double bonds a molecule has, the higher its Cv value will be. For example, C#CCc1nc(C)no1 and C#Cc1cnc(O)cn1 both have one double bond and have Cv values of 30.295000 and 27.528000, respectively.
RULE 2: The Cv value is negatively correlated with the molecular weight of the molecule. This means that the heavier a molecule is, the lower its Cv value will be. For example, C#CC[C@H](N)C1(O)CC1 has a molecular weight of 128.04 g/mol and a Cv value of 37.395000, while c1c[nH]ccncnc1 has a molecular weight of 116.15 g/mol and a Cv value of 28.688000.
RULE 3: The Cv value is positively correlated with the number of basic nitrogen atoms in the molecule. This means that the more basic nitrogen atoms a molecule has, the higher its Cv value will be. For example, C[C@@](N)(C#N)C1(O)CC1 has a Cv value of 37.395000, while C[C@@H](O)CN[C@@H](C)C#N has a Cv value of 38.797001, even though they have different structures. Both molecules have one basic nitrogen atom.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Cv value:
1. Molecules with multiple formaldouble bonds tend to have higher Cv values than molecules without them. For example, C#CC#C[C@@H](C)C#C has a Cv value of 31.861000, while CC1=CC([NH-])O[C@H]2C[C@@H]12 has a Cv value of 30.760000. This can be attributed to the presence of two double bonds in the former.
2. Molecules with amino groups or nitrogen-containing rings tend to have lower Cv values than molecules without them. For example, N#CCn1cc[nH]c1=O has a Cv value of 27.673000, while Cn1nnc(N)c1O has a Cv value of 28.466999. This can be explained by the fact that nitrogen is less electronegative than oxygen, which results in a lower overall polarity and thus a lower Cv value.
3. Molecules with organic frameworks containing oxygen atoms tend to have higher Cv values than molecules without them. For example, CO[C@@H]1[C@@H]2O[C@H]1[C@@H]1N[C@@H]12 has a Cv value of 29.195999, while C#CC[C@]1(COC)CN1 has a Cv value of 36.396999. This can be attributed to the fact that oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, which results in a higher overall polarity and thus a higher Cv value.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Cv value:
1. Molecules with multiple ring systems or complex architectures tend to have higher Cv values due to increased structural complexity. For example, [NH-]C1O[C@@H]2CC=C[C@]12O has a Cv value of 29.271999, while Cc1cc(O)cc(F)n1 has a Cv value of 29.488001, both of which have multiple rings and complex architectures.
2. Molecules with hydroxyl groups or amino groups tend to have lower Cv values due to their polar nature, which can affect the stability of the molecule. For example, C#CC[C@H]1O[C@H]2C[C@H]2O1 has a Cv value of 30.832001, while C[C@@H](O)C#C[C@H]1CN1 has a Cv value of 31.674000, both of which contain hydroxyl groups.
3. Molecules with unsaturated bonds, such as C#C and C=C bonds, tend to have higher Cv values due to increased reactivity and instability. For example, C#CCC(F)(F)F has a Cv value of 23.455999, while C#CC[C@H]1O[C@H]2C[C@H]2O1 has a Cv value of 30.832001, both of which contain unsaturated bonds. This is because unsaturated bonds can undergo various reactions, making the molecule less stable and more reactive.

================================

 RULE 1: Molecules with a higher Cv value tend to have a more complex structure, with multiple rings, functional groups, or chiral centers.
EXAMPLES:
* N=CNc1ncnnn1 (Cv = 25.937) vs. O=C1CCC(=O)N1C (Cv = 26.818)
* C[C@@H]1C[C@H]2C[C@@H]2N1C (Cv = 38.834) vs. C[C@@H]1CC(=O)N1C (Cv = 26.818)
RULE 2: Molecules with a higher Cv value tend to have a greater number of atoms, particularly heavy atoms like nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur.
EXAMPLES:
* N#C[C@@]12O[C@@H]1COC2=O (Cv = 25.554) vs. C[C@@H]1C[C@H]2C[C@@H]2N1C (Cv = 38.834)
* C[C@@H]1C[C@H]2C[C@@H]2N1C (Cv = 38.834) vs. C[C@@H]1CC(=O)N1C (Cv = 26.818)
RULE 3: Molecules with a higher Cv value tend to have a more polar or ionizable nature, often due to the presence of charged groups, polar bonds, or polar functional groups.
EXAMPLES:
* C[N@H+]1[C@@H]2[C@H]1[C@@]1(C#N)C[C@@H]21 (Cv = 29.811) vs. C[C@@H]1C[C@H]2C[C@@H]2N1C (Cv = 38.834)
* C[C@@H]1C[C@H]2C[C@@H]2N1C (Cv = 38.834) vs

================================

 1. Molecules with a cyclic structure tend to have a higher Cv value compared to their acyclic counterparts.
2. Molecules with multiple bonds (e.g. double or triple bonds) tend to have a higher Cv value compared to molecules with single bonds.
3. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have a higher Cv value compared to molecules without aromatic rings.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Cv value:
1. Molecules with multiple rings or complex structures tend to have higher Cv values due to their increased surface area and molecular complexity. For example, the molecule "Cc1cc(=O)nc(N)o1" has a Cv value of 30.415001, while the molecule "CC(C)=O" has a Cv value of 34.655998, which is higher despite having a simpler structure.
2. Molecules with charged or polar functional groups tend to have higher Cv values due to their increased solubility and interaction with water molecules. For example, the molecule "C[C@H]1C[C@@H]1CCO" has a Cv value of 30.459999, while the molecule "C#CC#CC(=O)CCO" has a Cv value of 34.312000, which is higher despite having a similar structure.
3. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have lower Cv values due to their increased stability and reduced polarity. For example, the molecule "CC[C@@H]1C[C@H]1CCO" has a Cv value of 30.459999, while the molecule "CCC1(CC)OC[C@H]1C" has a Cv value of 39.929001, which is higher despite having a similar structure.

================================

 1. Molecules with a higher number of carbon atoms tend to have a higher Cv value.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have a higher Cv value.
3. Molecules with amino groups tend to have a lower Cv value.

================================

 RULE 1: Molecules with a higher number of heavy atoms (i.e. atoms with an atomic number > 11) tend to have a higher Cv value.

RULE 2: Molecules with a higher number of double bonds or triple bonds tend to have a higher Cv value.

RULE 3: Molecules with a higher number of functional groups containing nitrogen atoms tend to have a higher Cv value.

================================

 1. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher Cv values than molecules without aromatic rings.
2. Molecules with multiple functional groups or heteroatoms tend to have higher Cv values than molecules with fewer functional groups or heteroatoms.
3. Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g. C=C or C=O) tend to have higher Cv values than molecules with saturated bonds.

================================

 Based on the data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the Cv value of a molecule:
1. The presence of multiple heteroatoms (e.g. N, O, F) in a molecule generally correlates with a higher Cv value. This is evidenced by molecules such as [NH-]C1=NC=CC(F)O1, N#C[C@]12O[C@@H]3[C@@H](O)[C@H]1[C@@H]32, and Cn1cnc(=O)c(F)n1, which all have high Cv values.
2. Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g. C=O, C=C) or aromatic rings tend to have lower Cv values. For example, CCOCCC(=O)NC has a relatively low Cv value despite having a complex structure, because it contains an aromatic ring and multiple unsaturated bonds.
3. Molecules with simple structures and a single functional group often have lower Cv values. This is exemplified by molecules such as C[C@@H]1O[C@@H]([NH-])[C@]1(O)C=O and CC(=O)[C@@]1(C)COC1[NH-], which both have only one functional group and simple structural components.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the Cv value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with an aldehyde group have a higher Cv value than molecules without one.
2. Molecules with a cyclic structure tend to have a lower Cv value than molecules without one.
3. Molecules with a positive charge on a nitrogen atom have a higher Cv value than molecules without one.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the Cv (Caryå€¼) of a molecule based on its structure/properties:
1. Molecules with multiple double bonds (e.g., C#CC1(C#C)C[N@@H+]1C) or aromatic systems (e.g., Cc1c(F)ccnc1O) tend to have higher Cv values. This is because these functional groups can undergo oxidation or reduction reactions, which can alter the molecule's charge and thus its Cv value.
2. Molecules with amino groups (e.g., COCC(O)(CO)CO) or carbonyl groups (e.g., COCC(=O)O[C@H](C)[NH-]) can have high Cv values due to the ability of these groups to donate or accept protons, respectively. This can result in the formation of positively or negatively charged species, which can alter the molecule's Cv value.
3. Molecules with flexible structures (e.g., C1=C[C@H]2CC=C3C[C@@H]1[C@H]32) or those with potential for intramolecular interactions (e.g., O=C1C[N@H]2C[C@H]3C[C@H]3[C@@H]12) tend to have lower Cv values. This is because these molecules have less structural complexity and therefore fewer opportunities for redox reactions or ionization events to occur, which can influence the Cv value.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, we can infer three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Cv value:
1. Molecules with aromatic amines or tertiary amino groups tend to have a higher Cv value, as seen in molecules like [NH-]C1OCO[C@H]2CC[C@@H]12, Cc1cnc(C)cn1, and C#CC(O)(C#C)CC#N. This is because these functional groups can undergo deprotonation, which leads to the formation of negative ions and an increase in the overall polarity of the molecule, resulting in a higher Cv value.
2. Molecules with carbonyl groups or multiple bonds tend to have a lower Cv value, as seen in molecules like CC(=O)[C@H]1C[C@]2(CN2)C1, CC(=O)NC(=N)CC#N, and C#C[C@@H]1N[C@@]1(CC)CO. This is because these groups can increase the lipophilicity of the molecule, leading to reduced solubility in water and a lower Cv value.
3. Molecules with hydroxyl groups or carboxylic acid groups tend to have a moderate Cv value, as seen in molecules like O=C[C@H](O)C1(O)CCC134.757999, OCC(CO)C[C@H]1CO1 36.515999, and C[C@]1(O)CC[C@@H]2C[C@@]21C 37.396999. This is because these groups can increase the polarity of the molecule but also allow for hydrogen bonding with water, leading to increased solubility and a moderate Cv value.

================================

 Sure! Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Cv value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have higher Cv values due to their planar structures and delocalized pi-electrons.
2. Molecules with amino groups or carboxylic acid groups tend to have lower Cv values due to their polar nature and ability to form hydrogen bonds.
3. Molecules with multiple stereocenters or chiral centers tend to have higher Cv values due to their increased structural complexity and potential for conformational isomers.

================================

 RULE 1: Molecules with aromaticity have high Cv values.
 Examples: Nc1cc2ncoc2o1, Nc1cc2c([nH]1)COC2, N#C[C@]12[C@@H]3N[C@H]1C(=O)[C@@H]32.
 RULE 2: Molecules with heterocyclic rings have high Cv values.
 Examples: Cc1occc(=O)c1C, C#CCOC[C@@H]1C[N@@H+]1C, O=C1[C@@H](O)CC[C@H]2O[C@@H]12.
 RULE 3: Molecules with positively charged species have high Cv values.
 Examples: CO[C@H]1O[CH+][NH2+]C12CC2, CC[C@H]1OC[C@H]2[C@@H]1[N@H+]2C, CC[C@@]1(CO)O[C@H]1CO.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Cv ( Collision Cross Section ) value:
1. Molecules with multiple charges tend to have higher Cv values due to their increased surface area and electrostatic interactions. For example, many of the peptides and proteins in the dataset have multiple charges, which contributes to their relatively high Cv values.
2. Molecules with complex structures or flexible regions tend to have higher Cv values. This is because these molecules have more surface area and can adopt a wider range of conformations, increasing their potential for collisions with other molecules. Examples of such molecules include polyether antibiotics like erythromycin and vancomycin, which have complex structures with multiple loops and loops.
3. Molecules with aromatic rings or unsaturated bonds tend to have lower Cv values compared to molecules with more aliphatic structures. This is because aromatic rings and unsaturated bonds tend to be more rigid and less likely to adopt multiple conformations, reducing the overall surface area and collision possibilities. For example, molecules like caffeine and L-tryptophan have aromatic rings in their structures, which contribute to their relatively low Cv values.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Cv value:
1. Molecules with multiple functional groups containing nitrogen atoms tend to have higher Cv values due to their greater polarity and ionizable nature. For example, compounds like [NH-][CH+]O[C@H]1O[C@H]2C[C@@H]1C2 and N#CC#Cc1cocn1 have high Cv values due to the presence of multiple amino groups.
2. Molecules with unsaturated bonds, such as alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic systems, tend to have lower Cv values compared to molecules with only saturated bonds. This is because unsaturated bonds introduce more complexities into the molecular structure, which can increase the overall energy required for vaporization. For example, compounds like C#C[C@H](O)[C@@]1(CO)CO1 and C#C[C@H](O)c1cnc[nH]1 have low Cv values due to their unsaturated bond content.
3. Molecules with more complex architectures or greater molecular weights tend to have higher Cv values due to their increased surface area and greater number of intermolecular forces. For example, compounds like [NH-][CH+]O[C@H]1O[C@H]2C[C@@H]1C2 and C#CC1=C([NH-])OCC[CH-]1 have high Cv values due to their more complex molecular architectures.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, I have identified three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Cv value:
1. Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g., C#CCCOC=O, C#CCc1nccnn1) tend to have higher Cv values compared to molecules with saturated bonds. This is because unsaturated bonds have a higher degree of energy and thus require more energy to break and form new bonds.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., C#CC[C@H](C)C(=O)CC) tend to have higher Cv values compared to molecules without aromatic rings. This is because aromatic rings have a high degree of stability and thus require more energy to break.
3. Molecules with charged groups (e.g., [NH-][CH+]OCCC(F)(F)F, N#C[C@@H]1O[C@]1(C#N)CN) tend to have higher Cv values compared to molecules without charged groups. This is because charged groups have a higher degree of polarity and thus require more energy to separate the charges.
It is important to note that these rules are not absolute and there may be exceptions. However, these rules provide a good starting point for predicting the Cv value of a molecule based on its structure and properties.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Cv value:
1. Molecules with aromatic amines tend to have high Cv values. For example, Nc1cc2[nH]cnc2[nH]1 has a Cv value of 28.680000 and Nc1c(O)nnoc1=O has a Cv value of 29.041000. This can be attributed to the presence of the lone pairs of electrons on the nitrogen atom, which can delocalize over the aromatic ring, leading to an increase in Cv value.
2. Molecules with positively charged species tend to have higher Cv values. For example, [NH-]C1=CC(CO)CCO1 has a Cv value of 31.827999, while its conjugate acid [CH+]1N[C@H]2[C@H]3C45OC34[C@]25[NH2+]1 has a Cv value of 34.376999. This is because positively charged species have a greater amount of delocalized charge, leading to an increase in Cv value.
3. Molecules with multiple functional groups tend to have higher Cv values. For example, CC[NH2+][C@@H]1O[C@H]2C[C@]21C has a Cv value of 34.376999, while its conjugate base C1=C[C@H]2CC[C@@H]3[C@H]1[C@H]1C=C[C@@H]3[C@@H]21 has a Cv value of 27.590000. This can be attributed to the presence of multiple functional groups that can delocalize charge, leading to an increase in Cv value.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Cv value:
1. Molecules with multiple rings or large structures tend to have higher Cv values. For example, Cc1cc([C@H]2CN2)n[nH]1, C[C@]12[C@@H]3O[C@@H]123, and C1=C2NC[C@@H]3C[C@H]([CH-]1)N23 have high Cv values due to their complex structures.
2. Molecules with charged groups or reactive functional groups tend to have higher Cv values. For example, CC1=C(C)[C@H]2C[C@@H](C1)C2, C#C[C@H](CC#N)OCC, and O=C[C@]12[C@@H]3O[C@@H]123 have high Cv values due to the presence of charged groups or reactive functional groups like acetate, cyanide, and ketone.
3. Molecules with conjugated systems or aromatic rings tend to have higher Cv values. For example, CC#CC[C@@H]1C[C@H](O)CC1=O has a high Cv value due to the presence of a conjugated system, and Cc1cc([C@H]2CN2)n[nH]1 has a high Cv value due to the presence of an aromatic ring.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, I have inferred the following three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Cv value:
1. Molecules with multiple functional groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, amines, and carboxylic acids tend to have higher Cv values due to increased polarity and solvation. For example, C#C[C@]1(C)C[C@H]1CO (Cv = 33.895000) has both an alcohol and an alkyne group, which contributes to its higher Cv value.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have lower Cv values due to their nonpolar nature. For example, CC[C@@H]1[C@H](C)[C@@H]1CC (Cv = 37.191002) has a single bond and no aromatic rings, which results in a lower Cv value.
3. Molecules with charged species such as ammonium ions, carboxylate ions, and organic cations tend to have higher Cv values due to their increased polarity and solvation. For example, C[N@@H+]1C[C@@H]1C#N (Cv = 33.319000) has an ammonium ion that contributes to its higher Cv value.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, I have identified the following three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to its Cv (molar volumetric capacity) value:
1. Molecules with multiple rings or complex structures tend to have higher Cv values than molecules with simpler structures. For example, Cc1c(F)ccnc1O has a Cv value of 29.046, while CC1=C[C@@H](C)CCC1 has a Cv value of only 24.716. This can be attributed to the fact that more complex molecules have more atoms and bonds, which lead to increased surface area and greater interaction with the solvent.
2. Molecules with functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds tend to have lower Cv values than molecules without such groups. Hydrogen bonds reduce the solvent accessibility of the molecule, leading to decreased interaction with the solvent and lower Cv values. For example, CCO[C@@H]1[C@H](O)[C@@H]2C[C@@H]21 has a Cv value of 34.660, while Cc1[nH]nc2nnoc12 has a Cv value of 26.128. The former has hydroxy and ether functional groups, which can form hydrogen bonds, while the latter is a planar molecule with no hydrogen bond-forming groups.
3. Molecules with unsaturated bonds and aromatic systems tend to have higher Cv values than molecules with saturated bonds. This can be attributed to the fact that unsaturated bonds and aromatic systems have greater surface area and stronger intermolecular forces, leading to increased interaction with the solvent and higher Cv values. For example, C#C[C@@H]1[CH-]C=C(NO)C1 has a Cv value of 29.7169, while CC1=C[C@@H](C)CCC1 has a Cv value of only 24.716. The former has an unsaturated bond and an aromatic system, while the latter is a saturated molecule with no aromatic system.

================================

 1. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have higher Cv values. This is because these functional groups increase the surface area of the molecule, leading to increased intermolecular interactions and solubility.
2. Molecules with multiple ring systems or complex structures tend to have higher Cv values. This is because these molecules have more potential for intermolecular interactions and can form more extensive hydrogen bonding networks.
3. Molecules with charged or ionic functional groups tend to have higher Cv values. This is because these groups can form strong electrostatic interactions with water molecules, leading to increased solubility and higher Cv values.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Cv value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher Cv values than molecules without aromatic rings. This is because aromatic rings have a stable structure that can delocalize electrons, which increases the stability of the molecule and therefore increases its Cv value.
2. Molecules with amino groups tend to have lower Cv values than molecules without amino groups. This is because amino groups have a negative charge that can be balanced by positive ions, which decreases the overall stability of the molecule and therefore decreases its Cv value.
3. Molecules with multiple bonds between non-carbon atoms (e.g. N-N bonds) tend to have higher Cv values than molecules with fewer or no multiple bonds between non-carbon atoms. This is because multiple bonds between non-carbon atoms can delocalize electrons and increase the stability of the molecule, which increases its Cv value.

================================

 1. Molecules with a higher Cv value tend to have a more complex structure, with multiple ring systems or aromatic systems.
2. Molecules with a higher Cv value tend to have a more unsaturated nature, with multiple double or triple bonds.
3. Molecules with a higher Cv value tend to have more polar functional groups, such as alcohols, amines, carboxylic acids, or esters.

================================

 1. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher Cv values than molecules without aromatic rings.
2. Molecules with multiple functional groups, such as ketones, amines, and alcohols, tend to have higher Cv values than molecules with fewer functional groups.
3. Molecules with more complex structures, such as those containing multiple rings or long chains, tend to have higher Cv values than molecules with simpler structures.

================================

 RULE 1: Molecules with a higher number of double bonds have a higher Cv value.
EXAMPLES: C#CCC[C@H]1CO[CH+][NH2+]1 (31.868999) vs. CC[C@H]1[C@H](C(N)=O)[N@H+]1C (37.486000). The first molecule has two double bonds, while the second only has one.
RULE 2: Molecules with aromatic rings have a higher Cv value.
EXAMPLES: Cc1n[nH]nc1/N=C/N (31.490999) vs. C[C@@]1(OC=O)C[C@H]1O (35.734001). The first molecule has an aromatic ring, while the second does not.
RULE 3: Molecules with more complex functional groups have a higher Cv value.
EXAMPLES: N#C[C@@H]1C=C[C@H](O)C1=O (29.205999) vs. CC1(C)[C@H]2N[C@@]13CO[C@@H]23 (33.049999). The first molecule has a simple functional group, while the second has a more complex one.

================================

 After analyzing the given molecules and their corresponding Cv values, three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Cv value are:
1. Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g., double or triple bonds) tend to have higher Cv values compared to saturated bonds. This is because unsaturated bonds have a higher potential for covalent bonding with other molecules, which can lead to increased stability and a higher Cv value. For example, molecules C#CC[C@H](N)C(=O)O and N#C[C@@H]1NC[C@@H]1O[CH+][NH-] both have multiple unsaturated bonds, and they have relatively high Cv values of 35.318001 and 30.466999, respectively.
2. Molecules with more complex structures (e.g., aromatic rings, multiple functional groups) tend to have higher Cv values compared to simpler molecules. This is because complex molecules have a greater number of covalent bonds and a higher potential for interactions with other molecules, which can lead to increased stability and a higher Cv value. For example, molecule C[C@@H]1C[C@@](O)(CO)C1 has a relatively simple structure but still has a relatively high Cv value of 38.766998 due to the presence of two hydroxyl groups and one keto group.
3. Molecules with more charged species (e.g., protonated or deprotonated nitrogens) tend to have higher Cv values compared to neutral molecules. This is because charged species have a greater potential for interactions with other molecules, which can lead to increased stability and a higher Cv value. For example, molecule C[N@H+]1C(N)C[C@H]1C(=O)[O-] has a Cv value of 33.319000 due to the presence of a protonated nitrogen and a deprotonated carboxylic acid group.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the Cv (Council of Viterbo) value of a molecule based on its structure/properties:
1. Molecules with an sp2 or sp3 hybridized carbon bonded to a carbonyl group (C=O, COC, etc.) have a higher Cv value compared to other molecules.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have lower Cv values compared to molecules without these features.
3. Molecules with amino groups (NH2+) or positively charged nitrogen atoms (CH+, NH+, [NH-]) have a higher Cv value compared to molecules without these groups.

================================

 After analyzing the given molecules and their corresponding Cv values, three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Cv value are:
1. Molecules with multiple rings or complex structures tend to have higher Cv values. For example, C#C[C@@]12O[C@@H]1CO[C@@H]2C has a Cv value of 31.681, while C[C@@H]1CO[C@@H]1CC#N has a Cv value of 34.082. This is because the former has two rings and a more complex structure, while the latter has only one ring and a simpler structure.
2. Molecules with amino groups or other basic functional groups tend to have lower Cv values. For example, N#C[C@@]12CC[C@@H](CN1)C2 has a Cv value of 29.641, while [NH-]C1OCC[C@@H]1C(N)=O has a Cv value of 30.452. This is because the basic groups in the molecules can donate electrons and increase the overall negative charge of the molecule, which leads to a lower Cv value.
3. Molecules with multiple double bonds or aromatic systems tend to have higher Cv values. For example, C#CC(=O)n1cnnc1 has a Cv value of 26.257, while C[C@H]1C[C@]2(C[C@H]2CO)C1 has a Cv value of 37.214. This is because multiple double bonds or aromatic systems can increase the overall conjugation and delocalization of electrons in the molecule, leading to a more complex structure and higher Cv value.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher Cv value tend to have a more complex structure, often involving multiple rings, aromatic systems, or heteroatoms.
Rule 2: Molecules with a higher Cv value tend to have a greater number of functional groups, such as alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines, or heterocycles.
Rule 3: Molecules with a higher Cv value tend to have a greater number of stereocenters, which can lead to increased structural complexity and variability in physical and chemical properties.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the Cv value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with multiple double bonds (e.g., C#CCCO[C@H](C)C=O) tend to have higher Cv values compared to molecules with single bonds only.
2. Molecules that contain positively charged nitrogen atoms (e.g., [NH-][C@@H]1OCC=C[C@H]2C[N@@H+]12) tend to have higher Cv values compared to molecules without positively charged nitrogen atoms.
3. Molecules that contain aromatic rings (e.g., Cc1ccncc1C) tend to have lower Cv values compared to molecules that do not contain aromatic rings.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the Cv value of a molecule:
1. The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O or C=Cc1ccccc1) is associated with a higher Cv value.
2. The presence of an amino group (-NH2 or -NH-) is associated with a lower Cv value.
3. The presence of a double bond between a nitrogen atom and a carbon atom (R-N=N-R) is associated with a higher Cv value.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the Cv value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with aromatic amines tend to have a high Cv value. For example, CCc1cc(N)co1 has a Cv value of 30.084999.
2. Molecules with positively charged nitrogen atoms in their structure tend to have a high Cv value. For example, C[C@@H]1[C@H](C=O)[C@@H]2CC[C@H]12 has a Cv value of 33.155998.
3. Molecules with multiple rings and/or long chains tend to have a high Cv value. For example, C[C@@H]1O[C@@H](CO)[C@@H]1(C)O has a Cv value of 38.070000.
It is important to note that these rules are based on the given data and may not hold true for all molecules. Additional data and analysis may be needed to come up with more accurate predictions.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher number of carbon atoms tend to have a higher Cv value.
Explanation: This can be inferred from the data set, where molecules such as CC[C@@]1(O)CC#N (Cv = 36.541) and C[C@]12C[C@@H](CC#N)C[C@H]1N2 (Cv = 32.719) have more carbon atoms in their structures, leading to higher Cv values.
Rule 2: Molecules with a higher number of oxygen atoms tend to have a lower Cv value.
Explanation: This can also be inferred from the data set, where molecules such as COc1cnc(C#N)o1 (Cv = 27.371) and O=c1ccoc(F)c1 (Cv = 22.239) have fewer oxygen atoms in their structures, leading to lower Cv values.
Rule 3: Molecules with a higher number of nitrogen atoms and aromatic rings tend to have a higher Cv value.
Explanation: This rule can be inferred from the data set, where molecules such as N#C[C@@]12[C@@H]3N[C@H]4[C@@H]3[N@@H+]1[C@H]42 (Cv = 24.338) and Cn1nc(N)ccc1=O (Cv = 30.735) have a higher number of nitrogen atoms and aromatic rings, leading to higher Cv values.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the Cv value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher Cv values than molecules without aromatic rings. For example, N#Cc1ccn(C=O)c1 has a Cv value of 26.659000, while COc1n[nH]cc1C=O has a Cv value of 29.129000. This could be due to the presence of double bonds and aromaticity in the former molecule.
2. Molecules with multiple formal double bonds or triple bonds tend to have higher Cv values than molecules with fewer or no formal double bonds or triple bonds. For example, C#CCCC(C)(C)O has a Cv value of 40.550999, while CCC1=CC[C@H]2[C@@H](C)[C@@H]12 has a Cv value of 35.643002. This could be due to the increased reactivity and energy associated with multiple formal double bonds or triple bonds.
3. Molecules with amino groups tend to have lower Cv values than molecules without amino groups. For example, N#Cc1ccn(C=O)c1 has a Cv value of 26.659000, while Cc1cc([NH-])nc(O)[nH+]1 has a Cv value of 30.797001. This could be due to the electronegative nature of the nitrogen atom, which decreases the overall energy of the molecule.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Cv value:
1. Molecules with multiple rings or complex ring systems tend to have higher Cv values. For example, C1[C@H]2C[C@@H]3C[C@@H](C[C@H]13)O2 has a Cv value of 27.201000, while Cc1nc(C)[nH]c(=O)n1 has a Cv value of 30.379000. This is because molecules with more complex structures often have more atoms and bonds, which can lead to increased instability and thus a higher Cv value.
2. Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g., double or triple bonds) tend to have lower Cv values than molecules with only single bonds. For example, CC#C[C@H]1CC([NH2+]C)O1 has a Cv value of 34.081001, while CC[C@H]1C[C@H]2OCC=C12 has a Cv value of 32.735001. This is because unsaturated bonds are more stable than single bonds, and therefore molecules with unsaturated bonds tend to be less reactive and have lower Cv values.
3. Molecules with functional groups that are known to be unstable (e.g., aldehydes, ketones) tend to have higher Cv values. For example, C=CC[C@]12CC=C[C@H]1O2 has a Cv value of 29.986000, while CCOC(=O)N1CC1 has a Cv value of 29.656000. This is because functional groups that are unstable can undergo reactions more easily, which can lead to increased instability and thus a higher Cv value.

================================

 Based on the data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the Cv value of a molecule:
1. The Cv value is positively correlated with the number of double bonds in a molecule. Molecules with more double bonds tend to have a higher Cv value.
For example, C#CCOC([NH-])C(C)C has a Cv value of 37.835999, while its isomer, C#CC1=C[C@@]2(C)N[C@H]2C1, has a Cv value of 32.786999. The only difference between these two molecules is the presence of an extra double bond in the C#CC1=C[C@@]2(C)N[C@H]2C1 molecule.
2. The Cv value is negatively correlated with the number of rings in a molecule. Molecules with more rings tend to have a lower Cv value.
For example, CO[C@@H]1C=C[C@@H]2N[C@@H]2C1 has a Cv value of 32.101002, while its isomer, O=C1[C@H]2O[C@H]2[C@H]2CO[C@@H]12, has a Cv value of 25.809000. The only difference between these two molecules is the presence of one more ring in the CO[C@@H]1C=C[C@@H]2N[C@@H]2C1 molecule.
3. The Cv value is positively correlated with the presence of amino groups in a molecule. Molecules with more amino groups tend to have a higher Cv value.
For example, NC(=O)c1cc(N)n[nH]1 has a Cv value of 31.278999, while its isomer, N#C[C@H](N)[C@H]1CCOC1, has a Cv value of 36.973999. The only difference between these two molecules is the presence of an additional amino group in the N#C[C@H](N)[C@H]1

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher Cv value tend to have a more complex structure, often containing multiple rings or functional groups.
Examples: CC1=C[C@@H]2[C@H]3C=C[C@@H]2[C@@H]13, C#C[C@@H]1[C@H](C#N)C[C@@H]1C, C[C@@H]1C[C@]2(C[C@H]3O[C@H]32)C1.
Rule 2: Molecules with a higher Cv value tend to have a more polar structure, containing multiple functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds.
Examples: C[C@@H]1O[C@H]1C#CC(N)=O, C[C@H]1O[C@H]1C#CC(=O)OCC(C)C, C[N@@H+]1[C@@H]2C(=O)[C@H]1[C@@H]2C#N.
Rule 3: Molecules with a higher Cv value tend to have a more reactive structure, containing multiple functional groups that can participate in chemical reactions.
Examples: C#CC[C@@H]1OC1(C)C, C[N@H+]1[C@H]2C(=O)[C@H]1[C@@H]2C#N, C[C@@H]1O[C@H]1C#CC(N)=O, C[C@H]1O[C@H]1C#CC(=O)OCC(C)C, C#C[C@@H]1[C@H](C#N)C[C@@H]1C, C[C@@H]1C[C@]2(C[C@H]3O[C@H]32)C1, CO[C@@H]1CC[C@H]1C=O.

================================

 Based on the provided data, here are three rules that directly relate the structure/properties of a molecule to its Cv value:
1. Molecules with multiple carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C bonds) tend to have higher Cv values compared to molecules with single bonds or no double bonds. For example, C#CC#C[C@H]1COCO1 has a Cv value of 30.136999, while CO[C@@H]1C[C@H]2[C@@H]1C[C@H]2O has a Cv value of 28.115999. This rule can be explained by the fact that double bonds are more reactive and have a higher energy content than single bonds, which contributes to a higher Cv value.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher Cv values compared to molecules without aromatic rings. For example, C#C[C@@H]1NC(=O)NC1[NH-] has a Cv value of 29.899000, while C[C@H](N)C(=O)O has a Cv value of 30.761000. This rule can be explained by the fact that aromatic rings are more stable and have a higher energy content than single bonds, which contributes to a higher Cv value.
3. Molecules with amino groups tend to have lower Cv values compared to molecules without amino groups. For example, C#CC#C[C@H]1COCO1 has a Cv value of 30.136999, while C[C@H](N)C(=O)O has a Cv value of 30.761000. This rule can be explained by the fact that amino groups have a higher electronegativity than carbon-carbon single bonds, which makes them less reactive and contributes to a lower Cv value.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the Cv value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with multiple basic nitrogen atoms (e.g., guanidines, imidazoles, amino acids) tend to have higher Cv values. For example, O=C1NC[C@H]1[NH+]1CCC1 has a high Cv value of 31.018999 due to the presence of a guanidine group.
2. Molecules with conjugated systems or aromatic rings tend to have higher Cv values. For example, CC[C@@]12C[C@H]3C[C@@H](O1)[C@H]32 31.707001 has a high Cv value due to the presence of a double bond in the ring system.
3. Molecules with functional groups that can form multiple hydrogen bonds or have high dipolar moment tend to have higher Cv values. For example, CO[C@@H]1[C@H](C)[C@@H]1OC 33.812000 has a high Cv value due to the presence of a hydroxyl group that can form hydrogen bonds.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher number of double bonds and aromatic rings tend to have a higher Cv value.
Explanation: Double bonds and aromatic rings contribute to the stabilization of ions, which in turn affects the solvation energy and the Cv value. Molecules with a higher number of double bonds and aromatic rings have a more complex structure and therefore can form a more stable ion, leading to a higher Cv value.
Examples: Nc1c[nH]c([N+](=O)[O-])n1, CC[C@@]12N[C@]1(C)[C@H]1N[C@H]12
Rule 2: Molecules with a higher number of hydroxyl groups and amino groups tend to have a higher Cv value.
Explanation: Hydroxyl groups and amino groups are polar and can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, which increases the solvation energy and the Cv value. Molecules with a higher number of hydroxyl groups and amino groups have a more polar structure and can form a larger number of hydrogen bonds, leading to a higher Cv value.
Examples: C[C@@H](O)[C@@H](O)C#N, C[C@H]1[C@H]2C[C@@H]3[C@@H](O)[C@H]2[N@@H+]31
Rule 3: Molecules with a higher number of stereocenters tend to have a lower Cv value.
Explanation: Stereocenters create molecular asymmetry, which affects the interactions between molecules and the solvent. Molecules with a higher number of stereocenters have a more complex structure and therefore can interact in a more specific way with the solvent, leading to a lower Cv value.
Examples: CCO[C@H]1C[C@]1(CO)CN2, C[C@H]1[C@H]2C[C@@H]3[C@@H](O)[C@H]2[N@@H+]31

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Cv value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher Cv values than molecules without aromatic rings. For example, Cc1ccncn1 has a Cv value of 21.247999, while CC[C@@]1(C#N)OC[C@H]1C has a Cv value of 35.396999.
2. Molecules with amino groups tend to have lower Cv values than molecules without amino groups. For example, C[C@@H]1CC(=O)[C@H]2N[C@H]21 has a Cv value of 27.736000, while C#C[C@]12C[C@H]1N[C@H]2C#N has a Cv value of 30.455000.
3. Molecules with multiple bonds tend to have higher Cv values than molecules with fewer bonds. For example, CCO[C@@]1(CO)C[C@H]1O has a Cv value of 38.164001, while O[C@]12C=CC[C@H]1[C@H]1N[C@H]12 has a Cv value of 29.851000.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher Cv value tend to have a more complex structure, often with multiple rings or functional groups.
Rule 2: Molecules with a higher Cv value tend to have a more polar structure, as indicated by the presence of polar functional groups such as amines, carboxylic acids, and alcohols.
Rule 3: Molecules with a higher Cv value tend to have a more branched or unsaturated structure, as indicated by the presence of double or triple bonds and/or cyclic structures.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Cv (Kovats retention index) value:
1. Molecules with hydroxyl groups tend to have higher Cv values compared to molecules without them. This is because hydroxyl groups interact more strongly with the stationary phase in gas chromatography, leading to longer retention times and higher Cv values. Examples of such molecules include [O-][N@H]1[C@@H]2C[C@@H]2[C@@H]1CO and O[C@H]1CO[C@@H]2CC[C@H]1C2.
2. Molecules with polar functional groups, such as amines, carbonyls, and nitriles, tend to have lower Cv values compared to molecules without them. This is because these groups interact less strongly with the stationary phase, leading to shorter retention times and lower Cv values. Examples of such molecules include N-[(E)-1-oxo-1-(2-thienyl)propan-2-yl]propanamide and Cc1noc2c1CCC2.
3. Molecules with double bonds or aromatic rings tend to have higher Cv values compared to molecules without them. This is because these functional groups can interact more strongly with the stationary phase through pi-stacking or other interactions, leading to longer retention times and higher Cv values. Examples of such molecules include c1n[nH]c2c1N1C[C@@H]1C2 and O=C1COC[C@@]12CN1CC[C@H]1[C@H]2[C@@H]1OC.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Cv value:
1. Molecules with multiple ring systems or aromaticity tend to have a higher Cv value. This can be seen in molecules such as "c1cc2ccoc2cn1", "C#C[C@H](O)[C@@H]1O[C@@H]1CC", and "O=Cn1ccc(O)n1". The presence of double or triple bonds, aromatic rings, and/or extensive conjugation can increase the complexity of a molecule, resulting in a higher Cv value.
2. Molecules with amino groups or basic functionalities tend to have a lower Cv value. This can be observed in molecules such as "C#CC[C@H](CCO)OC", "CCc1cn[nH]c(=O)c1", and "CCc1nccc(N)n1". These molecules have amino or basic groups that can undergo acid-base reactions, which can lower the energy required for bond breaking and thus result in a lower Cv value.
3. Molecules with bulky or complex substituents tend to have a higher Cv value. This can be seen in molecules such as "C[C@@H]1[C@]2(O)CC[C@]12O", "N#CCNC(=N)C#N", and "C[C@H]1C=C[C@@]23CC[C@@]12N3". These molecules have large or complex substituents that can increase the steric hindrance around the reactive site, making it more difficult to break bonds and thus increasing the Cv value.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Cv value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher Cv values than molecules without aromatic rings. This can be attributed to the presence of delocalized pi-electrons in aromatic rings, which increases the molecular complexity and stability. For example, C#CCCCC(=O)C#C has a high Cv value of 35.661999 due to the presence of two aromatic rings.
2. Molecules with amino groups tend to have lower Cv values than molecules without amino groups. This is because amino groups introduce more negative charge into the molecule, which decreases the overall stability and complexities. For example, CC[C@@]1(CO)O[C@H]1CCO has a Cv value of 38.118000 due to the presence of amino groups.
3. Molecules with multiple stereocenters tend to have higher Cv values than molecules with fewer stereocenters. This is because molecules with multiple stereocenters have more possible arrangements of their atoms, leading to increased structural complexity. For example, C#CC[C@H](O)[C@@H](C)O has a Cv value of 40.376999 due to the presence of two stereocenters.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Cv value:
1. Molecules with multiple basic amino groups or guanidinium ions tend to have higher Cv values due to their increased protonation at lower pH. For example, NC1=[NH2+])[C@H]2N[CH+]NC2=O and NC[C@@H]1N.
2. Molecules with unsaturated bonds or aromatic systems tend to have lower Cv values due to their delocalized pi-electrons and increased stability. For example, c1ccncc1 and c1ccco1.
3. Molecules with bulky or complex structures tend to have higher Cv values due to their increased surface area and increased potential for interactions. For example, CCOC[C@H]1C[C@@H](C)C1 and C[C@@]12C[C@@H]3C(=O)N1[C@@H]1CC[C@@]2(C=O)O3.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the Cv (Chemical Valence) value of a molecule based on its structure and properties:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher Cv values than molecules without aromatic rings. For example, molecules like N#C[C@@H]1[C@@H]2CC[C@@]1(O)C2 and C#C[C@](C)(CC)OCC have high Cv values due to the presence of aromatic rings, while molecules like CC1(OC(=O)CO)CC1 and CCCOC(C)(C)C=O have lower Cv values as they do not contain aromatic rings.
2. Molecules with amino groups tend to have lower Cv values than molecules without amino groups. For example, molecules like Cc1nc(C)nc(N)n1 and O=c1cnc(F)c(O)o1 have low Cv values as they contain amino groups, while molecules like C#C[C@@]1(O)CC[C@@H]1NO and CO[C@@H]1C(=O)[C@@H]2[C@H]1[N@@H+]2C have high Cv values as they do not contain amino groups.
3. Molecules with unsaturated bonds tend to have higher Cv values than molecules with saturated bonds. For example, molecules like C#CCc1occc1N and C[C@@H]1OC(C)(C)[C@H]1N have high Cv values due to the presence of unsaturated bonds, while molecules like CC1O[C@]23C[C@H]([C@H]4C[C@H]42)[C@@H]13 and CO[C@@H]1C(=O)[C@@H]2[C@H]1[N@@H+]2C have low Cv values as they have saturated bonds.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the data:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds, such as double or triple bonds, tend to have a higher Cv value. This is evidenced by molecules such as COC[C@@H](C)OC=O, C[C@H]1C[C@]23C[C@@]2(CO3)O1, C#CCC[C@H](C)[C@@H](C)O, and C#C/C(=N/O)C1(C)CC1, which all contain multiple bonds and have high Cv values.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have a higher Cv value. This is evidenced by molecules such as CO[C@]12CC[C@H]1[C@H]1O[C@H]12, Cc1nonc1[N+](=O)[O-], and C[C@@H]1CO[C@H]2[C@@H](O)[C@H]21, which all contain aromatic rings and have high Cv values.
3. Molecules with heteroatoms, such as nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur, tend to have a higher Cv value. This is evidenced by molecules such as N#C[C@H]1C[NH+]2CC=C[C@@H]12, O=C1N2[C@@H]3C=C[C@@]1(O)[C@@H]32, and C[C@@]12COC[C@@H]1[C@H]1O[C@@H]12, which all contain heteroatoms and have high Cv values.

================================
