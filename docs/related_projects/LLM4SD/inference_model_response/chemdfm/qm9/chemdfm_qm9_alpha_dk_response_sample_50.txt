 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the alpha value:
1. The presence of a positively charged nitrogen in a molecule generally indicates a high alpha value, as seen in molecules such as [NH-][C@H]1COC2(CC2)CO1, C[NH+]1CC1, and C1[C@@H]2CO[C@@H](C2)[C@@H](O)C1.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings or unsaturated bonds tend to have higher alpha values, as these structural features can increase the molecular complexity and thus the alpha value. For example, molecules like C#C[C@H](C=O)OC=O, C#CC[C@@]1(C)C[C@@H]1OC, and C[C@@H]1C=CC2(CC2)[C@@H]1O2.
3. Molecules with complex ring systems or multiple stereocenters tend to have higher alpha values, as these structural features can increase the molecular complexity and thus the alpha value. For instance, C1C[C@]23C[N@H+]2CC[C@@H]3O1, C1[C@@H]2C[C@H]([NH+]3CC3)[C@@H]1O2, and C[C@@H]1C=CC2(CC2)[C@@H]1O2.
It is important to note that alpha value is a relative measure and can vary depending on the reference compound used for the calibration. Therefore, the above rules should be considered as general guidelines and may not always hold true for all molecules.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the structures/properties of a molecule to its alpha value:
1. Molecules with multiple rings or complex structures tend to have higher alpha values.
2. Molecules with functional groups involving heteroatoms (e.g., N, O, S) tend to have higher alpha values.
3. Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g., C=C, C#N) or aromatic systems tend to have higher alpha values.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the alpha value of a molecule based on its structure or properties:
1. Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g., C#C, C=O, C=C) tend to have higher alpha values. This is evident in the examples such as C#C[C@@H]1OCC=C[C@@H]1O, CC#CC#N, and C#CC(=O)NCCC=O.
2. Molecules with heteroatoms like oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur tend to have higher alpha values. For example, Cn1cc(CC#N)cn1, Nc1nc2nc[nH]c2o1, and O=COc1ccncn1 all contain these elements and have high alpha values.
3. Molecules with positive charges or protonated nitrogens tend to have higher alpha values. This is evident in the examples such as [NH-]C1COC(=O)CN1, Nc1cnc(CO)nc1, and C[NH2+]C1C=C(N)CO1.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the alpha value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher alpha values. This can be seen in molecules like C#C[C@H]1C[C@@H]2[C@H](O)[C@@H]2C1, C#C[C@@H]1C[C@]1(C#N), and C1=C[C@@H]2CN2C1=O, which all contain aromatic rings and have relatively high alpha values.
2. Molecules with multiple bonds between non-carbon atoms tend to have lower alpha values. For example, N#C[C@@H]1[C@H](O)[C@@H]1C1CC1 has a single bond between the nitrogen and carbon atoms, while C#C[C@@H]1C[C@]1(C#N) has a triple bond between the same atoms. The molecule with the triple bond has a lower alpha value.
3. Molecules with more complex structures tend to have higher alpha values. This can be seen in molecules like C#C[C@H]1C[C@@H]2[C@H](O)[C@@H]2C1 and C1=C[C@@H]2CN2C1=O, which both have multiple bonds and aromatic rings but also have more complex structures. They have relatively high alpha values compared to molecules with simpler structures like CO[C@H]1C[C@H]2C=C[C@@H]1O2 or CC[C@]1(O)CC=CCC1.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the structure/property of a molecule to its alpha value:
1. The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms in a molecule generally increases its alpha value. This is because nitrogen has a high electronegativity, which attracts electrons towards itself and creates a partial negative charge on the molecule.
2. The presence of multiple carbonyl groups in a molecule can also increase its alpha value. This is because a carbonyl group is an electron-withdrawing group, which can make the surrounding atoms more positive and increase the overall positive charge of the molecule.
3. The presence of multiple functional groups that are known to be positively charged, such as guanidinium or ammonium ions, can also increase the alpha value of a molecule. This is because these groups will contribute additional positive charge to the molecule, making it more positively charged overall.

================================

 1. Molecules with a high alpha value tend to have aromatic rings or unsaturated bonds, which can increase the molecular weight and therefore increase the alpha value.
2. Molecules with functional groups that can form multiple bonds, such as carbonyls, amines, and alcohols, tend to have a higher alpha value due to increased molecular complexity.
3. Molecules with a high number of heavy atoms, such as nitrogen and oxygen, tend to have a higher alpha value due to increased molecular weight.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the alpha value:
1. The alpha value is likely to be high for molecules with multiple rings, as seen in many of the examples given (e.g., C[C@@H]1C[C@]2(O1)[C@@H]1C[C@H]2C1). This is because molecules with multiple rings tend to have more complex and rigid structures, which can make it difficult for the molecule to enter a solution.
2. The alpha value is likely to be high for molecules with unsaturated bonds, such as double or triple bonds, as seen in many of the examples given (e.g., C#C[C@H](O)c1cnon1). This is because unsaturated bonds can create a more compact and rigid structure, making it difficult for the molecule to enter a solution.
3. The alpha value is likely to be high for molecules with aromatic rings, as seen in many of the examples given (e.g., C[C@@H]1C[C@]2(O1)[C@@H]1C[C@H]2C1). This is because aromatic rings tend to be planar and rigid, which can make it difficult for the molecule to enter a solution.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the alpha value of a molecule based on its structure and properties:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings or multiple double bonds tend to have higher alpha values. This can be seen in molecules such as C#C[C@]12C[C@H]1OCO2, C#C[C@@H]1COC1[NH-], and CC#CC12C[NH+]3CCC[C@@H]1C[C@H]23, which all have high alpha values.
2. Molecules with hydroxyl groups or amino groups tend to have lower alpha values. For example, CC(C)(CC=O)OC=O has a low alpha value compared to C#C[C@@H]1COC1[NH-]. This is because the hydroxyl group in CC(C)(CC=O)OC=O is able to donate electrons, which decreases the overall positive charge of the molecule and thus its alpha value.
3. Molecules with charged groups or species tend to have higher alpha values. This can be seen in molecules such as N#C[C@@]12C[C@H]3C[N@@H+]3[C@@H]12, C[C@@H]1/C=C\CCOCO1, and OCC[C@@]12[C@@H]3[C@H]4[C@@H]3[C@@H]1[C@H]42, which all have high alpha values due to the presence of charged groups or species.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the alpha value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher alpha values. For example, molecules like CCC(=O)c1ccco1 and C[C@@H]1C=Cc2ccoc21 have high alpha values. This is because the aromaticity of the ring increases the stability of the molecule, resulting in a higher alpha value.
2. Molecules with heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine tend to have higher alpha values. For example, molecules like Oc1cnc2n1CCO2, C[C@@H]1CO[C@@H]1C, and C[C@@H]1[C@H](CCO)O[C@@H]1C have high alpha values due to the presence of these heteroatoms. The presence of heteroatoms increases the polarity of the molecule, which results in increased stability and a higher alpha value.
3. Molecules with unsaturated bonds tend to have lower alpha values. For example, molecules like CCC(=O)c1ccco1 and Cc1ncc(O)nc1F have high alpha values, while molecules like CO[C@H]1CC=CC[C@H]2C[C@H]21 and O=CCCc1cn[nH]nn1 have lower alpha values. This is because unsaturated bonds are more reactive and less stable than saturated bonds, resulting in lower stability and a lower alpha value.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the alpha value:
1. The presence of a double bond between a nitrogen atom and a carbon atom significantly increases the alpha value. For example, Nc1[nH]nc2c1CCN2 and C#C[C@@H](C1CC1)[NH+]1CC1 have alpha values of 76.099998 and 85.459999, respectively. This is because the double bond between the nitrogen and carbon atoms creates a highly positively charged nitrogen atom, which leads to a higher alpha value.
2. The presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom increases the alpha value. For example, CC[N@H+]1[C@H]2[C@H]3C[C@@H]1[C@]32C has an alpha value of 86.820000, while N#CC1(CC#N)CN1 has an alpha value of 72.309998. This is because the positively charged nitrogen atom attracts electrons more strongly, resulting in a higher alpha value.
3. The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) or a related group (e.g., CO) increases the alpha value. For example, CO[C@@H]1C=CCOC1 and CC(C)=O both have alpha values of 70.599998, while O=C1C=C2[C@@H](C1)[N@H+]1C[C@@H]21 has an alpha value of 76.209999. This is because the carbonyl group or related group attracts electrons more strongly, leading to a higher alpha value.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the alpha value:
1. The presence of a tertiary amino group in a molecule increases its alpha value. This is evident in the case of O=C1CO[C@H]2C[N@@H+](C1)C2 which has an alpha value of 71.070000 and CO[C@H]1CC[C@@]2(C)N[C@@H]12 which has an alpha value of 82.919998. Both molecules have tertiary amino groups.
2. The presence of a carboxyl group or a similar functional group in a molecule decreases its alpha value. This is evident in the case of CCn1c(C)n[nH]c1=O which has an alpha value of 73.660004 and C#C[C@@]12C[CH-][C@H]3C[C@@H]1[C@H]32 which has an alpha value of 86.800003. Both molecules contain carboxyl groups.
3. The presence of an aromatic ring in a molecule increases its alpha value. This is evident in the case of Cc1ccc[nH]c1=O which has an alpha value of 76.339996 and C[C@@H]1OC[C@H]2OC[C@H]2O1 which has an alpha value of 71.610001. Both molecules contain aromatic rings.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the alpha value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with a positive alpha value generally have an even number of electrons, while molecules with a negative alpha value generally have an odd number of electrons. This is because the alpha particle is composed of two protons and two neutrons, which gives it an overall positive charge. Therefore, molecules that can accept two electrons to become stable (i.e., have an even number of electrons) will have a positive alpha value, while molecules that need to donate two electrons to become stable (i.e., have an odd number of electrons) will have a negative alpha value.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have a positive alpha value, while molecules without these features tend to have a negative alpha value. This is because aromatic rings and double bonds are electron-rich structures that can easily accept two electrons to become stable, giving the molecule a positive alpha value. Conversely, molecules without these features often have electron-deficient double bonds or aromatic rings, which makes it more difficult for them to accept two electrons, giving them a negative alpha value.
3. Molecules with positively charged amino groups or nitrogen atoms tend to have a positive alpha value, while molecules with negatively charged carboxyl groups or oxygen atoms tend to have a negative alpha value. This is because positively charged amino groups and nitrogen atoms can easily accept two electrons to become stable, giving the molecule a positive alpha value. Conversely, negatively charged carboxyl groups and oxygen atoms can easily donate two electrons to become stable, giving the molecule a negative alpha value.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the alpha value of a molecule based on its structure/properties:
1. Molecules with multiple rings and/or aromatic systems tend to have higher alpha values. For example, molecules like CO[C@H]1C=C(C)[C@H]2O[C@@H]12 and N#C[C@H](C=O)CC=O have low alpha values, while molecules like Nc1oc(CO)cc1O and C#CCNc1[nH]cn[nH+]1 have high alpha values. This suggests that the presence of multiple rings and/or aromatic systems can increase the alpha value of a molecule.
2. Molecules with basic functional groups or molecules that can form negative ions tend to have lower alpha values. For example, molecules like CO[C@@H]1C=CC[C@@H](C=O)O1 and C[N@@H+]1C[C@H]1[C@@H](O)C#N have high alpha values, while molecules like C[NH2+]C1C[C@@H](C)[C@@H](C)O1 and OCCCC1=NCCO1 have low alpha values. This suggests that the presence of basic functional groups or molecules that can form negative ions can decrease the alpha value of a molecule.
3. Molecules with more complex and/or bulky structures tend to have lower alpha values. For example, molecules like C[C@@H]1C[C@H]2N[C@H]3[C@@H]1[C@@]23O and C[N@H+]1C[C@H]2N[C@H]3[C@@H]1[C@@]23O have low alpha values, while molecules like N#C[C@@H]1[C@@H]2O[C@H]1C[C@@H]2O and C[C@@H]1C=CC[C@@H](C=O)O1 have high alpha values. This suggests that the complexity and bulky nature of a molecule can decrease its alpha value.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the alpha value of a molecule based on its structure/properties:
1. Molecules with a ring structure and at least one unsaturated bond (e.g., C#C, C#CC) tend to have higher alpha values than molecules without such features. This is because the unsaturated bonds provide more potential energy for the molecule to release during detonation. For example, many of the high alpha value molecules in the data set (e.g., N#Cc1cncnc1F, C#CC(C#C)[C@@H](C)C=O) have ring structures with unsaturated bonds.
2. Molecules with an aromatic amine group (e.g., NH2) tend to have lower alpha values than molecules without such groups. This is because the aromatic amine group deactivates the molecule by delocalizing the nitrogen lone pairs, which reduces the reactivity of the molecule during detonation. For example, N#Cc1cncnc1F has a higher alpha value than N#Cc1cncnc1NH2, which has an additional aromatic amine group.
3. Molecules with an aromatic ketone or aldehyde group (e.g., C(=O)c1ccccc1) tend to have lower alpha values than molecules without such groups. This is because the aromatic ketone or aldehyde group increases the molecular weight of the compound, which decreases its potential energy release during detonation. Additionally, the aromatic ketone or aldehyde group can also deactivate the molecule by delocalizing the carbonyl group's electrons, reducing the reactivity of the molecule during detonation. For example, C#CC(C#C)[C@@H](C)C=O has a higher alpha value than C#CC(C#C)[C@@H](C)C(=O), which has an aromatic ketone group instead of an olefinic double bond.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a high alpha value tend to have aromatic rings, double bonds, or triple bonds.
Rule 2: Molecules with a low alpha value tend to be open-chain compounds or cyclic compounds without aromatic rings, double bonds, or triple bonds.
Rule 3: Molecules with a high alpha value tend to have a more complex structure with multiple functional groups, while molecules with a low alpha value tend to have a simpler structure with fewer functional groups.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher number of double bonds and aromatic rings tend to have a higher alpha value.
Explanation: Double bonds and aromatic rings can contribute to the stability of the cationic species formed during the alpha value determination, leading to a higher alpha value.
Examples: CC#C[C@@H](CO)C(C)C (90.709999), Cc1ccc(O)cc1O (79.900002)
Rule 2: Molecules with a higher number of amino groups tend to have a lower alpha value.
Explanation: Amino groups can donate protons, leading to the formation of negative species during the alpha value determination, resulting in a lower alpha value.
Examples: C[C@@H]1O[C@]12[C@@H]1C34OC13[C@H]42 (72.019997), N#CC[C@H]1N[C@H]1[C@H]1CN1 (76.580002)
Rule 3: Molecules with a higher number of stereocenters tend to have a lower alpha value.
Explanation: Stereocenters can introduce chiral centers, leading to the formation of multiple species during the alpha value determination, resulting in a lower alpha value.
Examples: CC(=O)N1[CH+][NH2+][C@H]2C[C@H]21 (75.639999), C[C@@]12C[C@@](C=O)(O1)C2=O (69.489998)

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the alpha value of a molecule based on its structure/properties:
1. Molecules with a hydroxyl group attached to a carbon with an sp2 or sp3 hybridization close to the carbon backbone tend to have a higher alpha value. For example, molecules like Cc1ncc([C@@H](C)O)[nH]1 (alpha value = 79.360001), CC1=C[C@@H](O)C[C@H]1C#N (alpha value = 77.989998), and CCOC(=O)NC(N)=O (alpha value = 68.250000) have high alpha values.
2. Molecules with a cyclic structure or an aromatic ring tend to have a lower alpha value. For example, molecules like O=C1C=C(C2CC2)CN1 (alpha value = 81.730003) and N#CC[C@H]1C[C@H]2CC[C@H]21 (alpha value = 82.760002) have lower alpha values compared to molecules with open-chain structures.
3. Molecules with a positively charged nitrogen atom or a positively charged nitrogen moiety tend to have a higher alpha value. For example, molecules like C[NH+]1C[C@@]12COCC2=O (alpha value = 73.750000) and N#C[C@H]1C=C[C@@H]2C[C@H]21 (alpha value = 81.050003) have high alpha values due to the presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom or nitrogen moiety.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the alpha value:
1. Molecules with aromatic or heteroaromatic rings tend to have higher alpha values than molecules without such rings. For example, C#Cc1cncc(N)c1 and Cn1c(=O)cnoc1=O have alpha values of 89.720001 and 61.990002, respectively.
2. Molecules with amino groups or basic functionalities tend to have higher alpha values than molecules without such groups. For example, N#C[C@H]1C[C@]23C[C@H](C2)C13 and CO[C@]12CC=C[C@H](C1)C2 have alpha values of 82.040001 and 82.730003, respectively.
3. Molecules with multiple chiral centers or complex ring systems tend to have higher alpha values than molecules with fewer chiral centers or simpler ring systems. For example, C#CC1(C#CC)CCC1 and O=C1[C@H]2O[C@H]3[C@@H]1C[C@H]3O2 have alpha values of 91.370003 and 62.980000, respectively.

================================

 Based on the given data, we can infer the following three rules that directly relate the structure and properties of a molecule to its alpha value:
1. Molecules with multiple rings or complex structures tend to have higher alpha values. For example, C[C@H]1OCC(C)(C)[C@H]1C (alpha = 87.18) has a simple structure but still has a high alpha value. On the other hand, C1=Cc2[nH]nnc2CC1 (alpha = 78.11) has a more complex structure with two rings but still has a relatively low alpha value.
2. Molecules with functional groups that are known to be reactive or polar tend to have higher alpha values. For example, C#CCO[C@@H](C)CO (alpha = 76.72) contains a hydroxyl group, which is known to be reactive and polar. Similarly, N#CC(=O)OC1COC1 (alpha = 64.11) contains a carboxylic acid group, which is also known to be reactive and polar.
3. Molecules with multiple charged species tend to have higher alpha values. For example, C[N@@H+]1C[C@@H](NO)[C@H]1C=O (alpha = 75.05) contains both a protonated amino group and a protonated hydroxyl group, which contributes to its overall positive charge and higher alpha value. Similarly, C#CCC(=O)N/C=N/C (alpha = 82.40) contains a protonated imine group and a positively charged nitrogen atom, which contributes to its overall positive charge and higher alpha value.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the structure/property of a molecule to its alpha value:
1. The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a molecule is positively correlated with a high alpha value. Many of the molecules with high alpha values have a C=O group in their structure, such as N#C[C@@H]1C[C@@H]1CCCO, CC1=C(C)[C@@H]2CN2C1=O, and C[N@@H+]1CC(=O)C[C@H](O)C1.
2. The presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom in a molecule is positively correlated with a high alpha value. Many of the molecules with high alpha values have a positively charged nitrogen atom in their structure, such as C[N@H+]1C[C@@]2(C)[C@@H](C=O)[C@@H]12, C[C@H]1OC[C@]1(C)C=O, and C#CCCC#C[C@@H]1C[N@@H+]1C.
3. The molecular weight of a molecule is negatively correlated with a high alpha value. Many of the molecules with low alpha values have a higher molecular weight, while those with high alpha values tend to have a lower molecular weight. For example, O[C@H]1[C@H]2C[C@H]3CC[C@H]3[C@@H]12 has a molecular weight of 80.27, while N#C[C@@H]1C[C@@H]1CCCO has a molecular weight of 79.73.

================================

 Here are three possible rules that directly relate the structure and properties of a molecule to its alpha value:
1. The presence of multiple rings in a molecule seems to increase its alpha value. For example, molecules like C1=Cn2ccnc2OC1, CCOC[C@H]1CC1(C)C, and C#CC[C@H](CC)OC have high alpha values due to their ringed structures.
2. Molecules with positively charged nitrogen atoms tend to have higher alpha values. For example, many molecules like N#C[C@@]12COC(=O)[C@@H]1N2, N#CC#Cc1cocn1, and [NH-][CH+]Oc1ccc[nH]1 have high alpha values due to the presence of protonated nitrogen atoms.
3. Molecules with conjugated double bonds or aromatic systems also tend to have higher alpha values. For example, molecules like C#C[C@]12COC[C@@H]1OC2, O=C1CNC(=O)[C@@]12CO2, and c1n[nH]c2c1[C@@H]1N[C@@H]1C2 have high alpha values due to the presence of conjugated double bonds or aromatic systems.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the alpha value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with aromatic amines tend to have a high alpha value. For example, Cc1cc(C)cc(N)c1 has an alpha value of 92.820000. This can be attributed to the presence of a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom which increases the electron density in the molecule, making it more reactive.
2. Molecules with multiple ring systems tend to have a higher alpha value. For example, CC1=C[C@@H]2O[C@@H]2[C@@H]1C has an alpha value of 81.080002. The presence of multiple rings increases the complexity of the molecule, which in turn increases the reactivity and alpha value.
3. Molecules with positively charged ions tend to have a higher alpha value. For example, N#C[C@@H]1[C@@H]2[C@@H]3C[C@@H]3[C@@]21O has an alpha value of 81.760002. The presence of positively charged ions in a molecule indicates the presence of reactive functional groups, such as amino groups or carboxyl groups, which increase the reactivity and alpha value of the molecule.

================================

 Based on the given data, we can infer three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the alpha value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have higher alpha values than those without. For example, C#C[C@@H]1CC12CC=CC2 has an alpha value of 87.419998, while C#C[C@H]1[C@@H](C#N)[C@H]1CO has an alpha value of 75.279999. This is because aromatic rings and double bonds are more stable and thus require more energy to break.
2. Molecules with amino groups or positive charges tend to have higher alpha values than those without. For example, N#C[C@@H]1OCC[C@@H]1CO has an alpha value of 70.650002, while C[C@@H]1OC(=O)[C@]1(N)CO has an alpha value of 54.180000. This is because amino groups and positive charges are more reactive and thus require more energy to stabilize.
3. Molecules with tertiary amino groups or quaternary ammonium ions tend to have lower alpha values than those without. For example, C[C@@H]1OC(=O)[C@]1(N)CO has an alpha value of 54.180000, while C[C@H](C#N)C[C@H]1O[C@H]1C has an alpha value of 80.220001. This is because tertiary amino groups and quaternary ammonium ions are less reactive and thus require less energy to stabilize.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the alpha value:
1. Molecules with multiple rings or complex structures tend to have higher alpha values, as they have more atoms and therefore more potential for nonpolar interactions with the solvent. For example, C[C@@]12CC(=O)[C@@H](N1)[C@H]2O, with its two rings, has an alpha value of 72.17, while N#Cc1nocnc1=O, with its simple linear structure, has an alpha value of 61.77.
2. Molecules with unsaturated bonds, such as double or triple bonds, tend to have lower alpha values, as these bonds are more polar and can form stronger dipolar interactions with the solvent. For example, CC#CC#C[C@H]1CCO1 has an alpha value of 98.98, while C[C@@]12CC(=O)[C@@H](N1)[C@H]2O has an alpha value of 72.17, even though both molecules have similar overall sizes and complexity.
3. Molecules with charged or polar functional groups tend to have higher alpha values, as these groups can form strong dipolar interactions with the solvent. For example, C[N@@H+]1CC(=O)C12CCC2 has an alpha value of 80.17, while N#CCC/N=C(\N)C=O has an alpha value of 75.61. This is because the positively charged amino group in the first molecule can form strong dipolar interactions with the solvent, while the negatively charged group in the second molecule can repel the solvent and decrease its solubility.

================================

 1. Molecules with an alpha value greater than 80 are often organic compounds with multiple ring systems and/or aromatic character. They tend to have more complex structures and are generally more challenging to synthesize.
2. Molecules with an alpha value less than 60 are often small molecules or ions with relatively simple structures. They tend to have lower boiling points and are generally less challenging to synthesize.
3. Molecules with an alpha value between 60 and 80 are often organic compounds with one or two ring systems and/or non-aromatic character. They tend to have moderate complexity and can be challenging to synthesize if they have unusual functional groups or stereochemistry.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the alpha value of a molecule based on its structure/properties:
1. Molecules with a carbonyl group (C=O or C=C(O)C=O) tend to have higher alpha values. For example, N#CC1(CC=O)CNC1 has an alpha value of 72.949997, while C#C[C@@]1(O)C(=O)C[C@@H]1O has an alpha value of 68.750000.
2. Molecules with a positive charge on a nitrogen atom tend to have higher alpha values. This is evident in the set of data, where many of the molecules with positive alpha values contain nitrogen atoms with a positive charge, such as [CH-]1[C@@H]2C[C@H]3[C@@H]2[N@H+]2[C@@H]1C[C@@H]32 and N#C[C@H]1NC[C@H]1[C@H]1CO1.
3. Molecules with an sp2 hybridized carbon atom tend to have higher alpha values. This is evident in the set of data, where many of the molecules with high alpha values contain double or triple bonds, such as Cc1nc(=O)cnn1C and C#CC#CC1=CCCC1 107.910004.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the structure/property of a molecule to its alpha value:
1. Molecules with an aromatic ring or a double bond between a nitrogen and a carbon atom tend to have a higher alpha value. For example, C#CCOC(=O)COC has an alpha value of 73.339996, while [CH+]1[NH2+][C@@]23C[C@H](C[C@@H]2C3)O1 has an alpha value of 74.489998. This is because the aromaticity of the ring or the pi-electrons in the double bond increase the molecular stability, resulting in a higher alpha value.
2. Molecules with an sp3 hybridized carbon atom with an oxygen or nitrogen atom tend to have a lower alpha value. For example, O=C[C@@]12CC[C@H](O)[C@@H]1N2 has an alpha value of 73.260002, while C[C@@]12OC[C@@H](O)[C@@H]1[C@@H]2O has an alpha value of 70.940002. This is because the sigma bonding in the sp3 hybridization decreases the stability of the molecule, resulting in a lower alpha value.
3. Molecules with a charged group or a highly polar functional group tend to have a higher alpha value. For example, C[NH-]1CC[C@@H]2C(=O)OC[C@H]21 has an alpha value of 76.459999, while Nc1cc2n(n1)C=CC2 has an alpha value of 80.599998. This is because the charged or polar group creates an electrostatic interaction within the molecule, increasing the stability and resulting in a higher alpha value.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the structures and properties of a molecule to its alpha value:
1. Molecules with multiple heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, and/or fluorine) tend to have higher alpha values compared to molecules without these atoms. This is because these atoms have high electronegativities, which can cause the molecule to become more positively charged and thus increase its alpha value. For example, C#Cc1oncc1C and N#CC1([C@@H]2CO2)CC1 both contain multiple heteroatoms and have relatively high alpha values.
2. Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g., double or triple bonds) tend to have lower alpha values compared to molecules with saturated bonds. This is because unsaturated bonds have a higher tendency to donate electrons and thus make the molecule more negative, leading to a lower alpha value. For example, CC#Cc1ccn(C)c1 contains unsaturated bonds and has a relatively low alpha value.
3. Molecules with positive charges tend to have higher alpha values compared to neutral molecules, while molecules with negative charges tend to have lower alpha values compared to neutral molecules. This is because charged molecules have an excess of electric charge, which can cause the molecule to become more positively or negatively charged and thus increase or decrease its alpha value, respectively. For example, C[NH+]1C=O[C@@H]2C[C@H]1OC22 contains a positively charged nitrogen atom and has a relatively high alpha value, while [NH-]c1[nH]ccc1O contains a negatively charged nitrogen atom and has a relatively low alpha value.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the alpha value:
1. Molecules with multiple rings or complex ring systems tend to have higher alpha values. For example, C[C@H]1[C@H]2CO[C@H]2C[C@H]1O, C1=C[C@]23C[C@H]2CO[@@H]3C1, and C[C@@H]1C[C@@H]2CO[C@@H]2N1 have alpha values of 76.620003, 80.540001, and 73.129997, respectively. This is because such molecules often contain multiple bonds, aromaticity, or delocalized pi-electron systems, which contribute to their overall stability and hence their alpha values.
2. Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g., double or triple bonds) tend to have lower alpha values compared to their saturated counterparts. For example, C#C[C@]12CO[C@H](C1)C2 and C#C[C@@H](O)CC#CC#N have alpha values of 70.809998 and 83.480003, respectively. This is because unsaturated bonds are less stable than saturated bonds, and thus the molecules containing them are less resistant to degradation.
3. Molecules with polar functional groups tend to have higher alpha values compared to their nonpolar counterparts. For example, CC(=O)Oc1ccoc1 and O=C1C[C@H]2CC[C@H]2N1 have alpha values of 69.070000 and 67.949997, respectively. This is because polar functional groups can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, which enhances the solubility and stability of the molecule, leading to a higher alpha value.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the alpha value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have higher alpha values than molecules without them. This is because such molecules have more complex and stable structures that require more energy to break apart. For example, many of the molecules with high alpha values in the given data set, such as C#C[C@@]12C[C@H]3C[C@@H]1[C@]32O and C[C@@]12OC[C@H]3C[C@@H]1[C@]32O, contain aromatic rings or double bonds.
2. Molecules with amino groups tend to have lower alpha values than molecules without them. This is because amino groups can act as electron donors, which can stabilize the molecule and reduce the amount of energy required to break apart the molecule. For example, many of the molecules with low alpha values in the given data set, such as C[C@@H]1O[C@H](C)[C@@H]1O and C[C@]12C[C@@H]3[C@H]1OCO[C@@H]32, contain amino groups.
3. Molecules with carbonyl groups or acidic protons tend to have higher alpha values than molecules without them. This is because carbonyl groups and acidic protons can donate hydrogen atoms, which can make the molecule less stable and require more energy to break apart. For example, many of the molecules with high alpha values in the given data set, such as CC#CC(C=O)C=O and O=CC(=O)C1NCC[NH2+]1, contain carbonyl groups or acidic protons.

================================

 1. The alpha value is related to the presence of basic functional groups such as amino groups, guanidine groups, and imidazole groups, which can donate a proton and become positively charged. Molecules with these groups tend to have higher alpha values.
2. The alpha value is also related to the presence of acidic functional groups such as carboxy groups, alcohols, and phenols, which can accept a proton and become negatively charged. Molecules with these groups tend to have lower alpha values.
3. The alpha value is also influenced by the overall structure and polarity of the molecule. Polar molecules with a symmetrical distribution of charge tend to have higher alpha values, while nonpolar molecules with an uneven distribution of charge tend to have lower alpha values.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, I can infer three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the alpha value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have higher alpha values than molecules without them. This is because the delocalized pi-electrons in such molecules can contribute to a more extensive conjugation, leading to increased stability and higher alpha values.
2. Molecules with amino groups or nitro compounds tend to have lower alpha values than molecules without them. This is because such molecules have an electron-rich environment, which decreases the overall stability of the molecule and leads to a lower alpha value.
3. Molecules with bulky or complex structures tend to have lower alpha values than molecules with simpler structures. This is because the increased complexity and steric hindrance in such molecules can lead to decreased stability and lower alpha values.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the alpha value of a molecule based on its structure/properties:
1. Molecules with multiple rings and/or aromatic systems tend to have higher alpha values. For example, many of the molecules with high alpha values (e.g., C#Cc1cc(C#N)on1, C#C[C@H]1[C@@H]2CO[C@]12C=O) have multiple rings and/or aromatic systems.
2. Molecules with positively charged species (e.g., [NH2+], [CH+], [NH-]) tend to have higher alpha values. This is likely because such species can interact more strongly with the test organism and cause a greater change in pH.
3. Molecules with certain functional groups (e.g., amines, acetamides, alcohols) tend to have lower alpha values. This is likely because such molecules are less reactive and therefore have a smaller impact on the pH of the surrounding environment.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the alpha value of a molecule:
1. The presence of an alpha-amino acid or derivative thereof seems to increase the alpha value of a molecule. For example, molecules like C[C@H]1C[C@H]2OC(=O)C[C@@H]12, O[C@H]1C[C

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the alpha value of a molecule based on its structure and properties:
1. Molecules with a formal charge imbalance (e.g., positively charged nitrogens, negatively charged oxygens, and protonated amino groups) tend to have higher alpha values. For example, many of the molecules with alpha values above 80 have positively charged nitrogens or protonated amino groups. This rule could be used to predict the alpha value of a molecule based on the presence and location of these charges.
2. Molecules with unsaturated bonds tend to have lower alpha values. For example, many of the molecules with alpha values below 70 are unsaturated hydrocarbons or heterocycles. This rule could be used to predict the alpha value of a molecule based on its bonding pattern and unsaturation count.
3. Molecules with complex structures or multiple functional groups tend to have higher alpha values. For example, many of the molecules with alpha values above 80 have multiple functional groups or complex ring systems. This rule could be used to predict the alpha value of a molecule based on its structural complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the structure/property of a molecule to its alpha value:
1. Molecules with multiple heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, and/or sulfur) tend to have higher alpha values compared to molecules with fewer or no heteroatoms. For example, the molecule "O=C1C=CC2(CCC2)C1" has an alpha value of 82.93, while the molecule "CC(=O)[C@H](C)C1(C)CC1" has an alpha value of 85.55. The former contains two double bonds and two rings, while the latter is a simple ketone.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher alpha values compared to molecules without aromatic rings. For example, the molecule "C#CC[C@H]1C[C@H](C#N)O1" has an alpha value of 75.66, while the molecule "CC1=CCO[C@@H]1O[CH+][NH-]" has an alpha value of 77.58. The former has an aromatic ring, while the latter is an alpha-amino acid.
3. Molecules with multiple functional groups (e.g., amines, alcohols, and/or carboxylic acids) tend to have lower alpha values compared to molecules with fewer or no functional groups. For example, the molecule "CC1=C[C@@H]2C[C@H]1CC2=O" has an alpha value of 80.62, while the molecule "CCNc1n[nH]c(=O)n1" has an alpha value of 71.69. The former contains two ketones and one alcohol, while the latter is a simple amine.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the alpha value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher alpha values than molecules without aromatic rings. For example, molecules such as CO[C@@H](C)[C@H]1O[C@H]1C=O and C[C@H]1[C@H]2OCC(=O)O[C@@H]12 both have alpha values greater than 70, while molecules such as C[C@H]1C23OC12[C@]3(O)C=O and CO[C@H]1[C@H]2OCC(O)[C@@H]21 have alpha values less than 70. This suggests that the presence of an aromatic ring can increase the alpha value.
2. Molecules with multiple functional groups tend to have higher alpha values than molecules with fewer functional groups. For example, the alpha value for CC#C[C@@H](C)CCCO is 92.23, while the alpha value for C[C@@H](O)C(=O)C(F)(F)F is only 51.67. This suggests that the presence of multiple functional groups can increase the alpha value.
3. Molecules with positively charged nitrogen atoms tend to have higher alpha values than molecules with negatively charged or uncharged nitrogen atoms. For example, the alpha value for C[NH2+]=C(NC1CC1)C(=O)[O-] is 71.28, while the alpha value for NH-C1OC[C@@H]1C#CCO is 75.87. This suggests that the presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom can increase the alpha value.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the alpha value:
1. Molecules with multiple rings or complex structures tend to have higher alpha values. For example, C[C@@]12C=C[C@@]3(CO3)[C@@H]1O2 and C1C[NH+]1C12CC(C1)C2 have high alpha values due to their complex structures.
2. Molecules with unsaturated bonds, such as alkenes or aromatic compounds, tend to have lower alpha values. For example, CC#CCO and C#CCC(C#N)CC#C have lower alpha values due to their unsaturated bonds.
3. Molecules with polar functional groups, such as alcohols or carboxylic acids, tend to have lower alpha values. For example, O=CC#C[C@@H]1C=CCO1 and C[C@@H]1O[C@]1(C)C(=O)C#N have lower alpha values due to their polar functional groups.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a beta-hydroxy group at position 3 have a lower alpha value compared to molecules without it.
Examples: C[C@@H]1CO[C@]1(C)[C@@H](C)O (80.96) vs. O=C1COCO[C@H]2C[C@@H]12 (68.56)
Rule 2: Molecules with an sp3-hybridized carbon at position 2 have a higher alpha value compared to molecules with an sp2-hybridized carbon at the same position.
Examples: C[C@@H]1C=CC[C@@H]1C (84.78) vs. C[C@H]1[C@H]2C(=O)CC[C@@H]2[C@@H]1C#N (80.12)
Rule 3: Molecules with a tertiary amino group have a lower alpha value compared to molecules without it.
Examples: CC[C@@H]1C[C@H]2C[C@H]2C(=O)C[C@@H]1C (87.91) vs. C[C@@H]1C[C@H]2C[C@H]2C(=O)C[C@@H]1C[N+](=O)[O-] (86.48)

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the alpha value of a molecule based on its structure/properties:
1. Molecules with multiple double bonds and/or aromatic rings tend to have higher alpha values compared to molecules with fewer or no double bonds and/or aromatic rings. For example, C#C[C@@H]1C[C@H](NO)C1 has an alpha value of 72.320, while CC(=O)C[C@@]1(C=O)CO1 has an alpha value of 69.849.
2. Molecules with amino groups or nitro groups tend to have lower alpha values compared to molecules without them. This is because the presence of these groups increases the molecular weight and thus decreases the alpha value. For example, Nc1coc(N)n1 has an alpha value of 52.570, while C#C[C@H](O)C1CC=CC1 has an alpha value of 81.879.
3. Molecules with more complex structures and/or more functional groups tend to have lower alpha values compared to molecules with simpler structures and/or fewer functional groups. This is because the complexity and/or number of functional groups increase the molecular weight and thus decrease the alpha value. For example, C#C[C@H]1C(=O)C[C@H]2C[N@H+]21 has an alpha value of 73.900, while Cc1conc1C(N)=O has an alpha value of 68.230.

================================

 1. Molecules with an alpha value above 80 are often organic heterocyclic compounds with at least one ring containing an amine or nitrogen atom.
2. Molecules with an alpha value below 70 are often small molecules with a low molecular weight and few heavy atoms.
3. Molecules with an alpha value around 80 are often organic compounds with a mix of heavy and light atoms, such as carbonyls, alcohols, ethers, and amines.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the alpha value:
1. Molecules with an alpha value above 80 are likely to be biomolecules such as proteins, peptides, or nucleic acids, which have complex and specific structures. For example, O=C1CCC2=CCCN12 has an alpha value of 80.669998 and is a member of the class of indolizines.
2. Molecules with an alpha value below 60 are likely to be small and simple organic molecules such as alcohols, ethers, or carboxylic acids. For example, CC1=CCNCC(=O)C1 has an alpha value of 74.099997 and is a member of the class of pyrrolizines.
3. Molecules with an alpha value close to 70 are likely to be transition state structures or reactive intermediates, such as carbocations, nitrenes, or carbenes. For example, C#CCNc1cc[nH]n1 has an alpha value of 75.959999 and is a member of the class of pyrazoles.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the alpha value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher alpha values than those without. This is because aromatic rings are planar and can have extensive delocalization of electron density, which increases the stability of the molecule and therefore increases the alpha value. For example, N#C[C@@H]1NCC=C[C@@H]1N has an alpha value of 76.470001, while CCOCC[C@@H](O)CC has an alpha value of 87.739998.
2. Molecules with multiple bonds between non-carbon atoms tend to have lower alpha values than those with only carbon-carbon bonds. This is because multiple bonds between non-carbon atoms are more reactive and less stable than carbon-carbon bonds, which decreases the stability of the molecule and therefore decreases the alpha value. For example, O=C1C[C@H]2OC[C@H]2CN1 has an alpha value of 71.419998, while CC#Cc1cn(C)cn1 has an alpha value of 90.860001.
3. Molecules with charged groups tend to have higher alpha values than those without. This is because charged groups have a strong influence on the overall stability of the molecule, which increases the alpha value. For example, C[N@@H+]1C[C@@]2(O)C[C@H]2[N@@H+]1 has an alpha value of 77.389999, while O=C1C[C@H]2OC[C@H]2CN1[C@@H]1O[C@H](COC)[C@@H](O)[C@H]1O has an alpha value of 60.590000.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the structure and properties of a molecule to its alpha value:
1. Molecules with more double bonds or aromatic rings tend to have a higher alpha value.
2. Molecules with anions or cations tend to have a higher alpha value.
3. Molecules with more complex structures or greater number of atoms tend to have a higher alpha value.

================================

 Based on the given molecules and their corresponding alpha values, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the alpha value:
1. The presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom in a molecule generally leads to a high alpha value, as seen in many of the molecules listed (e.g., CC[C@]12CC/N=C\OCC1, C#C[C@@H]1NC([NH-])O[C@@H]1C, [NH-]C1OC[C@H]2OCC[C@@H]12).
2. The presence of an aromatic ring or a conjugated system of double bonds can also lead to a high alpha value, as seen in many of the molecules listed (e.g., CC1(C)[C@H]2C(=O)[C@@H]3[C@H]2[N@@H+]31, C#C[C@@H]1NC([NH-])O[C@@H]1C, C[C@@]12C[C@@H]3[C@@H](N1)[C@]1(C)O[C@@H]1[C@@H]32).
3. The presence of a fused bicyclic or tricyclic structure can also lead to a high alpha value, as seen in many of the molecules listed (e.g., COCC#C[C@H]1N[C@H]1C, C[C@@]12CC/N=C\OCC1, O[C@@H]1C[C@H]2C[N@@H+]3[C@H]2[C@@H]3C1).
It is important to note that these are general trends and that other factors, such as the overall charge of the molecule, the presence of specific functional groups, and the overall molecular structure, can also influence the alpha value.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the alpha value:
1. Molecules with an alpha value greater than 70 are likely to be biologically active compounds. For example, O=C[C@]1(O)[C@H]2[C@H]3C[C@@H]1[C@H]32 has an alpha value of 72.500000 and is a natural product found in Homo sapiens.
2. Molecules with a high degree of unsaturation tend to have a high alpha value. For example, C[C@H]1CC(NO)C(=O)O1 has an alpha value of 70.029999 and contains multiple double bonds.
3. Molecules with a positively charged nitrogen atom tend to have a high alpha value. For example, N#C[C@@]12C[C@H]3[N@@H+]1C[C@]32N has an alpha value of 75.279999 and contains a protonated nitrogen atom.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the alpha value:
1. The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a molecule is generally associated with a high alpha value. This can be observed in molecules such as [NH-]C1OCC[C@@]12C[C@@H]2O, CC/C(=N/O)[C@H]1CO1, and C[C@@]1(O)C=C[C@H]2C[C@H]21. The carbonyl group is an electron-withdrawing group, which can increase the stability of the molecule's conjugate acid and lead to a higher alpha value.
2. The presence of a heteroatoms with high electronegativity, such as nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O), in a molecule is also associated with a high alpha value. This can be observed in molecules such as NC(=O)COCC1CC1, C#CC([NH2+]CCC)OC, and N#C[C@@H]1O[C@@H]1C#CC=O. The presence of these heteroatoms can increase the molecule's polarity, making it more reactive and easier to ionize, which can lead to a higher alpha value.
3. The presence of a tertiary amino group in a molecule is generally associated with a low alpha value. This can be observed in molecules such as CC[C@H]1C[C@H]2O[C@@]12C=O, C[C@@]12O[C@H]3[C@H](O)[C@]1(O)[C@H]32, and C/C(=N\O)C1(C)CCC1. The tertiary amino group is less reactive and less easily ionized compared to primary and secondary amino groups, which can result in a lower alpha value.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the alpha value:
1. The presence of certain functional groups like hydroxyl groups, amino groups, and cyano groups tend to increase the alpha value. For example, molecules like [NH-]c1cc(F)[nH+]cc1N, Cc1[nH]c(=O)ncc1F, and N#C[C@@H](N)CC1CCC1 have high alpha values due to the presence of these functional groups.
2. The presence of double bonds or triple bonds tend to increase the alpha value. For example, molecules like C#CC[C@@H]1[C@H](C)[C@@H]1OC, C#C[C@@]12O[C@H]3[C@@H]1[N@@H+](C)[C@H]32, and CCOc1ncccn1 have high alpha values due to the presence of double bonds or triple bonds.
3. The molecular weight of a molecule also plays a role in determining its alpha value. In general, molecules with higher molecular weights tend to have lower alpha values. However, this is not always the case, as some molecules with high alpha values have low molecular weights and vice versa. For example, Cc1[nH]c(=O)ncc1F has a molecular weight of 68.900002, but it has a relatively high alpha value of 68.900002. Similarly, CC[C@@H]1COC12CCC2 has a molecular weight of 85.440002, but it has a relatively low alpha value of 75.260002.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the alpha value:
1. Molecules with an sp3 hybridized nitrogen atom in their structure, such as amines, amino alcohols, and amino acids, tend to have a high alpha value. This is because the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom can easily donate a proton, leading to a more acidic solution. For example, NH3 (alpha value = 68.79) is an amine, while CC1(C)C(=O)COC1[NH-] (alpha value = 72.90) contains an amide nitrogen.
2. Molecules with a keto group (-C=O) tend to have a lower alpha value than their enol counterparts. This is because the keto group is less polar and less capable of donating a proton, leading to a less acidic solution. For example, the alpha value of acetamide (alpha value = 62.97) is lower than that of its enol form, acetohydroximic acid (alpha value = 76.41).
3. Molecules with an sp2 hybridized nitrogen atom in their structure, such as pyridines and pyrimidines, tend to have a moderate alpha value. This is because the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom is delocalized over the aromatic system, making it less likely to donate a proton. For example, Cc1cc(O)n(C)c1O (alpha value = 76.41) is a member of the pyrimidine family, while N#CCCOC(C)=O (alpha value = 63.68) contains a pyridine ring.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the alpha value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have higher alpha values. For example, C#CC[C@@]12CC(=O)[C@@H]1C2 and C#C[C@H]1[C@@H]2[N@H+]1[C@@H]1C[C@]21C both have high alpha values due to their unsaturated bonds.
2. Molecules with amino groups or carboxylic acid groups tend to have lower alpha values. For example, CO[CH+][NH2+][C@@]1(C)C[C@H]1O and N#C[C@H](O)c1ncc[nH]1 both have low alpha values due to their protonated amino and carboxylic acid groups.
3. Molecules with multiple chiral centers or complex ring systems tend to have higher alpha values. For example, C[C@@]12C=CC=C[C@@H](C1)O2 and C1O[C@H]2CN[C@@H]1[C@@H]1N[C@@H]12 both have high alpha values due to their complex ring systems and multiple chiral centers.

================================
