 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher number of double bonds and aromatic rings tend to have a lower HOMO value.
Explanation: Double bonds and aromatic rings are more stable and require less energy to form, resulting in a lower HOMO value.
Examples: C#CCCC[C@H](O)C#N, C#C[C@]12C[C@H]1[C@@H]1C[C@@H]1[C@H]2CC
Rule 2: Molecules with a higher number of ring nitrogens and amines tend to have a lower HOMO value.
Explanation: Nitrogens and amines are more electronegative and attract electrons, resulting in a lower HOMO value.
Examples: C[C@@H]1NC1(CO)CO, CNc1onc(C)[n+]1C
Rule 3: Molecules with a higher number of fluorines and other electron-withdrawing groups tend to have a higher HOMO value.
Explanation: Fluorines and other electron-withdrawing groups withdraw electrons from the molecule, making it easier for the molecule to donate electrons and increase the HOMO value.
Examples: C#CC#C[C@@H](C)O, CC1=CCc2oncc21

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Epsilon HOMO value:
1. Molecules with conjugated double bonds or triple bonds tend to have higher HOMO values. For example, C#CC#CCC1(O)CC1 and C#C[C@@H]1C=CN(C=O)C1 have high HOMO values due to the presence of multiple double bonds.
2. Molecules with nitrile groups (C#N) tend to have high HOMO values. For example, N#CC1(C[C@H]2CO2)CC1 and C[C@H]1O[C@@H]2C3[C@H](C)[N@@H+]3[C@H]12 have high HOMO values due to the presence of nitrile groups.
3. Molecules with amino groups (NH2+) tend to have low HOMO values. For example, [NH-]C1O[C@@H]2OCC[C@@H]2O1 and [NH-]C1OC[C@H]2CC[C@H]2O1 have low HOMO values due to the presence of amino groups.

================================

 1. Molecules with higher HOMO energy tend to donate electrons, while those with lower HOMO energy tend to accept electrons. Therefore, HOMO energy can be related to the electron donating/accepting capabilities of a molecule.
2. Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g. multiple bonds) or aromatic rings tend to have higher HOMO energy, as these functional groups are more capable of delocalizing electrons and stabilizing the molecular orbitals.
3. Heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur can affect the HOMO energy of a molecule. For example, the presence of lone pairs on these atoms can increase the electron density and raise the HOMO energy. Additionally, the type and position of these atoms in the molecule can also influence the HOMO energy.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the epsilon HOMO value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds, such as C=C or C#C, tend to have higher HOMO values. This is because the pi bonds in these molecules lead to a higher electron density, which increases the HOMO energy.
2. Molecules with acids or bases tend to have lower HOMO values. This is because the formation of hydrogen bonds in these molecules leads to a redistribution of electrons, which decreases the HOMO energy.
3. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher HOMO values. This is because the delocalized pi electrons in these molecules lead to a higher electron density, which increases the HOMO energy.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the HOMO value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds between a nitrogen atom and another atom/group tend to have higher HOMO values. For example, compounds like Cc1c[nH+]c([NH-])c(=O)o1 and c1cc(C[NH+]2CC2)on1 have higher HOMO values due to the presence of multiple bonds involving a nitrogen atom.
2. Molecules with heteroatoms like oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur in their structure tend to have higher HOMO values. This is because these heteroatoms have higher electronegativity than carbon, which makes them more likely to attract electrons towards themselves, leading to a higher HOMO value. For example, compounds like CO[C@H]1[C@H]2C(=O)C[C@]21C and O=C1CN[C@@H]2C[C@H]1[C@H]2O have higher HOMO values due to the presence of oxygen and nitrogen atoms in their structures.
3. Molecules with unsaturated bonds, such as double or triple bonds, tend to have higher HOMO values. This is because unsaturated bonds contain more pi (Ï€) electrons, which are delocalized over the entire molecule and can easily move around, leading to a higher HOMO value. For example, compounds like C#CCOC([NH-])COC and C#CC1(NC=O)COC1 have higher HOMO values due to the presence of multiple unsaturated bonds in their structures.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon HOMO value:
1. Increased conjugation leads to a higher HOMO value: Molecules with multiple bonds, aromatic rings, and conjugated systems often have higher HOMO values due to the delocalization of electrons within the molecule, which results in a lower energy requirement to donate an electron. For example, C#C[C@@H]1C[C@@]2(C=O)C[N@@H+]12 has a HOMO value of -6.881760, while C1=C[C@@]23C[C@H]4O[C@@H]2[C@@H]1[C@H]43 has a HOMO value of -5.959293.
2. Presence of oxygen atoms decreases the HOMO value: Molecules with oxygen atoms tend to have lower HOMO values due to the higher electronegativity of oxygen, which attracts the shared electrons and increases the energy required to donate an electron. For example, CO[C@H]1C[C@]1(O)C1CC1 has a HOMO value of -6.704885, while C[C@@H]1C[C@H]2C[C@@]2(C)O1 has a HOMO value of -6.851827.
3. Presence of multiple nitrogen atoms increases the HOMO value: Molecules with multiple nitrogen atoms often have higher HOMO values due to the availability of lone pairs of electrons on the nitrogen atoms, which can donate electrons to the molecular orbitals. For example, C[C@H]1O[C@H]([NH-])CCC1=O has a HOMO value of -6.819173, while Nc1cn2c(c1N)CC2 has a HOMO value of -4.650426.

================================

 1. Molecules with a higher number of HOMO values tend to be more reactive and unstable.
2. Molecules with multiple bonds, such as C=C or C#C, tend to have higher HOMO values.
3. Molecules with aromatic rings or conjugated systems tend to have higher HOMO values.

================================

 Based on the given molecules and their corresponding HOMO values, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon HOMO value:
1. Increased unsaturation in a molecule generally leads to a higher HOMO value. This can be seen in the molecules C1=CC2(CC2)[C@@H]2N[C@H]1C2=O and c1cccc2c1[C@H]1OC[C@H]12, which have high HOMO values due to their unsaturated nature.
2. The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms in a molecule can lead to a higher HOMO value. This can be seen in the molecules C[C@@H]1O[C@@H]2C[C@@H]1[N@H+]1C[C@@H]12 and N#C[C@@H]1N[C@@H]1CC(N)=O, which both have multiple nitrogen atoms and high HOMO values.
3. The presence of multiple heteroatoms (e.g. nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur) in a molecule can lead to a higher HOMO value. This can be seen in the molecules Cn1cnc2c1C=CC2 and O=C1CCC(=O)C1O, which both contain multiple heteroatoms and have high HOMO values.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon HOMO value:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds (e.g., C=C, C#C, etc.) tend to have higher epsilon HOMO values compared to molecules with single bonds. This is because multiple bonds allow for easier delocalization of electrons, which increases the energy level of the HOMO.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher epsilon HOMO values compared to molecules without aromatic rings. This is because aromatic rings allow for easy delocalization of electrons, which increases the energy level of the HOMO.
3. Molecules with heteroatoms (e.g., N, O, F, etc.) tend to have higher epsilon HOMO values compared to molecules without heteroatoms. This is because heteroatoms have a higher electronegativity than carbon, which pulls electrons away from the carbon atom and increases the energy level of the HOMO.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon HOMO value:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds between nonmetals, such as C=O or C=C, tend to have lower HOMO values. For example, Cc1cc(C)c(=O)on1 has a HOMO value of -7.05, while C=CCO has a HOMO value of -6.87.
2. Molecules with lone pairs of electrons on an atom tend to have higher HOMO values. For example, COc1n[nH]cc1O has a HOMO value of -5.40, while Cc1nc[nH]c1O has a HOMO value of -5.29.
3. Molecules with positively charged nitrogen atoms tend to have lower HOMO values. For example, C[C@H]1[N@H+]2C[C@]1(C)C2 has a HOMO value of -6.05, while N#C[C@H]1[C@H]2C34OC23[C@]14N has a HOMO value of -6.65.

================================

 1. Molecules with a more negative HOMO value tend to donate electrons and act as reducing agents, while molecules with a more positive HOMO value tend to accept electrons and act as oxidizing agents.
2. Molecules with multiple bonds between non-CCN(CC) atoms (e.g., C=O, C=N) tend to have a higher HOMO value due to the pi-bonding electrons being closer to the atom with the lone pair, making it easier to donate those electrons.
3. Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., benzene, pyrrole) tend to have a higher HOMO value due to the delocalized pi-electron system being more stable and easier to donate electrons.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon HOMO value:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds between non-CCN sp-hybridized atoms tend to have higher HOMO values. For example, molecules with triple bonds or aromatic systems usually have higher HOMO energy levels compared to molecules with single bonds.
2. Molecules with lone pairs or un shared electrons tend to have higher HOMO values. For instance, molecules with nitrogen or oxygen atoms with lone pairs, such as amines, alcohols or ethers, often have higher HOMO energies compared to molecules without these functional groups.
3. Molecules with positively charged species or cations tend to have lower HOMO values. This is because cations have fewer electrons and hence have lower HOMO energies compared to neutral molecules or anions.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon HOMO value:
1. Increased conjugation and aromaticity tend to increase the HOMO energy level. For example, molecules with multiple double bonds or aromatic rings often have higher HOMO values.
2. The presence of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) can decrease the HOMO energy level. EWGs such as nitrile groups, carbonyls, and halogens can withdraw electrons from the molecule, making it more difficult to donate electrons and thus decreasing the HOMO energy level.
3. The presence of electron-donating groups (EDGs) can increase the HOMO energy level. EDGs such as amino groups, alkyl groups, and hydroxy groups can donate electrons to the molecule, making it easier to donate electrons and thus increasing the HOMO energy level.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher number of ring systems tend to have lower HOMO values.
Explanation: The presence of multiple rings in a molecule can increase its complexity, leading to a more stable system with a lower energy HOMO level.
Example: C1CC2(C1)OC[C@]21CO1, C1O[C@H]2C[C@@H]3O[C@H]2[C@H]13
Rule 2: Molecules with an sp3 hybridized carbon with a HOMO value tend to have lower HOMO values.
Explanation: Sp3 hybridized carbons have a tetrahedral geometry which leads to a more stable system with a lower energy HOMO level.
Example: C[C@H]1O[C@@H]2[C@H]3O[C@@H]2[C@H]13, CO[C@@H](C)[C@H]1CO[C@H]1C
Rule 3: Molecules with a higher number of lone pairs or delocalized electrons tend to have higher HOMO values.
Explanation: Lone pairs or delocalized electrons increase the electron density in a molecule, leading to a less stable system with a higher energy HOMO level.
Example: COC[C@@H](O)[C@@H](O)C=O, C#CC[C@H]1C[N@H+]1CC#C

================================

 1. Molecules with a higher degree of unsaturation (e.g. double or triple bonds) tend to have a higher HOMO value, as there are more pi (p-orbital) electrons available for bonding with an electron donor.
2. Molecules with an aromatic ring or a heteroarene (e.g. pyridine, pyrrole, thiophene) tend to have a higher HOMO value, as the pi-electron system in these compounds is more stabilized and delocalized.
3. Molecules with an organic cation or a protonated amino group tend to have a lower HOMO value, as the positively charged species will have a lower energy for the highest occupied molecular orbital.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon HOMO value:
1. Molecules with multiple C=C bonds tend to have lower Epsilon HOMO values compared to molecules with single C=C bonds. For example, C#C[C@@]1(C#N)N[C@H]2C[C@H]21 has a HOMO value of -6.647741, while C#C[C@]12CCC[C@@]12 has a HOMO value of -6.315763.
2. Molecules with high levels of unsaturation tend to have higher Epsilon HOMO values compared to molecules with fewer double and triple bonds. For example, CC#CC1(C)C23CC12O3 has a HOMO value of -6.315763, while CC1(C)C23CC12O3 has a HOMO value of -6.046370.
3. Molecules with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs), such as -C#N, -Cl, -Br, etc., tend to have lower Epsilon HOMO values compared to molecules without EWGs or with electron-donating groups (EDGs). For example, N#CC#Cc1ccn[nH]1 has a HOMO value of -7.015096, while CC#C[C@H]1[C@H]2C[C@@H]1[C@@H]1CO[C@@H]12 has a HOMO value of -6.770193.
It's important to note that these rules are not absolute and there can be exceptions, but they provide a general guide for predicting Epsilon HOMO values based on molecular structure.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon HOMO value:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds (e.g., C=O, C=N) tend to have higher HOMO values compared to molecules with single bonds. For example, CC#C[C@@H](C)N(C)C=O and C#C[C@H]1OC[C@H]2CO[C@]21C both have high epsilon HOMO values due to their multiple bonds.
2. Molecules with conjugated systems or aromatic rings tend to have higher HOMO values compared to molecules without. For example, Cc1cc(C#N)[nH]c1C and C1=C[C@H]2[C@@H]3C[C@H]2C=C[C@H]13 both have high epsilon HOMO values due to their aromatic rings.
3. Molecules with positively charged nitrogen atoms tend to have lower HOMO values compared to molecules without. This is because the positively charged nitrogen atom attracts electrons from the surrounding atoms, reducing the molecule's overall electron density and therefore its HOMO value. For example, N=CN1CCCNC1=O and O=C1O[C@]23C[C@@H]4[C@H]2N[C@@]143 both have low epsilon HOMO values due to their positively charged nitrogen atoms.

================================

 1. Molecules with aromatic rings and multiple bonds tend to have higher HOMO values due to the stabilization of electrons in these structures.
2. Molecules with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitrogen oxides, carbonyls, and acetyls tend to have lower HOMO values due to the depletion of electrons in these structures.
3. Molecules with heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur tend to have higher HOMO values due to the polarity and stabilization of electrons around these atoms.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Epsilon HOMO value:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds, such as C=C or Câ‰¡C, tend to have higher HOMO values compared to molecules with single bonds. For example, C#CCC#CC=O has a HOMO value of -7.341632, while C=CCC#CC=O has a HOMO value of -7.183806.
2. Molecules with amino groups (NH2-) tend to have lower HOMO values compared to molecules without amino groups. For example, NH- and N#CC(=O)[C@H]1O[C@H]1C#N have HOMO values of -6.623251 and -8.743018, respectively.
3. Molecules with positive charged ions, such as [NH-][CH+]O[C@@H]1COC[C@@H]1O, tend to have higher HOMO values compared to molecules without charged ions. This is because the positive charge in the molecule leads to an increase in the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital, making it easier to donate electrons and form a cation.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher HOMO value tend to be more polarized and have a higher electron density.
Rule 2: Molecules with an aromatic ring or multiple conjugated double bonds tend to have a higher HOMO value.
Rule 3: Molecules with an sp3 hybridized nitrogen atom in the heterocycle or an amino group tend to have a lower HOMO value.

================================

 Here are three possible rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the epsilon HOMO value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds between non-CCN sp hybridized atoms (e.g. C=C, C=O, C#N) tend to have higher HOMO values compared to similar molecules without such bonds.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have lower HOMO values compared to similar molecules without aromatic rings.
3. Molecules with amino groups tend to have lower HOMO values compared to similar molecules without amino groups.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the HOMO value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds tend to have higher HOMO values than those without. For example, N#C[C@@H]1C=CCCCC1 and CC1=C([NH-])C=CN=CN1 have higher HOMO values due to their aromatic nature.
2. Molecules with multiple nitrogen atoms or amino groups tend to have higher HOMO values. For example, Cc1c[nH]c2c1OCO2 and N#C[C@@H]1C=CCCCC1 have high HOMO values due to their amino groups.
3. Molecules with positive charges tend to have lower HOMO values. For example, C[NH2+]1C[C@@]2(O)C[C@@]12C#N has a lower HOMO value due to the positively charged nitrogen atom.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with aromatic amines tend to have high HOMO values.
Rule 2: Molecules with multiple bonds between non-rotatable centers tend to have high HOMO values.
Rule 3: Molecules with unsaturated bonds and lone pairs on electronegative atoms tend to have high HOMO values.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon HOMO value:
1. Molecules with multiple carbonyl groups tend to have lower HOMO values compared to molecules with fewer or no carbonyl groups. For example, N#CCCCCOC=O has a lower HOMO value than C#CC(=O)CCOCC. This is because the multiple carbonyl groups in the former molecule increase the electronegativity of the molecule, making it more difficult to donate electrons and thus lowering the HOMO value.
2. Molecules with amino groups tend to have higher HOMO values compared to molecules without amino groups. This is because the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom can donate electrons to the molecule, increasing the HOMO value. For example, Cc1c(C)n(C[C@@H]2O[C@@H]2CO)c2ccccc12 has a higher HOMO value than C#CC1[NH2+][C@H]2C[C@@H]3[C@H]2[N@H+]13 due to the presence of the amino group in the former molecule.
3. Molecules with aromatic systems tend to have higher HOMO values compared to molecules without aromatic systems. This is because the delocalized pi electrons in the aromatic system can easily donate electrons, increasing the HOMO value. For example, Cc1cc(C(N)=O)on1 has a higher HOMO value than COCCN(C)C=O due to the presence of the aromatic system in the former molecule.

================================

 1. Molecules with a higher number of double bonds tend to have a lower HOMO value, as there is a decrease in the overall energy of the molecule due to the stabilization of the pi electrons.
2. Aromatic compounds tend to have lower HOMO values compared to their non-aromatic counterparts, as the pi electrons in the aromatic ring are more stable and delocalized.
3. Molecules with a negative charge or a positively charged nitrogen atom tend to have a higher HOMO value, as there is an increase in the overall energy of the molecule due to the presence of an unpaired electron or a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon HOMO value:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds (e.g., C=O, C#N) tend to have higher HOMO values compared to molecules with single bonds. This is because multiple bonds allow for greater delocalization of electrons, which increases the molecule's ability to donate electrons and thus has a higher HOMO value.
2. Aromatic systems (e.g., benzene, pyridine) tend to have lower HOMO values compared to molecules without aromatic systems. This is because aromatic systems are more stable and have a lower tendency to donate electrons, thus having a lower HOMO value.
3. Molecules with heteroatoms (e.g., N, O, S) tend to have higher HOMO values compared to molecules without heteroatoms. This is because heteroatoms have a higher electronegativity than carbon, which pulls the electron density towards itself and creates a partial positive charge on the carbon atomé‚»è¿‘çš„. This partial positive charge enhances the molecule's ability to donate electrons and thus has a higher HOMO value.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon HOMO value:
1. Molecules with multiple nitrogen atoms tend to have higher epsilon HOMO values due to the electron-rich nature of nitrogen. For example, N#C[C@H]1N[C@H]1[C@H]1CCO1 has a high epsilon HOMO value of -6.838222.
2. Molecules with conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings tend to have higher epsilon HOMO values due to the delocalized pi-electron system. For example, C#CC1(C#N)CC(C)C1 has a high epsilon HOMO value of -6.873596.
3. Molecules with polar functional groups such as amines, alcohols, carboxylic acids, and ethers tend to have lower epsilon HOMO values due to the polarity of these groups. For example, N#CC1=CC[C@H](O)[C@@H]1N has a moderate epsilon HOMO value of -6.645020.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the HOMO value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds between non-metals tend to have higher HOMO values. For example, molecules with C=C or C#C bonds tend to have higher HOMO values compared to molecules with single bonds.
2. Molecules with heteroatoms like O, N, or S tend to have higher HOMO values compared to molecules without these atoms. This is because these atoms have higher electronegativity and can attract more electrons to the molecule, resulting in a higher HOMO value.
3. Molecules with unsaturated rings tend to have higher HOMO values compared to molecules with saturated rings. This is because unsaturated rings have more pi-electrons, which can contribute to the HOMO level.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher number of double bonds or aromatic rings tend to have a higher HOMO value.
Explanation: Double bonds and aromatic rings are electron-rich areas in a molecule, which means they have a high density of electrons. This high electron density makes it easier for the molecule to donate electrons and thus have a higher HOMO value.
Example: C#C[C@@H]1C[C@H]2C[C@@H]1C2 has one double bond and one aromatic ring, and it has a HOMO value of -6.402839.
Rule 2: Molecules with a negative ionic charge or a protonated amino group tend to have a lower HOMO value.
Explanation: Negative ionic species and protonated amino groups are more stable and require fewer electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration. Therefore, they tend to have a lower HOMO value.
Example: [NH-]C1O[C@H]2[C@H]3C[N@H+]3C[C@@H]12 has a HOMO value of -6.566107.
Rule 3: Molecules with a positive ionic charge or a negatively charged oxygen atom tend to have a higher HOMO value.
Explanation: Positive ionic species and negatively charged oxygen atoms are more reactive and require more electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration. Therefore, they tend to have a higher HOMO value.
Example: C[C@H]1[C@@H]2[C@H](O)[C@H]1[C@@H]1O[C@@H]12 has a HOMO value of -6.791962.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon HOMO value:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher HOMO values. This is because the delocalized pi electrons in the aromatic ring can easily donate electrons to an acceptor molecule, resulting in a higher HOMO energy. For example, Nc1cnc2ocnn12 has a HOMO value of -6.168821, while Cc1cc(C)c(C#N)o1 has a HOMO value of -6.351138.
2. Molecules with unsaturated bonds (e.g. double or triple bonds) tend to have higher HOMO values. This is because the pi electrons in the unsaturated bond can easily donate electrons to an acceptor molecule, resulting in a higher HOMO energy. For example, CC(=O)[C@@]12C[C@H]3C[N@@H+]1[C@H]32 has a HOMO value of -6.530733, while C#CC[C@@H]1OC[C@@H]1OC has a HOMO value of -6.688559.
3. Molecules with polar functional groups (e.g. amino, hydroxy, carbonyl) tend to have higher HOMO values. This is because the polar functional group can easily donate electrons to an acceptor molecule, resulting in a higher HOMO energy. For example, Nc1c(F)occc1=O has a HOMO value of -5.828679, while C[C@@H]1O[C@H]2[C@@H]1C[C@@H]2N1 has a HOMO value of -6.612367.

================================

 1. Molecules with a higher number of HOMO orbitals tend to have a higher HOMO energy value.
2. Molecules with aromatic systems tend to have lower HOMO energy values compared to molecules without aromatic systems.
3. Molecules with multiple bonds tend to have higher HOMO energy values compared to molecules with single bonds.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a high HOMO value tend to be more reactive as they have a large energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO, making it easier to donate electrons.
Inference: Molecules with a high HOMO value are more reactive.
Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic rings or multiple bonds tend to have a high HOMO value.
Inference: Aromatic rings and multiple bonds contribute to a high HOMO value.
Rule 3: Molecules with electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyls or acetylides tend to have a low HOMO value.
Inference: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease the HOMO value.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher number of nitrogen atoms in the structure tend to have a lower HOMO value.
Rule 2: Molecules with multiple bonds between carbon and nitrogen atoms tend to have a lower HOMO value.
Rule 3: Molecules with aromatic rings and conjugated systems tend to have a higher HOMO value.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the Epsilon HOMO value:
1. Molecules with an aromatic ring or multiple conjugated bonds tend to have higher HOMO values due to the delocalization of electrons within the ring or bonds, making it easier to donate electrons.
Example: Cc1coc(O)nc1=O, N#C[C@@H](CO)C[C@H]1CO1
2. Molecules with heteroatoms like nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur in their structure tend to have higher HOMO values due to the polarity and reactivity of these atoms.
Example: Cn1nc2ncoc2n1, C[C@@]12[C@@H]3OC[C@H]1O[C@@H]32
3. Molecules with a positively charged nitrogen atom in their structure tend to have lower HOMO values due to the attraction of the electron density to the positively charged nitrogen atom.
Example: C[C@@]12O[C@H]3C[C@@H]1O[C@@H]32, O=C1C=C[C@@H]2C[C@]12CO

================================

 Here are three possible rules based on the given data that relate the structure/properties of a molecule to its epsilon HOMO value:
1. Molecules with more double bonds and/or aromatic rings tend to have higher epsilon HOMO values, as these functional groups are electron-rich and can easily donate electrons.
2. Molecules with positively charged nitrogen atoms or protonated nitrogens tend to have lower epsilon HOMO values, as these species are electron-deficient and cannot easily donate electrons.
3. Molecules with hydroxyl groups or other electronegative atoms next to a double bond or aromatic ring tend to have lower epsilon HOMO values, as the electron density around these groups is drawn away from the double bond or aromatic ring and cannot easily participate in electron donation.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon HOMO value:
1. Increased unsaturation in a molecule generally leads to a higher HOMO value. For example, C#CC[C@]1(C)OC[C@H]1O and C#CC(O)(C#N)C#N have high HOMO values due to their multiple double bonds.
2. The presence of certain functional groups can also impact the HOMO value. For instance, amino groups tend to increase the HOMO value, as seen in [NH-][CH+]Oc1occc1N and C#CC[C@]1(C)OC[C@H]1O. On the other hand, carbonyl groups tend to decrease the HOMO value, as seen in COCc1cc[nH]c1 and CC1=C[C@@H](C)OC(=O)C1.
3. The molecular structure and connectivity can also influence the HOMO value. For example, C#CC1(COCCO)CCCC1 has a lower HOMO value than C#CC[C@]1(C)OC[C@H]1O, despite both molecules containing a similar number of double bonds, because the former has an additional functional group and a more complex structure. Similarly, C[C@]12C[C@H]1CC=CCO2 has a lower HOMO value than C#CC[C@]1(C)OC[C@H]1O, because the former is a ring structure with less unsaturation.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher HOMO value tend to be more polarized and have a greater tendency to donate electrons. Therefore, molecules with a higher HOMO value are more likely to be positively charged. This can be observed in the molecules such as C[CH+]1C=C([NH-])OC=C1N and [NH-][C@@H]1NC[C@@H]2CO[C@H]1O2, where the HOMO value is higher and the molecule has a positive charge.
Rule 2: Molecules with a higher HOMO value tend to have a stronger dipole moment. Therefore, molecules with a higher HOMO value are more likely to have an permanent dipole moment. This can be observed in the molecule such as C[C@@]1(O)[C@@H]2C=CCC[C@@H]21, where the HOMO value is higher and the molecule has a permanent dipole moment.
Rule 3: Molecules with a higher HOMO value tend to be more reactive. Therefore, molecules with a higher HOMO value are more likely to act as nucleophiles or electrophiles in chemical reactions. This can be observed in the molecule such as C#C[C@@H]1C(=O)[C@@H]2O[C@]12C, where the HOMO value is higher and the molecule is more reactive.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a high HOMO value tend to have multiple ring systems, with at least one aromatic ring. This is because aromatic rings have a high degree of electron delocalization, which raises the energy of the HOMO level.
Rule 2: Molecules with a high HOMO value tend to have electronegative atoms such as O, N, and F, located close to the aromatic rings. This is because these electronegative atoms attract electrons from the aromatic rings, which raises the energy of the HOMO level.
Rule 3: Molecules with a high HOMO value tend to have multiple bonds, such as C=O, C#N, and C#C, located near the aromatic rings. This is because multiple bonds have a higher bond order and a lower bond energy, which allows for easier electron delocalization and raises the energy of the HOMO level.

================================

 Based on the provided data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon HOMO value:
1. Increased conjugation in a molecule leads to a higher HOMO value.
2. Presence of electronegative atoms such as fluorine, oxygen, and nitrogen increases the HOMO value.
3. Presence of multiple heteroatoms in a molecule increases the HOMO value.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the epsilon HOMO value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds between non-main group elements (e.g., C=C, C=O, etc.) tend to have higher epsilon HOMO values. For example, molecules like Cc1ccc(C)[nH]1, C#C[C@H]1NC(=O)C(=O)N1, and CC1(C)C=C(CO)CO1 all have high epsilon HOMO values.
2. Molecules with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like carbonyl, nitrile, or acyl groups tend to have lower epsilon HOMO values. For example, molecules like Nc1c(O)cnnc1F, C#Cc1nc(N)c(O)[nH]1, and NC(=O)c1coc(=O)o1 all have low epsilon HOMO values.
3. Molecules with aromatic systems and conjugated pi-systems tend to have high epsilon HOMO values. For example, molecules like Cc1ccc(C)[nH]1, CCOC(=O)C(=O)OC, and C#C[C@@H]1CCCNC1=O all have high epsilon HOMO values due to their aromatic systems.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon HOMO value:
1. Increased unsaturation in a molecule generally leads to a higher HOMO value. This can be observed in the molecules C1=N\CC[C@H]2O[C@H]2CO/1 and CC#C[C@H]1C[C@H](C#N)O1, which have high HOMO values due to their multiple double bonds.
2. The presence of certain functional groups can also affect the HOMO value. For example, the molecule N#CCCOCC1COC1 has a high HOMO value due to the presence of the cyanide group, which is known to increase electron density and thereby raise the HOMO energy level.
3. Charged molecules tend to have higher HOMO values than neutral molecules. This is because charged molecules have an extra energy term associated with their charge, which raises their overall energy level and therefore increases the HOMO value. An example of this is the molecule C[N@@H+]1[C@@H]2[C@H]3N[C@@H]2[C@]31C#N, which has a high HOMO value due to the protonated nitrogen atom.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with higher HOMO values tend to have more electronegative atoms, such as oxygen and nitrogen, in their structures.
Rule 2: Molecules with multiple bonds, such as double and triple bonds, tend to have higher HOMO values due to the greater delocalization of electrons.
Rule 3: Molecules with functional groups that have high HOMO values, such as ketones, aldehydes, and amines, tend to have higher overall HOMO values.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher HOMO value tend to be more polarized and have a greater tendency to donate electrons. Therefore, molecules with higher HOMO values are more likely to act as nucleophiles in chemical reactions.
Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic rings or multiple bonds tend to have higher HOMO values. This is because the delocalized pi-electron system in these molecules makes it easier to donate electrons and thus increases the HOMO value.
Rule 3: Molecules with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g. carbonyls, cyano groups) tend to have lower HOMO values. This is because the electron-withdrawing groups make it harder for the molecule to donate electrons and thus decreases the HOMO value.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon HOMO value:
1. Molecules with multiple ring systems or aromatic systems tend to have higher HOMO values. For example, many of the molecules with HOMO values over 5.5 are heterocyclic compounds, such as N#CC(=O)C[C@@H]1C[C@@H]1O and C#Cc1nc[nH]c1CC.
2. Molecules with multiple functional groups, such as alcohols, carbonyls, and carboxylates tend to have lower HOMO values. For example, CC1(CCO)CC1 and C[C@@H](CO)C1=CCOC1 have HOMO values around -7.
3. Molecules with unsaturated bonds, such as double or triple bonds tend to have higher HOMO values. For example, C#CC1=C[C@H]2C=C[C@@H]1C2 and C[C@@H](O)CC1=CCOC1 both have HOMO values over 5.5.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the epsilon HOMO value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds, such as C=O, C#N, or C#C, tend to have higher epsilon HOMO values.
2. Molecules with functional groups containing N, O, or F atoms, such as amines, carbonyls, or pyrimidines, tend to have higher epsilon HOMO values.
3. Molecules with aromatic rings, such as pyridines or pyrroles, tend to have higher epsilon HOMO values.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon HOMO value:
1. Molecules with conjugated systems or aromatic rings tend to have higher HOMO values due to the delocalization of electrons, which makes it easier to donate electrons. For example, Nc1ccc(O)c(F)c1 has a HOMO value of -5.167442, while CCO[C@@]12[C@H]3[C@H]4[C@@H]1[N@H+]4[C@H]32 has a HOMO value of -5.866775.
2. Molecules with multiple bonds, such as carbonyls, nitrones, and ylides, tend to have lower HOMO values due to the localization of electrons, which makes it harder to donate electrons. For example, CC(=O)N1[C@@H]2C=CC[C@@H]21 has a HOMO value of -6.302157, while O=CCCCOC=O has a HOMO value of -7.164758.
3. Molecules with polar or ionizable groups, such as amines, alcohols, and carboxylic acids, tend to have higher HOMO values due to the partial negative charge on the atom, which makes it easier to donate electrons. For example, C[C@@H]1C[C@@]12CN2[CH+]2C[C@@H]21 has a HOMO value of -6.332089, while [NH-][C@H]1COCC(=O)CO1 has a HOMO value of -6.824616.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the epsilon HOMO value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds between non-metals tend to have higher HOMO values compared to those with single bonds between non-metals. For example, N-oxides (e.g., N#C[NH2+]) generally have higher HOMO values than amines (e.g., CNc1nonc1NC). This is because multiple bonds between non-metals involve the orbital interaction of both atoms, resulting in a more stabilized HOMO.
2. Aromatic compounds tend to have higher HOMO values compared to their non-aromatic counterparts. For example, CO[C@H]1C[C@H]1C has a lower HOMO value compared to Cc1nc2c(o1)C=CC2 due to the presence of an aromatic ring in the latter. This is because aromatic compounds have delocalized pi-electrons, which results in a destabilized HOMO.
3. Molecules with more positive charges tend to have higher HOMO values. This is because positively charged species require more energy to remove an electron from their HOMO. For example, C[C@H]1C[C@]12C=CC(=O)O2 and C[C@]12COC[C@@H](N1)[C@H]2O have similar HOMO values, but the former is more positive, resulting in a slightly higher HOMO value.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher HOMO value tend to have a more negatively charged LUMO and be more prone to accept electrons.
Rule 2: Molecules with aromaticity or multiple conjugated double bonds tend to have a higher HOMO value, as the delocalized pi-electron system leads to a lower energy for the highest occupied molecular orbital.
Rule 3: Molecules with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitriles, carbonyls, and acetylides tend to have a lower HOMO value, as the group decreases the availability of electrons in the molecule and raises the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a higher HOMO value tend to have more electron-rich moieties, such as amines, hydroxyl groups, and carboxylates.
Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic rings or multiple conjugated bonds tend to have higher HOMO values, as these systems have delocalized electrons and a stabilized electron distribution.
Rule 3: Molecules with more complex structures, such as those with multiple stereocenters or cyclic systems, often have higher HOMO values due to the presence of additional orbital interactions and electronic density.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the Epsilon HOMO value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with multiple bonds between non-CCN sp- hybridized atoms (e.g. C=C, C=O, C=N) tend to have higher HOMO values compared to those with single bonds. This is because multiple bonds create a higher degree of unsaturation in the molecule, leading to a more stable molecular orbitals closer to the HOMO energy level.
Example: C#C[C@@H]1[C@H](C)[C@]1(C)OC has a HOMO value of -6.157937.
2. Molecules with an sp3-hybridized carbon bonded to an oxygen or nitrogen atom tend to have lower HOMO values compared to those without. This is because the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen or nitrogen atom occupy molecular orbitals closer to the HOMO energy level, reducing the availability of electrons on the carbon atom for bonding with other molecular orbitals.
Example: CCO[CH+][NH2+]CC=O has a HOMO value of -6.552502.
3. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have lower HOMO values compared to those without, especially if the ring contains multiple conjugated double bonds. This is because the delocalized pi-electrons in the aromatic ring create a more stable molecular orbital system, shifting the HOMO energy level to a lower value.
Example: c1nc2o[cH+]ncc2[nH]1 has a HOMO value of -7.319862.
Note: These rules are not absolute and may have exceptions depending on the specific structure of the molecule.
