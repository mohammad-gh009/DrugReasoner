 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict molecules' ESOL values based on their structures and properties:
1. Molecules with hydroxyl groups or carboxylic acid groups tend to have lower ESOL values than molecules without these functional groups. For example, OCC(O)CO has an ESOL value of 0.688, while CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C has an ESOL value of -4.870. This suggests that the presence of hydroxyl groups or carboxylic acid groups in a molecule can increase its solubility in water.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher ESOL values than molecules without aromatic rings. For example, c1ccccc1 has an ESOL value of -3.099, while Cc1cc(C)c(C)cc1C has an ESOL value of -3.664. This suggests that the presence of aromatic rings in a molecule can increase its solubility in water.
3. Molecules with halogenated aromatic rings tend to have lower ESOL values than molecules with unsubstituted aromatic rings. For example, Cc1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1 has an ESOL value of -4.870, while Clc1cccc2cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc12 has an ESOL value of -7.343. This suggests that the presence of halogen substituents on aromatic rings can decrease a molecule's solubility in water.

================================

 After analyzing the given molecules and their corresponding water solubility data/ESOL values, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict a molecule's ESOL value based on its structure/properties:
1. Molecules with aromatic groups and conjugated systems tend to have lower ESOL values, indicating less solubility in water. This is because such molecules have a high affinity for each other, leading to reduced solubility in polar solvents like water. For example, Cc1c2ccccc2cc3ccccc13 has a ESOL value of -4.870, indicating low solubility in water.
2. The presence of certain functional groups such as amides, carbonyls, and sulfones can increase a molecule's ESOL value, suggesting higher solubility in water. These groups can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, enhancing the solubility of the molecule. For example, O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)CC=C has an ESOL value of -1.706, indicating fair solubility in water due to the presence of carbonyl and amide groups.
3. Molecules with long hydrocarbon chains or large alkyl groups tend to have lower ESOL values, suggesting lower solubility in water. This is because the nonpolar nature of these molecules reduces their affinity for polar solvents like water. For example, CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO has an ESOL value of -4.231, indicating low solubility in water due to the presence of a long hydrocarbon chain.
It's important to note that these rules are not absolute and may have exceptions depending on the specific molecular structure and properties. However, they can provide a useful starting point for predicting a molecule's solubility in water based on its chemical composition and structure.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the ESOL value of a molecule based on its structure/properties:
1. Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms or bromine atoms tend to have higher ESOL values. This can be seen in the cases of Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, Clc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1, and CCCCBr. Therefore, the presence of multiple halogens in a molecule can indicate a higher ESOL value.
2. Molecules with conjugated systems or aromatic rings tend to have lower ESOL values. This can be observed in the cases of C=CC=O, Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C, and Nc1ccccc1Cl. The presence of an aromatic ring or a conjugated system in a molecule can suggest a lower ESOL value.
3. Molecules with hydroxy groups or amino groups tend to have lower ESOL values. This can be seen in the cases of COc1ccc(Cl)cc1, CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O, and CCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCC. Therefore, the presence of hydroxy or amino groups in a molecule can indicate a lower ESOL value.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with electron-withdrawing groups tend to have lower ESOL values, while molecules with electron-donating groups tend to have higher ESOL values.
Explanation: Electron-withdrawing groups decrease the polarity of a molecule, making it less soluble in water. On the other hand, electron-donating groups increase the polarity of a molecule, making it more soluble in water.
Example: Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a lower ESOL value (-2.640) compared to Cc1ccc(cc1)S(=O)(=O)N (-1.815), because the former has an electron-withdrawing group (nitro) while the latter has an electron-donating group (sulfinyl).
Rule 2: Molecules with halogens (especially bromine and chlorine) tend to have lower ESOL values.
Explanation: Halogens are highly electronegative, which increases the polarity of a molecule and decreases its solubility in water.
Example: Brc1cccc2ccccc12 has an ESOL value of -4.298, while Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has an ESOL value of -2.640. The reason for this is that bromine is more electronegative than carbon, which decreases the solubility of the molecule in water.
Rule 3: Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher ESOL values.
Explanation: Aromatic rings are highly polar and can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, increasing the solubility of the molecule.
Example: Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has an ESOL value of -2.640, while Cc1ccc(cc1)S(=O)(=O)N has an ESOL value of -1.815. The reason for this is that the former has an aromatic ring, which increases its solubility in water.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict molecules' ESOL values:
1. Molecules with halogenated aromatic rings tend to have lower ESOL values compared to those without halogens. For example, Clc1ccc(Oc2ccc(cc2)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1 has an ESOL value of -5.361, while Cc1ccccc1C has an ESOL value of -3.296. This suggests that the presence of halogens in aromatic rings may increase the solubility of a molecule.
2. Molecules with hydroxy groups or amino groups tend to have higher ESOL values compared to those without. For example, Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 has an ESOL value of -2.652, while CCCOC has an ESOL value of -0.688. This suggests that polar groups in molecules can increase solubility in water.
3. Molecules with long carbon chains or complex ring systems tend to have lower ESOL values compared to those with simpler structures. For example, CCCCCCC1CCCC1 has an ESOL value of -3.869, while Cc1cc(C)c(C)cc1C has an ESOL value of -3.664. This suggests that molecules with more complex structures may be less soluble in water.

================================

 To come up with rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict its ESOL value, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify common structural features or functional groups present in the molecules in the given dataset.
2. Analyze the solubility trends of the molecules based on their structural features or functional groups.
3. Use statistical analysis to identify correlations between the structural features/functional groups and the solubility values.
4. Develop a set of rules or guidelines that can be used to predict the ESOL value of a new molecule based on its structure or functional groups.
5. Validate the rules by testing them on a set of molecules not included in the original dataset.
Some possible rules that can be derived from the given dataset are:
1. Molecules with multiple chlorine substituents tend to have higher ESOL values, indicating lower solubility.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher ESOL values, indicating lower solubility.
3. Molecules with long hydrocarbon chains tend to have lower ESOL values, indicating higher solubility.
4. Molecules with amide groups tend to have lower ESOL values, indicating higher solubility.
5. Molecules with polar functional groups such as hydroxyl or carboxyl groups tend to have lower ESOL values, indicating higher solubility.
6. Molecules with unsaturated bonds tend to have lower ESOL values, indicating higher solubility.
7. Molecules with bulky or complex structures tend to have lower ESOL values, indicating higher solubility.

================================

 After analyzing the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the structure and properties of a molecule to its ESOL value:
1. The presence of halogens (especially chlorine) in a molecule increases its ESOL value. This is evident from the high ESOL values of molecules such as Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc12 and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl.
2. The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule also increases its ESOL value. Molecules like c1ccccc1C(O)c1ccccc1 and CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC12C3CCC4(O)C#C have high ESOL values due to the presence of aromatic rings in their structure.
3. The presence of certain functional groups such as amides, thiocarbonyls, and carboxylic acid esters can increase the ESOL value of a molecule. For example, the ESOL value of N#Cc1ccccc1 is high due to the presence of a carbonyl group, while the ESOL value of CN(C)C(=S)SSC(=S)N(C)C is high due to the presence of a thiocarbonyl group. Similarly, the ESOL value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 is high due to the presence of an ester group.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the ESOL value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., Cc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O) tend to have lower ESOL values compared to molecules without aromatic rings.
2. Molecules with chlorinated aromatic rings (e.g., c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2) tend to have higher ESOL values compared to molecules without chlorinated aromatic rings.
3. Molecules with polar functional groups such as carbamates, amides, and ureas (e.g., COC(=O)C, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1) tend to have lower ESOL values compared to molecules without these functional groups.

================================

 1. Molecules with Log Solubility in mols per litre greater than 0.5 generally have a hydrophilic functional group such as an amino group, hydroxy group, or carboxy group.
2. Molecules with Log Solubility in mols per litre less than -0.5 generally have a hydrophobic functional group such as an alkyl chain, aromatic ring, or a long carbon chain.
3. Molecules with Log Solubility in mols per litre between 0.5 and -0.5 often have a polar functional group, which can be either hydrophilic or hydrophobic depending on the rest of the molecule.

================================

 Here are three rules that can help predict molecules' ESOL values based on their structure/ properties:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings (especially those containing halogens) tend to have lower ESOL values than molecules without aromatic rings. This is because aromatic rings are relatively nonpolar and do not interact strongly with water molecules.
2. Molecules with long hydrocarbon chains (especially those containing multiple bonds) tend to have higher ESOL values than molecules with no or shorter hydrocarbon chains. This is because long hydrocarbon chains are more polar and can interact stronger with water molecules, leading to higher solubility.
3. Molecules with functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds (such as amines, alcohols, carboxylic acids, etc.) tend to have higher ESOL values than molecules without such groups. This is because these groups can interact strongly with water molecules through hydrogen bonding, leading to increased solubility.

================================

 Here are three possible rules to predict a molecule's ESOL value based on its structure and properties:
1. Molecules with multiple aromatic rings or conjugated systems tend to have higher ESOL values due to their potential for planar, delocalized π-electron systems.
2. Molecules with halogen atoms (especially chlorine) or other electronegative atoms tend to have higher ESOL values due to the strength of the polarity created by the atom's electrons.
3. Molecules with hydrophilic functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy, carboxy) tend to have lower ESOL values due to their affinity for water and solvation by polar molecules.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict molecules' ESOL values:
1. Molecules with halogenated aromatic rings tend to have lower ESOL values compared to those without. For example, Clc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has an ESOL value of -2.775, while Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1 has an ESOL value of -3.891. This suggests that the presence of halogenated aromatic rings in a molecule may decrease its solubility.
2. Molecules with multiple aromatic rings or large aromatic systems tend to have higher ESOL values compared to those with fewer or smaller ring systems. For example, Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3 has an ESOL value of -3.789, while C=CC#N has an ESOL value of -0.354. This suggests that the size and complexity of an aromatic system may increase a molecule's solubility.
3. Molecules with polar functional groups or extensive hydrogen bonding tend to have lower ESOL values compared to those without. For example, C=CC#N has an ESOL value of -0.354, while Nc1ccc2cc1ccccc2c1nnc(-c2cccc(C(F)(F)F)c2)o1 has an ESOL value of -4.029. This suggests that polar functional groups or hydrogen bonding may decrease a molecule's solubility.

================================

 Here are three possible rules to predict molecules' ESOL values based on their structures and properties:
1. Molecules with multiple halogens or aromatic rings tend to have lower ESOL values, as these functional groups can increase molecular weight and hydrophobicity, leading to reduced solubility in water.
2. Molecules with hydroxy or amino groups tend to have higher ESOL values, as these functional groups can increase polarity and hydrophilicity, leading to increased solubility in water.
3. Molecules with long, complex structures or multiple functional groups may have higher ESOL values, as these features can increase molecular size and complexity, leading to decreased solubility in water.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a high number of chlorine atoms tend to have a low solubility in water (ESOL value).
Example: Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, Oc2ccc1ncccc1c2, CCC(Br)(CC)C(=O)NC(N)=O.
Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic rings and halogens tend to have a low solubility in water (ESOL value).
Example: Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32, Clc1cccc(I)cc1.
Rule 3: Molecules with long and complex structures tend to have a low solubility in water (ESOL value).
Example: CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO.

================================

 Step-by-step rules to predict ESOL value based on molecular structure/properties:
1. Molecules with polar groups such as hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl, and thiol groups tend to have higher solubility and therefore lower ESOL values. For example, molecules with hydroxyl groups like alcohols or phenols tend to have lower ESOL values.
2. Molecules with bulky or complex structures tend to have lower solubility and therefore higher ESOL values. This is because such molecules often have steric hindrances that make it difficult for them to fit into the solvent molecules' lattice structure. Examples of such molecules include polymers or compounds with multiple ring systems.
3. Molecules with planar aromatic rings tend to have higher solubility and therefore lower ESOL values. This is because planar aromatic rings can form pi-pi interactions with solvent molecules, increasing the solubility of the molecule. Examples of such molecules include biphenyls, naphthalenes, and anthracenes.

================================

 1. Molecules with log solubility in mols per litre less than -4.5 are insoluble in water.
2. Molecules with log solubility in mols per litre greater than 4.5 are highly soluble in water.
3. Molecules with log solubility in mols per litre between 1 and 5 are moderately soluble in water.

================================

 To predict the ESOL value of a molecule, we can consider the following three rules based on the properties and structures of the molecule:
1. Molecules with conjugated systems or aromatic rings tend to have higher ESOL values due to their planar structure and delocalized pi-electrons. For example, naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene have high ESOL values.
2. Molecules with halogens or chlorine atoms tend to have higher ESOL values due to the polarity of these molecules. Halogenated compounds are more soluble in polar solvents, which increases their ESOL value. For example, DDT (1,1-bis(chlorophenyl)-2,2-diphenyl-ethane) has a high ESOL value.
3. Molecules with hydrogen bond donors or acceptors tend to have higher ESOL values due to the increased polarity and solubility. For example, amino acids and alcohols tend to have high ESOL values due to the presence of hydrogen bonding groups.
These rules can be used to predict the ESOL value of a molecule based on its chemical structure and properties. However, it is important to note that other factors such as the solvent used, temperature, and pressure can also affect the ESOL value of a molecule.

================================

 To come up with three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict its ESOL value, we can use the following approach:
1. Identify common functional groups or structural features present in the molecules in the given dataset.
2. Analyze the trends in the ESOL values of the molecules based on these functional groups or structural features.
3. Generate rules that explain how the presence or absence of these functional groups or structural features affects the ESOL value of a molecule.
Here are three rules that we can generate based on the given dataset:
1. Molecules with amide functional groups tend to have lower ESOL values than molecules without amide functional groups. This is because amide groups are relatively hydrophilic and can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, which increases the solubility of the molecule. For example, the ESOL value of Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1 is 0.051, while the ESOL value of c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2 is -4.685, which is much lower.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher ESOL values than molecules without aromatic rings. This is because aromatic rings are relatively hydrophobic and can formstacking interactions with water molecules, which increases the solubility of the molecule. For example, the ESOL value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is -3.802, while the ESOL value of ClCC#N is -0.448, which is much lower.
3. Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have lower ESOL values than molecules with fewer chlorine atoms. This is because chlorine is a relatively hydrophobic atom that can increase the lipophilicity of a molecule, resulting in lower solubility in water. For example, the ESOL value of Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c2 is -6.008, while the ESOL value of Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl is -4.546, which is much lower.
These rules can help predict the ESOL value

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the ESOL value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with a higher number of chlorine atoms tend to have a higher ESOL value. This can be seen in the case of Cc1cc(C)c2ccccc2c1C, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, and Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl which all have a high ESOL value due to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have a lower ESOL value than molecules without aromatic rings. This can be observed in the case of Cc1cc(C)c2ccccc2c1C which has a lower ESOL value than ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, even though the later has more chlorine atoms.
3. Molecules with hydroxyl or carboxyl groups tend to have a lower ESOL value than molecules without these groups. For example, CCOP(=S)(OCCO)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a lower ESOL value than CC1(C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O, even though both molecules contain aromatic rings. This is because the former has hydroxyl and carboxyl groups which decrease its solubility in water.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict molecules' ESOL values:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have lower ESOL values. This is evident from the presence of many aromatic compounds in the list, such as naphthalenes, biphenyls, and azobenzenes, which all have relatively low ESOL values.
2. Molecules with long carbon chains or branches tend to have lower ESOL values. This is evident from the presence of several fatty acids and their derivatives, such as lauric acid, palmitic acid, and oleic acid, which all have relatively low ESOL values.
3. Molecules with polar functional groups tend to have higher ESOL values. This is evident from the presence of many polar compounds in the list, such as amines, alcohols, carboxylic acids, and sulfones, which all have relatively high ESOL values. Additionally, molecules with multiple polar functional groups or a polar functional group at the end of a long carbon chain tend to have even higher ESOL values.

================================

 Here are three possible rules based on the given data:
1. Molecules with an aromatic ring or aromatic moiety tend to have a high ESOL value. For example, many polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have high ESOL values due to their aromatic structure.
2. Molecules with long carbon chains or complex structures tend to have lower ESOL values. For example, many pharmaceuticals have low ESOL values because they are often complex molecules with many different functional groups that make them less soluble in water.
3. Molecules with amide groups or other polar functional groups tend to have lower ESOL values. For example, many peptides and proteins have low ESOL values because they contain amide groups that can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, making them less soluble.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict molecules' ESOL values:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., benzene) tend to have lower ESOL values. This can be seen in many molecules such as CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1OC(C)C (-2.409), Nc1ccccc1 (-1.632), C1CCCCCC1 (-2.916), and Cc1ccccc1C (-3.004). The presence of an aromatic ring indicates a highly stable molecule, which is reflected in the lower ESOL value.
2. Molecules with multiple halogen atoms (such as chlorine and bromine) tend to have higher ESOL values. For example, Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (-6.709) and Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 (-5.270) have high ESOL values due to the presence of multiple halogen atoms. The presence of halogens increases the polarity of the molecule, which makes it less soluble in water and therefore has a higher ESOL value.
3. Molecules with amide groups (-NH2) or carbonyl groups (-C=O) tend to have lower ESOL values. This can be seen in molecules such as O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c2ccccc2 (-4.840), Cc1c[nH]c2ccccc12 (-2.981), and CCC(=O)OC (-0.984). Amide groups and carbonyl groups are often found in proteins and peptides, which are known for their low solubility in water. Therefore, molecules with these groups tend to have lower ESOL values.

================================

 Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict its ESOL value:
1. Molecules with halogens (chlorine, bromine, and iodine) tend to have lower ESOL values compared to molecules without halogens. This can be attributed to the fact that halogens have a tendency to increase the lipophilicity of a molecule, which in turn increases its solubility in fats and oils.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher ESOL values compared to molecules without aromatic rings. This is because aromatic rings are more polar than aliphatic rings and can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, increasing the solubility of the molecule in water.
3. Molecules with amide groups (-CONH-) tend to have lower ESOL values compared to molecules without amide groups. This is because amide groups can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, increasing the solubility of the molecule in water. Additionally, amide groups are more hydrophilic than other functional groups like esters (-COO-), which can also increase the solubility of a molecule in water.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict molecules' ESOL values:
1. Molecules with halogen atoms (especially bromine and chlorine) tend to have lower ESOL values. This is because halogens are hydrophobic and do not interact well with water molecules, making it less likely for the molecule to dissolve in water.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings and conjugated systems tend to have higher ESOL values. This is because aromatic rings and conjugated systems can form pi-pi interactions with water molecules, increasing the likelihood of the molecule dissolving in water.
3. Molecules with long carbon chains or complex structures tend to have lower ESOL values. This is because the increased molecular size and complexity can make it more difficult for the molecule to interact with water molecules, resulting in lower solubility.

================================

 Here are three possible rules based on the given data that can be used to predict the ESOL value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms in their structure tend to have high ESOL values. For example, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c2 and Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1 have high ESOL values.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings and double or triple bonds tend to have higher ESOL values. For example, Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 and C=CCC=C have high ESOL values.
3. Molecules with amide groups (-NH2) or carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) in their structure tend to have lower ESOL values. For example, COC(C)(C)CCCC(C)CC=CC(C)=CC(=O)OC(C)C and CCCCOCN(C(=O)CCl)c1c(CC)cccc1CC have lower ESOL values.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the ESOL value of a molecule:
1. Molecules with multiple halogen atoms tend to have higher ESOL values. For example, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl has an ESOL value of -7.261, while ClCC#N has an ESOL value of 0.152. This suggests that the presence of multiple halogen atoms increases the solubility of a molecule in water.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have lower ESOL values. For example, CCCCCC has an ESOL value of -2.261, while Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2 has an ESOL value of -2.613. This suggests that molecules with aromatic rings are less soluble in water than molecules without them.
3. Molecules with amide groups tend to have higher ESOL values. For example, CCCCCC(=O)OCC has an ESOL value of -2.962, while CCCC(C)(C)CO has an ESOL value of -1.027. This suggests that the presence of an amide group increases the solubility of a molecule in water.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data to predict the ESOL value of a molecule based on its structure and properties:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher ESOL values than molecules without aromatic rings. This is because aromatic rings are more hydrophobic and therefore less soluble in water. For example, compounds like CCCC(C)O, COC(C)(C)CCCC(C)CC=CC(C)=CC(=O)OC(C)C, and Cn1cnc2n(C)c(=O)n(C)c(=O)c12, which all contain aromatic rings, have higher ESOL values than compounds like CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O and C=CCCC=C, which do not.
2. Molecules with long carbon chains or complex ring systems tend to have lower ESOL values than molecules with simpler structures. This is because molecules with simpler structures are less likely to have hydrogen bonding or other interactions with water molecules, making them less soluble. For example, compounds like CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O and CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 have lower ESOL values than compounds like C=CCCC=C and CCCCCCC(=O)C, which have more complex structures.
3. Molecules with polar functional groups, such as hydroxyl groups or amino groups, tend to have higher ESOL values than molecules without these groups. This is because polar functional groups can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, making the molecule more soluble. For example, compounds like C=CC=O and C=CCCC=C have lower ESOL values than compounds like COc1ccc2ccccc2c1Cl and Cn1cnc2c1c(=O)[nH]c(=O)n2C, which have polar functional groups.

================================

 To come up with rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict molecules ESOL value, here are three possible steps:
1. Identify common functional groups or structural features present in the molecules in the provided list. For example, many molecules contain aromatic rings or halogens like chlorine or bromine.
2. Determine how these functional groups or structural features affect solubility based on chemical principles. For instance, aromatic rings tend to be more hydrophobic and therefore may increase the ESOL value (log solubility in mols per litre) if they are large or have substituents that make them more nonpolar.
3. Formulate rules that relate specific functional groups or structural features to changes in solubility based on patterns observed in the molecules in the list. These rules could be qualitative, such as "molecules with multiple aromatic rings or halogens tend to have higher ESOL values," or quantitative, such as "for every additional aromatic ring in a molecule, the ESOL value increases by 1 log unit."

================================

 Step 1: Identify common structural features among the molecules. For example, some molecules have aromatic rings, while others have chlorinated aromatic rings.
Step 2: Look for patterns in the solubility values. For instance, it appears that molecules with more chlorinated aromatic rings tend to have lower solubility values.
Step 3: Based on the identified patterns, formulate a rule that can be used to predict the solubility of new molecules. For example, if a molecule has multiple chlorinated aromatic rings, it is likely to have a low solubility value.

================================

 Step-by-step rules for predicting ESOL values based on molecular structure:
1. The presence of multiple halogens (chlorine, bromine, iodine) on aromatic rings increases the ESOL value due to the high solubility of these compounds in water.
2. The presence of multiple phenyl groups or aromatic rings in a molecule increases the ESOL value as these compounds have high solubility in water.
3. The presence of multiple functional groups such as amides, nitriles, and carboxylic acids also increases the ESOL value due to their polar nature and ability to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules.

================================
