 Here are three rules that can help predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects based on its structure/chemistry:
1. The presence of certain functional groups or structural features that are known to be associated with toxicity or side effects, such as heavy metals, halogens, epoxides, ethers, or certain aromatic moieties. For example, molecules with halogenated aromatics, such as in CCC1(C2=C(COC1=O)C(=O)N3CC4=C(C3=C2)N=C5C=CC(=C(C5=C4)CN(C)C)O)O 1, may be more likely to have adverse effects.
2. The presence of reactive groups or moieties that can react with biological molecules or tissues, such as unsaturated bonds, electrophilic centers, or groups that can form covalent bonds. These can lead to off-target effects, immune responses, or other toxicities. For example, molecules with highly reactive double or triple bonds, such as in C1=CC(=C(C=C1OC)N1CC2=C(C1=O)N=CC1=C(C=CC1=O)OCC2)O, may be more likely to have adverse effects.
3. The presence of certain molecular properties or features that are associated with increased toxicity, such as high molecular weight, hydrophobicity, positive charge, or instability. These can lead to issues with distribution, metabolism, or excretion, and may also increase the likelihood of off-target effects or immune responses. For example, molecules with high molecular weight or hydrophobicity, such as in [NH2-].Cl[Pt+2]Cl 1, may be more likely to have adverse effects.

1. Check for structural features that are known to be associated with toxicity, such as certain functional groups or ring systems. For example, certain aromatic amines, organic peroxides, and heavy metals are often associated with toxicity.
2. Look for evidence of pharmacological activity that could lead to adverse effects. Certain drugs may have desirable therapeutic effects but also unintended side effects. For example, anti-cancer drugs may also damage healthy cells.
3. Consider the route of administration and the intended use of the molecule. Some molecules may be more likely to cause adverse effects when administered intravenously rather than orally, or when used to treat a specific condition rather than being used as a general treatment.
