 1. Molecules with aromatic amines can cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders.
2. Molecules with organic molecular entity that contains a quinoline moiety can cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders.
3. Molecules with an aromatic ether that contains a benzene ring with an oxygen atom in the para position and an amino group in the meta position can cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with heavy atoms like iodine (I) or bromine (Br) are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with polar groups or charged moieties are more likely to cause adverse effects.

================================

 Based on the smiles strings provided, here are three rules that can be used to predict whether a molecule is likely to cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders:
1. A molecule with a planar, aromatic system with multiple rings fused together, such as in [1] or [2], is more likely to have adverse effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders. This is because such molecules often have a high degree of unsaturation, which can make them more reactive and prone to interacting with cellular targets in a harmful manner.
2. A molecule with a positively charged nitrogen atom, such as in [3] or [4], is more likely to have adverse effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders. This is because positively charged molecules tend to be more lipophilic and can easily cross cell membranes, where they can interact with intracellular targets and cause harm.
3. A molecule with multiple chlorine atoms, such as in [5] or [6], is more likely to have adverse effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders. This is because chlorine is an electronegative atom that can attract and complex with other molecules, and the presence of multiple chlorine atoms can increase the likelihood of such interactions occurring. Additionally, chlorinated molecules may also be more reactive and prone to undergoing chemical reactions that can lead to harmful products.

================================

 To create these rules, I would need to have a large set of chemicals and their corresponding side-effects. Then I would use machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and find patterns that relationship the structures of the molecules to their side effects. Here are some example rules that could be generated:
1. If a molecule contains a gold atom, it is likely to have significant side effects.
2. Molecules with long carbon chains and aromatic systems are more likely to cause reproductive system and breast disorders.
3. Molecules with thiol groups in their structure are more likely to have adverse effects.
4. Molecules with multiple amino acids or peptides are more likely to have side effects.
5. Molecules with a high number of stereocenters or chiral centers are more likely to have side effects.
6. Molecules with aromatic rings and halogens are more likely to cause adverse effects.
7. Molecules with a high number of rotatable bonds are more likely to have side effects.
8. Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors are more likely to have adverse effects.
These rules can be used as a starting point for predicting the side effects of new molecules. However, it's important to note that these rules are not foolproof and should be used in conjunction with other methods such as in vitro testing and clinical trials.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be used to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders based on its structure and properties:
1. The presence of an aromatic ring with an oxygen atom in the para position, which can mimic estrogen and interfere with hormonal balance, is a common feature of molecules that can cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders. Molecules with such structures should be carefully evaluated for their potential estrogenic activity.
2. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms or other heavy atoms in a molecule can indicate that it is a metabolite of a more complex molecule and may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects. These heavy atoms can also increase the molecular weight of the molecule, which can affect its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME).
3. The presence of reactive functional groups, such as aldehydes, ketones, acids, and epoxides, can indicate that a molecule is capable of forming covalent bonds with biological macromolecules, such as DNA and proteins. These covalent bonds can lead to the formation of toxic metabolites and can cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders.

================================

 Rule 1: A molecule with an aromatic ring or multiple conjugated bonds is more likely to have side-effects related to the reproductive system and/or breast disorders if the ring or bonds are not properly conjugated or substituted.
Rule 2: A molecule with a long, unbranched hydrocarbon chain, such as a fatty acid, is more likely to have side-effects related to the reproductive system and/or breast disorders if the chain is not properly conjugated or if it contains unsaturated bonds.
Rule 3: A molecule with a complex structure, such as a peptide or a natural product, is more likely to have side-effects related to the reproductive system and/or breast disorders if it contains amino acids or functional groups that are known to be associated with adverse effects.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be used to predict whether a molecule can cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders based on its structure and properties:
1. The presence of an aromatic ring system with a keto group in the para position to the phenolic hydroxy group can increase the likelihood of adverse effects. This is because such aromatic ketones can act as estrogen mimics, which can interfere with hormonal balance and lead to adverse effects. For example, the molecule labeled as "CC1=C(C=CC2=C1C(=NC(=N2)N)N)" contains an aromatic ketone and is therefore more likely to cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders.
2. The presence of multiple aromatic rings or aromatic ring systems with keto groups can also increase the likelihood of adverse effects. This is because such molecules can have a higher affinity for estrogen receptors, which can interfere with hormonal balance and lead to adverse effects. For example, the molecule labeled as "COC1=CC(=C(C=C2=C1C(=NC(=N2)N)N)OC)C(CNC(=O)CN)O" contains two aromatic ring systems with keto groups, making it more likely to cause adverse effects.
3. The presence of thiol groups can increase the likelihood of adverse effects. This is because thiol groups can react with oxidizing agents and form reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can cause damage to cells and tissues. For example, the molecule labeled as "C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O" contains a thiol group and is therefore more likely to cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders.

================================

 Based on the smiles string provided, here are three rules that can be used to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders:
1. A molecule that contains aromatic amines (Nc1ccccc1) or aromatic amides (C(=O)Nc1ccccc1) is likely to cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders. This is because these functional groups can act as hormone mimics or antagonists, which can interfere with endocrine function and lead to adverse effects.
2. A molecule that contains halogens (F, Cl, Br) in close proximity to an aromatic ring (within 3 bonds) is likely to cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders. This is because halogens can increase the electronegativity of the aromatic ring, which can alter its chemical reactivity and make it more prone to interfere with endocrine function.
3. A molecule that contains thiophene or its derivatives is likely to cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders. This is because thiophene and its derivatives can act as hormone mimics or antagonists, which can interfere with endocrine function and lead to adverse effects.
It's important to note that these rules are not definitive and should be used in conjunction with other methods of prediction and evaluation, such as in vitro assays and clinical trials. Additionally, the accuracy of these rules may vary depending on the specific chemical structure being evaluated.

================================

 1. A molecule with a negative ionizable group in close proximity to an aromatic ring is more likely to have side-effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders.
2. Molecules that contain the functional group NOS(=O)(=O)O are more likely to have side-effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders.
3. Molecules that contain the functional group [O-]C1=CC2=C(C=C(CO)C1)[C@@H](N2CCCC1=CC=CC=C1)C(=O)O are more likely to have side-effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders.

================================

 Rule 1: A molecule that contains a double bond in the presence of an oxygen atom is likely to cause adverse effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders.
Rule 2: A molecule that has aromatic rings and aromatic amines is likely to cause adverse effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders.
Rule 3: A molecule that contains aromatic rings and halogens is likely to cause adverse effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be used to predict whether a molecule is likely to cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders based on its structure and properties:
1. The presence of double or triple bonds in the molecule, especially if they are close together, may increase the likelihood of adverse effects. For example, the molecule labeled as "CC1(C2C(=C(N)[O-])C(=C(N)[O-])C(=O)C2(C(=O)C(O)=C2C=CC=C2)O1)O" in the data set contains multiple double bonds, which could contribute to its side-effect activity.
2. The presence of aromatic rings in the molecule, especially if they are large or highly substituted, may also increase the likelihood of adverse effects. For example, the molecule labeled as "C1CC2=C(C=CC=N2)Cl" in the data set contains an aromatic ring, which could contribute to its side-effect activity.
3. The presence of certain functional groups, such as nitro groups, ketones, acids, or amines, in the molecule may also increase the likelihood of adverse effects. For example, the molecule labeled as "C1CC2=C(C=CC=N2)Cl" in the data set contains a ketone group, which could contribute to its side-effect activity.

================================

 Rule 1: A molecule is considered to have side effects related to the reproductive system and/or breast disorders if it has a structure that contains aromatic ring(s) with an oxo substituent(s) at the para-position(s).
Example: C[C@@H](C(=O)OC(C)C)NP(=O)(OC[C@@H]1[C@H](C([C@@H](O1)N2C=NC3=C2N=C(N=C3N)Cl)OCOC)[C@@H](O)[C@@H]1C[C@H](OC)[C@H](C)[C@@H](OCCOCCNC(=O)CC(=O)O)O1)OC3=CC=CC=C3C2=N[C@@H]1C(C)=O.
Rule 2: A molecule is considered to have side effects related to the reproductive system and/or breast disorders if it has a structure that contains aromatic ring(s) with an oxo substituent(s) at the meta-position(s) and/or has a five-membered lactam ring with at least one aromatic substituent.
Example: C1=CC=C(C=C1)N(CC2=NCCN2)C2=CC(=CC=C2)O.
Rule 3: A molecule is considered to have side effects related to the reproductive system and/or breast disorders if it has a structure that contains an organic heterotricyclic compound such as an organic heterobicyclic compound or an organic heterotetracyclic compound with at least one aromatic substituent and at least one oxo substituent.
Example: CCOC(=O)C1=CN=C(C=C1)C#CC2=CC3=C(C=C3)SCCC21C(=O)OCC1(C)C(C)=O.

================================

 As a Chemist, I can identify some patterns in these molecules that may be related to their potential for causing adverse effects. Here are three rules that can help predict if a molecule is likely to cause such effects:
1. The presence of aromatic rings: Molecules containing aromatic rings have been observed to have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects. This is because aromatic rings can interfere with hormonal balance and other critical biological processes.
2. The presence of double bonds: Molecules containing multiple double bonds have also been observed to increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects. This is because such bonds can lead to the formation of reactive species that can cause damage to cells and tissues.
3. The presence of polar functional groups: Molecules that have polar functional groups, such as alcohols or carboxylic acids, are more likely to cause adverse effects. This is because these groups can interact with biological systems in unpredictable ways, leading to unintended consequences.
It's important to note that these rules are not absolute and should be used with caution. Other factors, such as the overall structure of the molecule and its interactions with specific receptors, can also play a role in determining its potential for causing adverse effects. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of a molecule's properties and structure is necessary to make accurate predictions about its potential for causing adverse effects.

================================

 Here are three potential rules to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders based on its structure:
1. A molecule with multiple aromatic rings or double bonds in its structure is more likely to have adverse effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders. This is because such molecules tend to be more chemically reactive and can interfere with hormonal balance or other biological processes.
2. A molecule with a high number of heavy atoms (such as metals) or aromatic rings is more likely to have adverse effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders. This is because such molecules tend to be more accumulative and can cause long-term toxic effects.
3. A molecule with a high number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors is more likely to have adverse effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders. This is because such molecules tend to be more polar and can interact with various biological targets, potentially causing unintended side effects.

================================

 Rule 1: A molecule with a heavy metal core (e.g. platinum, gadolinium) is more likely to have adverse effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders.
Rule 2: Molecules with aromatic ring systems or unsaturated bonds in their structure, such as those containing benzene or ethene, are more likely to have adverse effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders.
Rule 3: Molecules with a high degree of overall charge, such as those containing multiple anionic or cationic groups, are more likely to have adverse effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders.

================================

 To infer rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is capable of causing adverse effects, we can analyze the smiles strings provided in the dataset and look for patterns or features that are common among the molecules that are labeled as 1 (related to side-effect activity) and those that are labeled as 0 (not related). Here are three possible rules that can be inferred from the dataset:
1. The presence of halogen atoms (especially chlorine) in the molecule seems to be a common feature among the molecules labeled as 1. For example, many of the molecules labeled as 1 have chlorine atoms in their structure, such as [CH2]CC=O, CCC(=O)OCC(=O)C1(CCC2C1(CC(C3C2CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC43C)O)C)OC(=O)OCC, and CCC(C)C(=O)OC1CC(C=C2C1C(=O)OC)OC. This suggests that the presence of halogen atoms, especially chlorine, may be a risk factor for adverse effects.
2. The presence of multiple aromatic rings in the molecule also seems to be a common feature among the molecules labeled as 1. For example, many of the molecules labeled as 1 have multiple aromatic rings in their structure, such as C[C@H](C(=O)N)NC(=O)[C@@H]1CCCN1C(=O)[C@H](CCCN=C(N)N)NC(=O)[C@H](CC(C)C)NC(=O)[C@@H](CC3=CN=CC=C3)NC(=O)[C@@H](CC4=CC=C(C=C4)Cl)NC(=O)[C@@H](CC5=CC6=CC=CC=C6C=C5)NC(=O)C, and C1C(=C(N2C(S1)C(C2=O)NC(=O)C(C3=CC=CC=C3)N)C(=O)O)Cl 1. This suggests that the presence of multiple aromatic rings may increase the likelihood

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is capable of causing adverse effects:
1. Presence of halogenated aromatic rings or polysubstituted aromatic systems in a molecule can lead to adverse effects such as carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and endocrine disruption. For example, the molecule C=CCN, which contains an aromatic ring with chlorine substituents, has been found to have adverse effects on the reproductive system and breasts.
2. The presence of multiple aromatic rings linked by conjugated double bonds (such as in the case of C=CCN, C=CCN, and C1=CC=CC=C1) can lead to adverse effects such as allergic reactions and toxicity due to reactive oxygen species generation.
3. The presence of peptide linkages between amino acids can lead to adverse effects such as anaphylactic shock and immunogenicity. For example, the molecule C(CC(=O)O)CN=C(N)N contains a peptide bond between glycine and lysine residues, which can cause adverse effects on the immune system.

================================

 It is important to note that this is a complex task and coming up with rules that directly relate the structure of a molecule to its adverse effects can be challenging. It requires expertise in medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology. However, here are three possible rules that can be used as a starting point to predict whether a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. The presence of reactive functional groups: Molecules that contain reactive functional groups such as epoxides, carbonyls, and alcohols are more likely to cause adverse effects. These groups can react with biological molecules and lead to toxic responses. For example, molecules with epoxide groups can alkylate DNA and cause genotoxicity.
2. The presence of known toxic moieties: Certain moieties are known to be toxic and should be avoided in drug development. For example, heavy metals like mercury and lead are known to be toxic, and their presence in a molecule can lead to significant adverse effects. Similarly, molecules with aromatic amines can cause hepatotoxicity due to their ability to form reactive intermediates.
3. The presence of structural alerts: There are specific structural features that are known to be associated with adverse effects. These are called structural alerts, and they can be used to identify potentially toxic molecules. For example, the presence of long carbon chains or multiple aromatic rings can increase the lipophilicity of a molecule, leading to accumulation in tissues and potential toxicity.
It's important to note that these rules are not definitive and should be used with caution. Other factors such as the dosage, route of administration, and individual susceptibility can also influence the safety of a molecule. Therefore, it's important to conduct thorough preclinical and clinical testing to ensure the safety of a molecule before it is approved for use.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with reproductive system and/or breast disorder side effects often contain unsaturated six-membered rings with at least one halogen substituent and at least one nitrogen atom in the ring.
Rule 2: Molecules with reproductive system and/or breast disorder side effects often contain unsaturated six-membered rings with at least one halogen substituent and at least one nitrogen atom outside the ring, connected to the ring by a carbon-carbon bond.
Rule 3: Molecules with reproductive system and/or breast disorder side effects often contain phosphorus-containing groups, such as phosphine oxides or phosphinates, in their structure.

================================

 Rule 1: The molecule can cause adverse effects if it has an aromatic ring with an o-hydroxy substituent and an azo group.
Example: CC1=CC=C(C=C1)N=Nc1ccc(O)c(O)c1.
Rule 2: The molecule can cause adverse effects if it has an aromatic ring with a keto group and an amino group.
Example: C=CC(N)=C(C)C.
Rule 3: The molecule can cause adverse effects if it has a thiol group and an aromatic ring.
Example: CSc1ccccc1.

================================

 Based on the provided information, here are three rules that can help predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects:
1. A molecule with a structure similar to a known reproductive or breast disorder causing agent is more likely to have adverse effects on these systems.
2. Molecules with multiple negative charges or aromatic systems with delocalized electrons are more likely to have adverse effects.
3. Molecules with uncommon or rare structural features are more likely to have adverse effects due to their novelty and potential for unexpected interactions with biological systems.

================================

 Based on your description, the smiles strings labeled as 1 are related to side effects involving the reproductive system and breasts, while those labeled as 0 are not. To infer rules that directly relate the structure and properties of a molecule to its potential for causing adverse effects, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify common structural features in the molecules with the 1 label.
2. Look for patterns or trends in the properties of these molecules, such as charge, size, functional groups, or aromaticity.
3. Use this information to develop a set of criteria or rules that can be used to predict whether other molecules are likely to have adverse effects.
Here are three possible rules that could be inferred based on the given data:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds close to the reproductive system or breasts may be more likely to cause side effects. For example, molecule 1 has a double bond and an aromatic ring that are close to the reproductive system and breasts, which may explain why it is related to side effects in this area.
2. Molecules with certain functional groups or patterns of charge distribution may be more likely to cause side effects. For example, molecule 1 has a negatively charged carboxylate group and a positively charged amino group, which may contribute to its ability to cause adverse effects.
3. Molecules that are large or have complex structures may be more likely to cause side effects. This is because they may have more potential interactions with biological systems, leading to unintended consequences. For example, molecule 1 is relatively large and complex, which may explain why it is related to side effects.

================================

 There are many different ways to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects. Here are three rules based on the chemical structure:
1. The molecule should contain functional groups or structural features that are known to be associated with toxicity or side effects, such as aromatic rings, ethers, ketones, esters, or certain types of heterocyclic compounds. For example, molecules with benzene ring or aromatic ether groups are more likely to have adverse effects.
2. The molecule should have a high lipophilicity or drug-like properties (e.g., logP value), which can lead to accumulation in tissues and organs and increased risk of toxicity. Molecules with long half-lives or high bioavailability are more likely to cause adverse effects.
3. The molecule should have structural similarity to known toxicants or compounds with established safety data. If a molecule is structurally similar to a compound already known to cause adverse effects, there is a higher chance that it also may be toxic. This can be assessed using machine learning algorithms or chemical similarity analysis.
It is important to note that these rules are not definitive and do not ensure prediction of all possible adverse effects. Additional information, such as results from in vitro or in vivo assays, can help refine the prediction and ensure safety of a molecule.

================================

 1. A molecule with an aromatic ring that is substituted with an alkyl group and a carbonyl group and is in close proximity to an oxygen atom is more likely to cause adverse effects.
2. A molecule with a nitrogen-containing functional group, such as an amine or an imine, is more likely to cause adverse effects.
3. A molecule with a five-membered heterocyclic ring containing an oxygen atom is more likely to cause adverse effects.

================================

 RULE 1: The molecule has an aromatic ring with an ethyl ester group attached to it.

RULE 2: The molecule has an aromatic ring with an amide group attached to it.

RULE 3: The molecule has an aromatic ring with a carboxylic acid group attached to it.

================================

 Sure, here are three rules that can help predict if a molecule is capable of causing adverse effects based on its structure/properties:
1. The presence of certain functional groups or structural features that are known to be associated with toxicity or side effects, such as those containing heavy metals, halogens, or aromatic rings.
2. The molecular weight and lipophilicity of a molecule, which can affect its ability to penetrate cell membranes and interact with critical biological targets. Molecules with high lipophilicity or molecular weight may be more likely to cause adverse effects.
3. The presence of formal charges or ionizable groups in a molecule, which can affect its solubility, reactivity, and ability to interact with other molecules or biological systems. Molecules with high formal charges or ionizable groups may be more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 2: Molecules with bulky or complex structures are more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with positive charges are more likely to cause adverse effects due to their interactions with negatively charged cellular components.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be used to predict if a molecule will cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders based on its chemical structure:
1. The presence of aromatic rings with halogen substituents in the molecule can increase the likelihood of adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders. For example, molecules with chlorine or fluorine substituents on aromatic rings have been associated with increased risk of reproductive and breast disorders.
2. The presence of double or triple bonds in the molecule can also increase the likelihood of adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders. Molecules with multiple conjugated double bonds or triple bonds can have heightened reactivity and can potentially interfere with hormonal signaling pathways.
3. The molecule's overall size and complexity can also influence its potential to cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders. Larger, more complex molecules with multiple functional groups can have a higher likelihood of interacting with hormonal systems in the body and causing adverse effects.

3. The presence of halogens: Molecules with halogen atoms, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, are more likely to have adverse effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders. Halogens can interfere with hormonal balance and disrupt endocrine function.
These rules are not definitive and should be used with caution. It's important to note that other factors, such as the molecule's size, charge, and hydrophobicity, can also contribute to its potential for adverse effects. It's always best to consult with a qualified chemist or toxicity expert when evaluating the safety of a molecule.

1. The molecule has a structure that contains aromatic amines or aromatic amide groups, as seen in many of the compounds listed in the dataset, such as [Y], C1(N=C(N=C(N1OCCCOC2=CC(=C(C=C2Cl)Cl)Cl)N)N)C, and C(C(CO)O)O.

3. Molecules that are positively charged (like in C[N+](C)(C)CCCCCCNCC=C) or have an overall positive charge (like in [C-]#N.[C-]#N.[C-]#N.[C-]#N.[C-]#N.[C-]#N.[Fe+2]) are more likely to cause adverse effects.

================================

 Rule 1: A molecule with a side-effect label of 1 is likely to be associated with a reproductive system or breast disorder if it has a structure that contains a double bond between a carbonyl and a nitrogen atom (C=C1C(=O)N(C2=CC=CC=C2)C1=O). For example, [C-]#N.[C-]#N.[C-]#N.[C-]#N.[C-]#N.[N-]=O.
Rule 2: A molecule with a side-effect label of 1 is likely to be associated with a reproductive system or breast disorder if it has a structure that contains an aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent (Cl) attached to it (C1=C(Cl)C=C(C2=CC=CC=C2)C1=O). For example, CC1=CN=C(C(=C1OC)C)CS(=O)C2=NC3=C(N2)C=C(C=C3)OC.
Rule 3: A molecule with a side-effect label of 1 is likely to be associated with a reproductive system or breast disorder if it has a structure that contains a ring assembly with multiple double bonds (C1=CC=C2C=C(C=C2C1=O)C1=CC=C2C=C(C=C2C1=O)C1=CC=C2C=C(C=C2C1=O)C1=CC=C2C=C(C=C2C1=O)C1=CC=C2C=C(C=C2C1=O)C1=CC=C2C=C(C=C2C1=O)C1=CC=C2C=C(C=C2C1=O)C1=CC=C2C=C(C=C2C1=O)C1=CC=C2C=C(C=C2C1=O)C1=CC=C2C=C(C=C2C1=O)C1=CC=C2C=C(C=C2C1=O)C1=CC=C2C=C(C=C2C1=O)C1=CC=C2C=C(C=C2C1=O)C1=

================================

 Sure! Here are three possible rules based on the given data that could help predict if a molecule is capable of causing adverse effects related to the reproductive system and/or breast disorders:
1. The presence of a double bond between a carbonyl carbon and a ring nitrogen in the molecule (e.g., C=C1C(=O)Nc2ccccc21) is a potential indicator of a molecule that can cause adverse effects. This structural feature has been observed in several molecules in the data set that are known to cause such effects, such as CC1=CC(=C(C=C1)O)C(CCN(C(C)C)C(C)C)C2=CC=CC=C2.
2. The presence of multiple aromatic rings in the molecule (e.g., C1=CC=C(C=C1)OC) could be an indicator of a molecule that is capable of causing adverse effects. This structural feature has been observed in several molecules in the data set that are known to cause such effects, such as C1=CC=C(C=C1)OC.
3. The presence of a negatively charged moiety, such as a carboxylate group or a sulfate group, in the molecule (e.g., COCC1=C(N2C(C(C2=O)NC(=O)C(=NOC)C3=CSC(=N3)N)SC1)C(=O)O) could indicate that the molecule is capable of causing adverse effects. This structural feature has been observed in several molecules in the data set that are known to cause such effects, such as CS(=O)(=O)O.
It's important to note that these rules are based on a limited set of data and may not be applicable to all molecules. Additionally, other factors such as the molecule's concentration, route of administration, and duration of exposure can also influence whether a molecule causes adverse effects. Therefore, it's important to consider all available information when evaluating the potential risks associated with a given molecule.

================================

 Rules for predicting adverse effects based on molecular structure:

1. Presence of halogens in the molecule can lead to adverse effects.
2. Presence of multiple aromatic rings in the molecule can lead to adverse effects.
3. Presence of multiple double bonds in the molecule can lead to adverse effects.
4. Presence of multiple cycles in the molecule can lead to adverse effects.
5. Presence of certain functional groups such as amines, carboxylic acids, alcohols, and ethers can lead to adverse effects.
6. Presence of certain heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and arsenic can lead to adverse effects.
7. Presence of certain radioactive compounds can lead to adverse effects.
8. Presence of certain organic compounds such as formaldehyde and benzene can lead to adverse effects.
9. Presence of multiple chlorines in the molecule can lead to adverse effects.
10. Presence of multiple nitrogens in the molecule can lead to adverse effects.

================================

 The three rules to predict whether a molecule can cause adverse effects are:
1. A molecule that contains functional groups or structural features associated with known toxicants is more likely to cause adverse effects. Examples of such functional groups or structural features include thiocarbonyls, aromatic amines, aromatic ketones, acrylamides, and halogens.
2. A molecule that has a high lipophilicity or druglikeness score is more likely to cause adverse effects. Lipophilic molecules tend to accumulate in tissues and can cause toxicity by interfering with cellular processes. Druglikeness score is a measure of how closely a molecule resembles known drugs and can be used as a proxy for its potential toxicity.
3. A molecule that exhibits promiscuity, i.e., binds to multiple targets or pathways, is more likely to cause adverse effects. Promiscuous molecules can interact with biological systems in unintended ways, leading to off-target toxicity.

================================

 Rule 1: A molecule that contains a basic amino group in its structure is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: A molecule with an aromatic ring and at least one double bond in its structure is more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: A molecule with a long and complex structure that contains multiple functional groups is more likely to cause adverse effects.

================================

 The rules to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects are as follows:
1. If a molecule has a side-effect related smiles string label of 1, it is likely to cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders.
2. If a molecule has an organic molecular entity smiles string with a silver atom in the central position, it is likely to have antimicrobial properties.
3. If a molecule contains a [Ag] moiety, it is likely to have antimicrobial properties.
Note: These rules are based on the given data and may not be applicable to all molecules.

================================

 Rule 1: A molecule is likely to have side-effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders if it has a structure that contains a benzene ring fused to a pyridine ring, with a chlorine atom attached to the pyridine ring.
Rule 2: A molecule is likely to have side-effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders if it has a structure that contains a nitrogen heterocyclic ring fused to an organic heterocyclic ring, with an oxygen atom attached to the nitrogen atom.
Rule 3: A molecule is likely to have side-effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders if it has a structure that contains an aromatic ring system with multiple double bonds and a nitrogen atom attached to one of the carbon atoms adjacent to the double bonds.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with aromatic amines can cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules with organic molecules containing a carbonyl group can cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with organic molecules containing a chelating agent can cause adverse effects.

================================

 As a Chemist, I would infer the following 3 rules to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects based on its structure or properties:
1. Molecules with phosphoramidate groups (F1) or organic phosphonates (F2) in their structure are likely to cause adverse effects, as they can interfere with cellular processes and disrupt homeostasis.
2. Molecules with aromatic amines (N1) or tertiary amino groups (N2) in their structure can cause adverse effects, as these groups can be metabolized into carcinogenic compounds that damage DNA and promote tumor growth.
3. Molecules with metal complexes, such as gold (Au), gadolinium (Gd), or lanthanum (La), in their structure can cause adverse effects, as these metals can accumulate in organs and tissues, leading to toxic effects and organ dysfunction.

================================

 Rule 1: Molecules with a side-effect label of 1 have a structure that includes a nitrogen mustard group, a fluorine atom, or an organic heterotricyclic compound such as an organoarsenic or organic sulfide.
Rule 2: Molecules with a side-effect label of 1 have a structure that includes a quinoline or quinolone ring system, an aromatic amine, an aromatic ether, an aromatic ketone, or an aromatic hydrocarbon.
Rule 3: Molecules with a side-effect label of 1 have a structure that includes a member of the class of benzenes substituted with nitrogenous functional groups such as amino, amide, or carboxamide groups, or aromatic rings fused to aromatic heterocycles such as quinolines, isoquinolines, or pyridines.

================================

 Here are three rules that can be used to predict if a molecule can cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders based on its structure:
1. A molecule with a structure containing a substituted aniline moiety may be more likely to cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders if it has an electron-withdrawing group such as chloride or fluoride on the aniline ring. This is because such groups can increase the tendency of the molecule to bind to estrogen receptors, which can lead to an increase in estrogen-like activity and potentially cause adverse effects.
2. A molecule with a structure containing aromatic ring systems with double bonds in a fashion similar to the steroid double bond system (e.g., aromatic rings connected by ethylene or other double bonds) may be more likely to cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders if it has multiple aromatic rings in a linear arrangement. This is because such molecules can mimic the shape and behavior of natural steroid hormones, which can cause adverse effects by binding to steroid hormone receptors and triggering signaling pathways.
3. A molecule with a structure containing a heterocyclic ring system (e.g., thiophene, pyridine, or pyrimidine) may be more likely to cause adverse effects related to the reproductive system and breast disorders if it has a high degree of unsaturation (e.g., multiple double bonds) in the ring system. This is because such molecules can have a high affinity for estrogen receptors and other signaling proteins, which can lead to estrogen-like activity and potentially cause adverse effects.

================================

 Here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it can cause adverse effects:
1. The presence of halogens, particularly chlorine, in a molecule can increase its reactivity and potentially lead to adverse effects. For example, molecules like CCOCCP(CCOCC)CCP(CCOCC)CCOCC and CN(CC=C1C=CC=C1)CC2=CC=CC3=CC=CC=C32 often contain multiple chlorine atoms, which can increase their reactivity and potentially cause adverse effects.
2. Molecules with aromatic rings or double bonds can be more reactive and potentially cause adverse effects. For example, molecules like C1=CC2=C(C=C1OC(F)(F)F)SC(=N2)N and C1=CC(=C(C=C1N)C(=O)O)O1 often contain aromatic rings or double bonds, which can increase their reactivity and potentially cause adverse effects.
3. The presence of certain functional groups, such as amines, carboxylic acids, and alcohols, can also indicate a higher likelihood of adverse effects. For example, molecules like CCOCCP(CCOCC)CCP(CCOCC)CCOCC and CN1C2=C(C=C(C=C2)Cl)C(=NC(C1=O)O)C3=CC=CC=C3Cl often contain amine functional groups, which can increase their reactivity and potentially cause adverse effects.
