Based on the given data, it can be inferred that the epsilon LUMO value of a molecule depends on its structure and chemical properties. To come up with three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value, we need to analyze the data in more detail.

Firstly, we notice that there are several types of functional groups present in the molecules, such as carboxylic acids, amines, nitriles, and carbonyls. These functional groups have different electronic properties and may affect the epsilon LUMO value of the molecule. For example, carboxylic acids tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values than amines or nitriles.

Secondly, we observe that the number of atoms in the molecule also affects the epsilon LUMO value. Generally, larger molecules tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values than smaller ones. This is because larger molecules have more electrons and thus a higher probability of having unpaired electrons, which contribute to the epsilon LUMO value.

Thirdly, we notice that the position of functional groups and atoms in the molecule also affects the epsilon LUMO value. For example, carboxylic acids with a carboxyl group at the end of the chain tend to have lower epsilon LUMO values than those with a carboxyl group in the middle of the chain. Similarly, nitriles with a
