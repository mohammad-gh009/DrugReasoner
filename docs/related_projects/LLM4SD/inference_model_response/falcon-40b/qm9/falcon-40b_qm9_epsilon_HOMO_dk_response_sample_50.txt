Based on the given data, it can be inferred that the HOMO values of molecules are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups such as carbonyls, amines, and nitrogens. Therefore, three rules can be proposed to directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon HOMO value:

1. Presence of carbonyls: Molecules containing carbonyls tend to have lower HOMO values than those without them. This is because carbonyls are electron-withdrawing groups that destabilize the conjugated system of the molecule, leading to a decrease in its HOMO energy level.

2. Presence of amines: Molecules containing amines tend to have higher HOMO values than those without them. This is because amines are electron-donating groups that stabilize the conjugated system of the molecule, leading to an increase in its HOMO energy level.

3. Presence of nitrogens: Molecules containing nitrogens tend to have higher HOMO values than those without them. This is because nitrogens are electronegative atoms that can form strong bonds with other atoms, leading to a stabilization of the conjugated system of the molecule and an increase in its HOMO energy level.

These rules can be further refined based on additional data or analysis, but they provide a starting point for predicting the HOMO values of molecules based on their structure and functional groups.
