To come up with three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict its lipophilicity, some possible considerations could be:

1. Polar groups: Molecules with polar groups such as amines, carboxylic acids, and esters tend to have lower lipophilicity than nonpolar molecules. This is because polar groups can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, which reduces their ability to dissolve in lipids.

2. Number of hydrogen bonds: Molecules with more hydrogen bonds tend to have higher lipophilicity than those with fewer hydrogen bonds. This is because hydrogen bonds are formed between polar groups and water molecules, which increases the molecule's ability to dissolve in lipids.

3. Size and shape: Larger and more complex molecules tend to have lower lipophilicity than smaller and simpler ones. This is because larger molecules have more surface area for polar groups to interact with water molecules, reducing their ability to dissolve in lipids.

4. Hydrophobic interactions: Molecules with hydrophobic groups tend to have higher lipophilicity than those with hydrophilic groups. This is because hydrophobic groups repel water molecules, allowing them to dissolve in lipids more easily.

Overall, these four factors can be used to develop three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict its lipophilicity.
