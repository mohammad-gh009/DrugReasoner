Step 3: Use machine learning algorithms to develop classification models that can accurately predict whether a given molecule is likely to cause adverse effects based on its structure and functional groups. This can involve training the model on a large dataset of known toxic and non-toxic molecules, and then testing its performance on new compounds.

Step 4: Refine the classification models by incorporating additional data and refining the feature selection process. This can involve using techniques such as feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and cross-validation to ensure that the models are robust and accurate.

Step 5: Validate the classification models on independent datasets to ensure that they generalize well and can accurately predict the toxicity of new compounds. This can involve testing the models on different types of molecules, including those with different functional groups and structures.

Overall, the goal is to develop a set of rules that can be used to quickly and accurately assess the potential toxicity of new compounds based on their chemical structure and functional groups.
