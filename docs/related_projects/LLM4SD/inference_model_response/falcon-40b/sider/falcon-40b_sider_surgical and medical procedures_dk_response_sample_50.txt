1. Identify patterns in the data: Look for commonalities among the molecules that have been labeled as causing adverse effects. For example, do they all contain certain functional groups or structural features? Are there any trends in their chemical properties or structures?

Based on the given data, we can infer that there are three main factors that contribute to the side effects of a molecule:

1. The presence of certain functional groups or chemical structures in the molecule. For example, molecules containing halogens (such as chlorine), amines, sulfonamides, and carboxylic acids tend to have more side effects than those without these groups.

2. The pharmacological activity of the molecule. Molecules that interact with specific receptors or enzymes in the body are more likely to have side effects than those that do not.

3. The dose and duration of exposure to the molecule. High doses or prolonged exposure to a molecule can increase the likelihood of side effects.

Based on these factors, we can develop three rules to predict whether a molecule will have side effects:

Rule 1: If a molecule contains certain functional groups or chemical structures (such as halogens, amines, sulfonamides, or carboxylic acids), it is more likely to have side effects.

Rule 2: If a molecule interacts with specific receptors or enzymes in the body, it is more likely to have side effects.

Rule 3: If a molecule is administered at high doses or for prolonged periods of time, it is more likely to have side effects.
