Based on the given data, we can infer that molecules that have a certain structure or property may be more likely to cause adverse effects. Here are three rules that can be derived from the data:

1. Molecules with a high number of oxygen atoms in their structure are more likely to cause adverse effects. This is because oxygen is highly reactive and can form free radicals that can damage cells and tissues.
