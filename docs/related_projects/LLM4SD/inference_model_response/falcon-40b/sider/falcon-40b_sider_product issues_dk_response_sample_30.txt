Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is likely to cause adverse effects:

1. If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
2. If a molecule contains a chlorine atom in its structure, it is less likely to cause adverse effects.
3. If a molecule contains a sulfur atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.

These rules are based on the observation that molecules containing nitrogen atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects than those without, while molecules containing chlorine atoms are less likely to cause adverse effects than those without. Additionally, molecules containing sulfur atoms are more likely to cause adverse effects than those without. However, it is important to note that these rules may not always hold true and should be used in conjunction with other factors when assessing the potential for a molecule to cause adverse effects.
