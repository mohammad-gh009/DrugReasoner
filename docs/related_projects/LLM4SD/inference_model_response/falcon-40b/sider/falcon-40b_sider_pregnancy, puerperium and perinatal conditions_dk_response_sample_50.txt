Rule 1: Molecules with a high number of nitrogen atoms in their structure are more likely to cause adverse effects. This rule is supported by the fact that all molecules labeled as causing adverse effects have at least one nitrogen atom in their structure, while none of the molecules labeled as not causing adverse effects have any nitrogen atoms.

Rule 2: Molecules with a high number of carbon atoms in their structure are less likely to cause adverse effects. This rule is supported by the fact that all molecules labeled as causing adverse effects have at least 20 carbon atoms in their structure, while none of the molecules labeled as not causing adverse effects have more than 19 carbon atoms.

Based on the given data, we can infer three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is likely to cause adverse effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions:

1. Molecules with a high number of aromatic rings or heterocyclic rings are more likely to cause adverse effects.
2. Molecules with a high number of polar functional groups, such as carboxylic acids, amines, and esters, are more likely to cause adverse effects.
3. Molecules with a high number of halogen atoms, especially fluorine, chlorine, and bromine, are more likely to cause adverse effects.

These rules can be further refined based on additional data and analysis.
