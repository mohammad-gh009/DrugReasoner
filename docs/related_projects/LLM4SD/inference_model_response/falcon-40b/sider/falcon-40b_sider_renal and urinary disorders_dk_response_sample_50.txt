1. The first step in inferring the rules is to identify the relevant features or properties of the molecules that are related to their renal and urinary activity. This can be done by examining the chemical structures of the molecules and identifying any common patterns or functional groups that may be responsible for their activity.

We can then use these features to train the models and generate the rules that directly relate them to the activity of the molecules.

2. The second step is to use machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, logistic regression, or neural networks to train a model on the labeled data. This involves selecting the appropriate algorithm based on the nature of the problem and the available data, and then tuning the parameters of the model to achieve the desired level of accuracy.

3. The third step is to evaluate the performance of the model using cross-validation techniques such as k-fold cross-validation or leave-one-out cross-validation. This involves splitting the data into multiple subsets, training the model on each subset, and evaluating its performance on the remaining subset. The process is repeated multiple times until all subsets have been used for testing.

4. Finally, the rules can be extracted from the trained model by examining the patterns of activation of the neurons in the final layer of the neural network. These patterns represent the features that are most important for predicting the class labels, and can be used to formulate the rules.
