Based on the given data, we can infer that molecules that have a side-effect activity related to injury, poisoning, and procedural complications tend to have certain structural features or properties. Here are three rules that can be used to predict whether a molecule has such activity:

1. If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, it is more likely to have a side-effect activity.

The task requires the chemist to infer three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it can cause adverse effects. The chemist should consider the following steps:

1. Analyze the data: The chemist should carefully analyze the data provided in the instruction. They should examine the structures of the molecules and their labels to understand the relationship between the structure and the label.

2. Identify patterns: The chemist should identify any patterns or trends in the data that may help them infer the rules. For example, they may notice that certain functional groups or structural features are more likely to be associated with adverse effects than others.

3. Develop rules: Based on the analysis and identification of patterns, the chemist should develop three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it can cause adverse effects. These rules should be clear, concise, and easy to apply to new molecules.

4. Test the rules: The chemist should test the rules on a set of molecules that were not included in the original data to ensure that they are accurate and generalizable. If necessary, they may need to refine the rules based on the results of this testing.

5. Communicate the rules: Once the chemist has developed and tested the rules, they should communicate them clearly and concisely to other chemists and stakeholders who may benefit from them. This communication should include examples of how the rules can be applied to new molecules.
