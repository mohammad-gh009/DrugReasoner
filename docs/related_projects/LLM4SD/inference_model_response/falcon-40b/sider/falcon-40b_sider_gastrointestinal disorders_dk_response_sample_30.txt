Based on the given data, there are several ways to approach this task. Here are three possible steps to infer the rules:

1. Grouping by label: The first step is to group the molecules based on their labels (0 or 1). This will help in identifying any patterns or trends among the molecules that may be causing the side effects.

2. Identifying common features: Once the molecules are grouped, the next step is to identify any common features among them. For example, do they have similar structures or functional groups? Are there any specific atoms or bonds that are present in all the molecules that cause side effects?

3. Developing rules: Based on the common features identified in step 2, develop rules that can accurately predict whether a molecule will cause side effects. These rules should be specific and easy to apply to new molecules.

Overall, the goal is to create a set of rules that can be used to predict whether a molecule will cause side effects based on its structure and properties.
