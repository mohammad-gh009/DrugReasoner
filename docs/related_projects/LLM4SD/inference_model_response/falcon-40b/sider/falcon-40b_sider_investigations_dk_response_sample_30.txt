Based on the given data, we can infer that molecules that have a positive label (i.e., 1) are more likely to cause adverse effects than those with a negative label (i.e., 0). Therefore, we can create three rules based on the properties and structures of these molecules:

Rule 1: Molecules with a positive label are more likely to contain nitrogen atoms in their structure.

Rule 2: Molecules with a positive label are more likely to contain carbonyl groups in their structure.

Rule 3: Molecules with a positive label are more likely to contain halogen atoms in their structure.

These rules can be used to predict whether a molecule is likely to cause adverse effects or not. However, it is important to note that these rules may not always be accurate and should be used in conjunction with other factors such as clinical trials and patient history.
