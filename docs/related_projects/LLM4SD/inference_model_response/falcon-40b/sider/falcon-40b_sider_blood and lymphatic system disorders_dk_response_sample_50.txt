Based on the given data, we can infer that molecules that have a positive label (i.e., 1) are more likely to cause adverse effects than those with a negative label (i.e., 0). Therefore, we need to identify the structural features or properties of these molecules that contribute to their potential toxicity.

To do this, we can use machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, neural networks, or support vector machines to analyze the chemical structures and properties of the molecules in the dataset. We can also use feature selection techniques to identify the most important features that contribute to the prediction of toxicity.

Once we have identified the relevant features, we can formulate three rules that directly relate them to the toxicity of a molecule. These rules can be used to classify new molecules as toxic or non-toxic based on their chemical structure and properties.

For example, one rule could be that molecules with certain functional groups or substructures are more likely to cause toxicity. Another rule could be that molecules with specific molecular weights or solubilities are more likely to be toxic. Finally, a third rule could be that molecules with certain electronic properties or reactivity patterns are more likely to cause toxicity.

Overall, the goal of this exercise is to develop a set of rules that can accurately predict the toxicity of new molecules based on their chemical structure and properties.
