Chlorine atoms, on the other hand, tend to stabilize molecules and make them less reactive, reducing their potential for causing harm. Sulfur atoms also tend to form more complex structures and can react with biological systems in ways that can lead to adverse effects. However, these rules should be used with caution and in conjunction with other factors such as dose, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility.
