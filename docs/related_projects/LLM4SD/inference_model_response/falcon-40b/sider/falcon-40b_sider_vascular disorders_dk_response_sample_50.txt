2. The presence of a nitrogen atom in the structure of a molecule decreases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.

3. The presence of a sulfur atom in the structure of a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is likely to cause adverse effects:

3. The presence of sulfur atoms in the molecule, especially if they are part of a thiol group or a disulfide bond, increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.

These rules are based on the observation that many molecules that have been found to cause adverse effects contain one or more of these structural features. However, it is important to note that these rules are not foolproof and there may be other factors that contribute to a molecule's toxicity.
