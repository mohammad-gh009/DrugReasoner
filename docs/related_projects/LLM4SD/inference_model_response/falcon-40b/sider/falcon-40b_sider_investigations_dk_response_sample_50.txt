1. The first step in inferring the rules is to identify the molecules that have been labeled as causing adverse effects and those that have not. This can be done by examining the SMILES strings associated with each molecule.

2. The next step is to identify any common structural features or patterns among the molecules that have been labeled as causing adverse effects. This can be done by examining the SMILES strings and identifying any recurring motifs or functional groups.

3. Once common structural features have been identified, it is important to determine if they are necessary for the molecule to cause adverse effects. This can be done by examining the SMILES strings of molecules that have been labeled as causing adverse effects but do not possess the common structural feature. If these molecules still cause adverse effects, then the common structural feature may not be necessary for the molecule to cause adverse effects.

4. Finally, it is important to examine the SMILES strings of molecules that have been labeled as not causing adverse effects to ensure that they do not possess any of the common structural features identified in step 2. If they do, then these features may not be sufficient for determining whether a molecule will cause adverse effects.

Overall, the process of inferring the rules involves identifying common structural features among molecules that have been labeled as causing adverse effects, determining if these features are necessary for the molecule to cause adverse effects, and examining the SMILES strings of molecules that have been labeled as not causing adverse effects to ensure that they do not possess any of the common structural features identified in step 2.
