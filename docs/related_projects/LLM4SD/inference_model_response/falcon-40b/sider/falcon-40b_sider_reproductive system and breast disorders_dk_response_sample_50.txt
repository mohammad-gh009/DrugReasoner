================================

Based on the given data, there are three possible steps to infer rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:

1. Identify the structural features that are associated with adverse effects. This can be done by examining the labels in the data and identifying patterns or trends in the structures that are labeled as causing adverse effects. For example, some common structural features that may indicate potential toxicity include the presence of certain functional groups, such as halogens or nitro groups, or the presence of specific ring systems.

2. Develop hypotheses about how these structural features contribute to toxicity. This can involve examining the chemical properties and interactions of the molecules in question, as well as their biological activities and mechanisms of action. For example, certain structural features may disrupt important biological processes or interact with key cellular targets in ways that lead to toxicity.

3. Test these hypotheses using additional data and experimental evidence. This can involve conducting further studies to validate the proposed rules and refine them based on new information. For example, additional experiments may be needed to confirm the predictive power of the rules and identify any limitations or exceptions.

Overall, developing accurate and reliable rules for predicting toxicity requires a deep understanding of the underlying chemistry and biology of the molecules in question, as well as careful analysis of the available data and experimental results.
