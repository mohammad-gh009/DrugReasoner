It is always best to consult with a medical professional for advice on potential side effects of any medication.

These rules are based on the observation that molecules containing nitrogen atoms tend to have more complex structures and are more likely to interact with biological systems in ways that can lead to adverse effects. Chlorine atoms, on the other hand, tend to stabilize molecules and make them less reactive, reducing their potential for causing harm. Sulfur atoms also tend to form more complex structures and can react with biological systems in ways that can lead to adverse effects. However, these rules should be used with caution and in conjunction with other factors such as dose, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility.
