Based on the given data, we can infer that there are three main factors that contribute to the side effects of molecules related to eye disorders:

1. The presence of certain functional groups or chemical structures in the molecule, such as amines, sulfonamides, and carboxylic acids.

2. The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of the molecule, which can affect its ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and reach the target site in the eye.

3. The pharmacokinetic properties of the molecule, such as its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), which can affect its overall safety and efficacy.

To develop three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is likely to cause adverse effects, we need to consider these three factors and their interactions. Here are some possible rules:

Rule 1: If a molecule contains certain functional groups or chemical structures known to be associated with side effects, such as amines, sulfonamides, or carboxylic acids, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.

Rule 2: If a molecule has a high molecular weight or low water solubility, it is more likely to accumulate in the body and cause side effects.

Rule 3: If a molecule has poor ADME properties, such as low bioavailability or rapid clearance, it is more likely to have limited therapeutic effects and cause side effects.

These rules are general guidelines and may not apply to all cases. It is important to note that predicting the potential side effects of a new molecule requires careful analysis and testing, and should involve a multidisciplinary team of experts in chemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology.

Based on the given data, we can infer that molecules that have certain structural features or properties may be more likely to cause adverse effects. Here are three rules that can help us make predictions:

1. Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors are more likely to cause adverse effects. This rule is based on the observation that many of the molecules labeled as causing adverse effects have a high number of H-bond donors and acceptors, while those labeled as not causing adverse effects do not.

2. Molecules with a high number of aromatic rings are more likely to cause adverse effects. This rule is based on the observation that many of the molecules labeled as causing adverse effects have a high number of aromatic rings, while those labeled as not causing adverse effects do not.

3. Molecules with a high number of polar groups are more likely to cause adverse effects. This rule is based on the observation that many of the molecules labeled as causing adverse effects have a high number of polar groups, while those labeled as not causing adverse effects do not.

Using these rules, we can classify new molecules into one of three categories: "causes adverse effects", "does not cause adverse effects", or "unknown". We can then use additional information about the molecule, such as its chemical structure or known side effects, to refine our classification.
