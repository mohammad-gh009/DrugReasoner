Based on the given data, we can infer that molecules that have a positive label (i.e., 1) are more likely to cause adverse effects than those with a negative label (i.e., 0). Therefore, we need to identify patterns or features in the structures of these molecules that could be responsible for their toxicity.

One approach could be to use machine learning algorithms to analyze the chemical structures and identify commonalities among the molecules that cause adverse effects. This could involve techniques such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and feature selection. We could also consider using cheminformatics tools to visualize the structures and identify potential interactions between different parts of the molecules.

Once we have identified some key features or patterns, we can start building rules based on them. For example, if we find that certain functional groups or substructures are consistently present in the toxic molecules, we could create a rule that says "molecules containing X are more likely to cause adverse effects." Similarly, if we notice that certain types of bonds or conformations are associated with toxicity, we could create rules that take those factors into account.

Of course, this is just one possible approach, and there may be other factors or variables that are important to consider. It's also worth noting that any rules we develop will need to be validated through further testing and experimentation before they can be used in practice.
