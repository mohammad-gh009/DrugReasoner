Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is can cause adverse effect:

1. If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects during pregnancy.

2. If a molecule contains a chlorine atom in its structure, it is less likely to cause adverse effects during pregnancy.

3. If a molecule contains a sulfur atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects during pregnancy.

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is likely to cause adverse effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions:

1. If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
2. If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, it is more likely to cause adverse effects.
3. If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine), it is more likely to cause adverse effects.

These rules are based on the observation that many molecules known to cause adverse effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions contain one or more of these structural features. However, it is important to note that these rules are not foolproof and should be used in conjunction with other information and clinical judgment when assessing the potential risks of a particular drug or chemical.

Based on the given data, we can infer three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is likely to cause adverse effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions.

Rule 1: Molecules with a high number of hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) and acceptors (HBAs) are more likely to cause adverse effects.

This rule can be inferred from the data by looking at the number of HBDs and HBAs in each molecule. For example, molecules with a high number of HBDs and HBAs such as CCC(C)C(=O)OC1CC(C=C(C=C1)CO)[C@H](CCN(C)C(=O)O)C(=O)N1)CC(=O)O (0), CC1=C(C=C(C=C1)C#N)C2=CC=NC=C2 (0), and C1=CC(=C(C=C1)N1)C2=CC=CC=C2 (0) are all predicted to have adverse effects. On the other hand, molecules with a low number of HBDs and HBAs such as C1=CC(=C(C=C1)Cl)COC(CN2C=CN=C2)C3=C(C=C(C=C3)Cl)Cl (0), CC(C)C(=O)OC1CC(C=C2C1C(C(C=C2)C)CCC3CC(CC(=O)O3)O)C (1), and C1=CC(=C(C=C1)N/N=C/2\C=CC(=O)

3. Molecules with a high number of aromatic rings are more likely to cause adverse effects. This is because molecules with a high number of aromatic rings are more stable and less likely to break down in the body, which can lead to longer exposure times and increased toxicity.
