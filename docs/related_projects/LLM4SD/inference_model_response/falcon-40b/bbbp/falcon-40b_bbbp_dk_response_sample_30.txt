1. The first rule is that molecules with a BBBP structure have a smile string that contains the substring "BBBP". This can be inferred by looking at the data and identifying patterns in the smile strings of molecules that have been labeled as BBBP.

2. The second rule is that molecules with a BBBP structure do not contain the substring "NOT BBBP". This can also be inferred from the data by identifying patterns in the smile strings of molecules that have been labeled as NOT BBBP.

3. The third rule is that molecules with a BBBP structure have a smile string that contains the substring "BBBP" and does not contain the substring "NOT BBBP". This can be inferred by combining the previous two rules.
