================================

Based on the given data, there are several ways to approach this problem. Here are three possible steps to infer rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is toxic or not:

1. Identify common structural features among the molecules that are labeled as toxic and those that are not. This can be done using various machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines, or neural networks.

2. Use these identified features to create a set of rules that can classify new molecules as toxic or non-toxic. These rules can be based on the presence or absence of certain structural motifs, the number of specific functional groups, or other chemical properties.

3. Test the accuracy of the rules on a separate dataset of molecules to ensure they generalize well and do not overfit to the training data. If necessary, adjust the rules or add more features to improve their performance.

Overall, this process requires a combination of domain knowledge, statistical analysis, and computational modeling to develop effective classification models for predicting toxicity.
