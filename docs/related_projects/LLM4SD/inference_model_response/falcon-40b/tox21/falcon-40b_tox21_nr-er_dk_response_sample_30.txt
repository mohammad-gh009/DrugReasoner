Based on the given data and instructions, here are three rules that can be inferred to directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is toxic or not:

1. If a molecule contains a benzene ring, it is likely to be toxic.
2. If a molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is likely to be toxic.
3. If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it is likely to be toxic.

These rules are based on the observation that many of the molecules labeled as toxic contain one or more of these features. However, it is important to note that these rules may not always hold true and further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between molecular structure and toxicity.
