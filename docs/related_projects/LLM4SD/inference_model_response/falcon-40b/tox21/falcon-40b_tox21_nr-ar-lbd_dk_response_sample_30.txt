Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is toxic or not:

1. The presence of a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) in the molecule increases its toxicity.
2. The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule decreases its toxicity.
3. The presence of a carbonyl group (e.g., CO, C=O) in the molecule increases its toxicity.

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is toxic or not:

1. If the molecule contains a benzene ring, it is likely to be toxic.
2. If the molecule contains a halogen atom, it is likely to be toxic.
3. If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom, it is likely to be toxic.

These rules are based on the observation that most of the molecules labeled as toxic contain one or more of these features, while most of the molecules labeled as non-toxic do not. However, it is important to note that these rules may not always hold true and should be used with caution.

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict whether it is toxic or not:
