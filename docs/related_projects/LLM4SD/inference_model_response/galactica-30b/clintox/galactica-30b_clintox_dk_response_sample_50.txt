Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could help in predicting whether a new molecule will be approved or not by the FDA based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as CCONHC(=O), CNS(=O)(=O)C, COCP(=O)(OP(=O)(OC1CCCCC1)OC1CCCCC1), CCOC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)Br, CCC(C)NO, CCS, CN(C)CS, CCNC(=O)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(cc1)C, CNC(=O)NP(=O)(OC1CCCCC1)OC1CCCCC1, NCCSNC(=O)C, NCNN(C)C, NC(=O)N(C)CSS, O=C(C)C(C)(C)C(=O)O, OC(C)(C)C(=O)NCCSCN, OP(=O)(OC1CCCCC1)OC1CCCCC1, P(=O)([O-])[O-], S(=O)(=O)NCCNSC, SC(=O)N(C)C, SO2C(=O)C(C)(C)C(=O)O, SP(=O)(OC1CCCCC1)OC1CCCCC1, then it has a higher chance of being approved by the FDA.
Rule 2: If the molecule does not contain any of these functional groups but contains a halogen atom like Cl, Br, I, F, etc., then it also has some chances of getting approved by the FDA.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a toxic functional group like NO2, NH3OH+, CH3COOH, H2SO4, HCN, etc., then it

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amines and amides may indicate potential toxicity issues and therefore make the compound less likely to be approved by the FDA.
Rule 2: Molecules containing halogen atoms like bromine or iodine have been shown to increase metabolic stability and reduce toxicity in some cases, making them more favorable candidates for approval.
Rule 3: Compounds with low molecular weight and simple structures tend to have lower toxicity profiles compared to larger and more complex molecules. Therefore, compounds with fewer than ten carbon atoms and no more than two rings are generally more likely to be approved by the FDA.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom in a molecule increases its chances of being approved by the FDA as it enhances its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets. Therefore, molecules containing ammonium or amine groups have higher probabilities of being approved than those without such functional groups.
Rule 2: Molecules with polar functional groups like carbonyl, carboxyl, hydroxyl, and sulfhydryl groups tend to exhibit better solubility and permeability across cell membranes compared to nonpolar compounds. This makes them more likely to be approved by the FDA.
Rule 3: The number and position of aromatic rings in a molecule also play a significant role in determining its approval status. Generally, molecules with multiple fused or substituted aromatic rings show improved pharmacokinetic profiles due to their increased lipophilicity and reduced flexibility. However, excessive hydrophobicity may lead to poor aqueous solubility and high toxicity, which could negatively impact the safety profile of the drug candidate.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups such as amide bonds or aromatic rings may indicate that the compound has potential therapeutic value and could be considered for further development. However, these features alone do not guarantee approval by the FDA.
Rule 2: The molecular weight and lipophilicity of a compound play important roles in determining its absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profile. Generally, compounds with lower molecular weights and higher lipophilicities tend to have better ADMET properties than those with higher molecular weights and lower lipophilicities. Therefore, it may be beneficial to prioritize molecules with low molecular weights and high lipophilicities during drug discovery efforts.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a compound can also affect its biological activity and pharmacokinetic properties. For example, chiral drugs often exhibit different activities depending on their configuration. Therefore, it is important to consider the stereochemical aspects of candidate molecules when evaluating their potential therapeutic utility.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could help in predicting whether a molecule can be approved by FDA or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a positively charged nitrogen atom, then it may fail clinical trials due to toxicity issues. Therefore, molecules containing such atoms should be labeled as 0 (failed clinical trial) unless there are other factors that suggest otherwise.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a negatively charged oxygen atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may also fail clinical trials due to toxicity issues. Therefore, molecules containing such atoms should be labeled as 0 unless there are other factors that suggest otherwise.
Rule 3: If a molecule has a functional group that is known to cause toxicity, then it may fail clinical trials regardless of any other structural features. For example, molecules containing a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) have been associated with severe side effects and should be labeled as 0 unless there are other factors that suggest otherwise.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amide, ester or carboxylic acid in a compound increases its chances of being toxic and may lead to failure during clinical trials. Therefore, compounds without these functional groups have higher probability of getting approval from FDA.
Rule 2: Compounds containing halogens like fluorine, chlorine or bromine tend to show high lipophilicity which makes them more likely to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets. However, excessive halogenation can also increase their toxicity due to their reactivity towards proteins and other cellular components. Hence, moderate levels of halogenation may be tolerated while highly fluorinated molecules should be avoided.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a compound's structure play important roles in determining its pharmacokinetic profile including absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. Longer and more complex structures often result in poor solubility and low bioavailability leading to lower efficacy and increased risk of adverse effects. Therefore, simpler and shorter compounds with fewer chiral centers and less complex stereochemistry may have better chance of success in clinical trials.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyls and amines may indicate potential toxicity issues and therefore hinder approval by the FDA. Therefore, molecules without these functional groups are more likely to be approved.
Rule 2: Molecules containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or iodine tend to have higher lipophilicity which could lead to increased absorption in the body but also increase the risk of toxicity. Therefore, molecules without halogens are more likely to be approved.
Rule 3: Molecules with complex ring structures or multiple chiral centers may require additional testing to ensure their safety and efficacy before they can be approved. Therefore, simpler molecules with fewer rings and stereocenters are more likely to be approved.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecule contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms, then it may be approved by FDA. However, if any other element such as oxygen or nitrogen is present in the molecule, it may not be approved due to potential toxicity issues.
Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl, carboxyl, or nitro groups may indicate potential toxicity issues and make the molecule less likely to be approved by FDA.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of the molecule may also play a role in its approval status. Longer and more complex molecules may have higher chances of causing adverse reactions and therefore may not be approved by FDA.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amide, sulfonamide, and carboxylic acid may indicate potential toxicity issues and make the compound less likely to be approved by the FDA. These functional groups can cause adverse reactions in the body or interact with other drugs, leading to harmful effects. Therefore, compounds without these functional groups may have a higher chance of being approved by the FDA.
Rule 2: Compounds containing halogen atoms such as chlorine, bromine, and iodine tend to be more stable and less reactive than their non-halogenated counterparts. However, they may also increase the likelihood of toxicity due to their ability to form free radicals and disrupt cellular processes. Therefore, careful consideration should be given when selecting halogens for drug development.
Rule 3: The number of rotatable bonds in a compound can affect its solubility and bioavailability. Generally, fewer than five rotatable bonds are considered ideal for oral absorption. Therefore, compounds with high numbers of rotatable bonds may require additional modifications to improve their pharmacokinetic profile.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could help in predicting whether a molecule can be approved by FDA or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it has a higher chance of being approved by FDA as compared to molecules without this functional group. This rule is supported by the fact that many drugs contain C=O groups which play a crucial role in their biological activity.
Rule 2: Molecules containing halogen atoms such as chlorine (Cl) have a lower probability of being approved by FDA due to their potential toxicity issues. This rule is supported by the observation that some organochlorine compounds have been found to cause adverse health effects including cancer and reproductive problems.
Rule 3: Molecules having a heterocyclic ring system consisting of nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) atoms tend to fail clinical trials due to their high reactivity and potential toxicity. This rule is supported by the fact that many toxic substances such as pyridine and quinolone contain N and O heterocycles.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could help in predicting whether a new molecule will be approved or not by the FDA based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), it may fail clinical trials due to toxicity issues. This rule applies to molecules numbered 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could help in predicting whether a molecule can be approved by FDA or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a silicon atom bonded to two oxygen atoms, it may fail clinical trials due to toxicity issues. Therefore, such molecules should be labeled as 0 (failed) rather than 1 (approved).
Rule 2: If a molecule has a positively charged nitrogen atom attached to a carbon atom with a double bond to another carbon atom, it may also fail clinical trials due to toxicity issues. Therefore, such molecules should also be labeled as 0 (failed) rather than 1 (approved).
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have adverse effects on human health and should therefore be labeled as 0 (failed) instead of 1 (approved).

================================

Rule 1: The presence of positively charged functional groups such as ammonium ions or amines in a molecule may increase its chances of being toxic and therefore not approved by the FDA. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.
Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic rings may have increased hydrophobicity and may be more likely to fail clinical trials due to toxicity issues. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.
Rule 3: The absence of polar functional groups such as hydroxyl or carboxyl groups in a molecule may decrease its solubility in water and make it less likely to pass through cell membranes. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amides and esters in a compound may indicate potential toxicity issues and make them less likely to be approved by the FDA. Therefore, compounds without these functional groups are more likely to pass clinical trials and receive approval from the FDA.
Rule 2: Compounds containing nitrogen atoms in their structure have a higher chance of being approved by the FDA compared to those lacking this element. This is because many drugs contain nitrogen-containing heterocycles or amines which play important roles in their biological activity.
Rule 3: The number of chiral centers present in a compound can also affect its likelihood of receiving approval from the FDA. Generally, compounds with fewer than three chiral centers tend to be easier to synthesize and characterize, making them more attractive candidates for drug development.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could help in predicting whether a molecule can be approved by FDA or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom, it may fail clinical trials due to toxicity issues. Therefore, molecules without any fluorine atoms should be considered for approval.
Rule 2: Molecules containing nitrogen-containing rings such as pyridine or pyrimidine may also cause toxicity issues and therefore should be avoided during drug development.
Rule 3: The presence of certain functional groups such as carboxylic acid, ester, amide, or sulfonamide may increase the chances of a molecule being toxic and hence should be carefully evaluated before considering them for approval.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could help in predicting whether a new molecule will be approved or not by the FDA based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as CC(C)(CO)[C@H](C(=O)NCCCO)O, c1c(cc(c(c1S(=O)(=O)N)Cl)Cl)S(=O)(=O)N, C[C@]12CC[C@@H]3c4ccc(cc4CC[C@H]3[C@@H]1CC[C@@H]2OP(=O)([O-])[O-])OC(=O)N(CCCl)CCCl, CCC1(C(=O)C(CNC1=O)C)CC, C[C@@H]([C@@H](c1ccc(cc1)O)O)[NH2+]CCc2ccc(cc2)O, CCC(=O)OC(C(C)C)OP(=O)(CCCCc1ccccc1)CC(=O)N2C[C@@H](C[C@H]2C(=O)[O-])C3CCCCC3, C[NH+](C)CCOc1ccc(cc1)/C(=C(/CCCl)\c2ccccc2)/c3ccccc3, CC(C)C[C@@H](C(=O)N[C@@H](CCCN=C(N)N)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)NNC(=O)N)NC(=O)[C@@H](COC(C)(C)C)NC(=O)[C@H

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could help in predicting whether a molecule can be approved by FDA or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it may have toxic effects and fail clinical trials. Therefore, molecules without this functional group are more likely to be approved by FDA.
Rule 2: Molecules containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or iodine tend to have higher lipophilicity and may cause toxicity issues during clinical trials. Therefore, molecules without these elements are more likely to be approved by FDA.
Rule 3: Molecules containing nitrogen-containing groups such as amines or amides may have toxic effects due to their reactivity towards other biological molecules. Therefore, molecules without these groups are more likely to be approved by FDA.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom in a molecule increases its chances of being approved by the FDA as it enhances its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets. Therefore, molecules containing ammonium or guanidinium groups are more likely to be approved than those without such functional groups.
Rule 2: Molecules that contain polar functional groups like hydroxyl, carboxyl, and sulfhydryl groups tend to have lower solubility in water and may cause adverse reactions in humans. Hence, they should be avoided when designing drugs.
Rule 3: The length and flexibility of a molecule's carbon chain also play a crucial role in determining its efficacy and safety. Longer chains increase hydrophobicity, which affects absorption and distribution within the body. Flexible chains allow for better interaction with target proteins but may also lead to increased toxicity due to their non-specific binding. Therefore, optimizing the balance between lipophilicity and hydrophilicity is essential for drug design.

================================

Rule 1: If there's a carbonyl group present in the structure and it is attached to a nitrogen atom, then the molecule has a higher chance of being approved by the FDA. This rule applies to molecules like CC1=C(C(=O)N2CCCCC2=N1)CCN3CCC(CC3)C4=NOC5=C4C=CC(=C5)F (with label 1) where the presence of the carbonyl group makes it easier for the drug to interact with its target protein. However, this rule does not apply to all cases as seen from Cc1nnc(s1)SCC2=C(N3[C@@H]([C@@H](C3=O)NC(=O)Cn4cnnn4)SC2)C(=O)[O-] (with label 0) which also contains a carbonyl group but fails clinical trials due to toxicity issues.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, then it has a higher chance of being approved by the FDA. This rule applies to molecules like CCC1(C(=O)NCNC1=O)c2ccccc2 (with label 1) and COCCCC/C(=N\OCC[NH3+])/c1ccc(cc1)C(F)(F)F (with label 1) where the presence of halogens increases the lipophilicity of the compound making it easier for it to cross cell membranes and reach its target site. However, this rule may not always hold true as seen from B([C@H](CC(C)C)NC(=O)[C@H](Cc1ccccc1)NC(=O)c2cnccn2)(O)O (with label 0) which contains a boron atom instead of a halogen yet still fails clinical trials due to toxicity concerns.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could help in predicting whether a molecule can be approved by FDA or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a phosphate group (PO4), it may fail clinical trials due to toxicity issues. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should be avoided when designing new drugs.
Rule 2: Molecules containing fluorine atoms have been shown to increase metabolic stability and improve drug efficacy. However, they also tend to increase lipophilicity, which can lead to increased toxicity. Therefore, careful consideration must be taken when introducing fluorinated groups into a molecule's structure.
Rule 3: The presence of certain functional groups such as sulfonyl groups (SO2R) has been linked to increased toxicity and should be avoided in drug design. Similarly, compounds containing nitro groups (NO2) should also be avoided because of their potential to cause adverse reactions.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could help in predicting whether a new molecule will be approved or not by the FDA based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, it has a higher chance of being approved by the FDA. This rule is supported by the fact that many drugs contain halogens due to their electronegativity and ability to form hydrogen bonds. However, this rule may not always hold true since some molecules containing halogens have been found to be toxic.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a positively charged nitrogen atom, it has a lower chance of being approved by the FDA. This rule is based on the observation that most drugs are neutral or negatively charged at physiological pH. The presence of positive charges can increase the molecule's reactivity and lead to toxicity issues.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it has a lower chance of being approved by the FDA. Sulfonamides were once widely used antibiotics but have now been replaced by other classes of antibiotics due to their side effects and resistance development. Therefore, any molecule containing a sulfonamide group should be carefully evaluated before making a decision about its approval.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could help in predicting whether a new molecule will be approved or not by the FDA based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as CN, COOR, CONHR, CSNHR etc., then it may fail clinical trials due to toxicity issues. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be avoided while designing drugs.
Rule 2: If the molecule has a positive charge on nitrogen atom, then it may also lead to toxicity issues. Therefore, molecules having positively charged nitrogen atoms should be avoided during drug design.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring or any other aromatic system, then it may cause adverse effects like mutagenicity or carcinogenicity. Therefore, molecules containing aromatic systems should be carefully evaluated before being considered for approval.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amines and amides may indicate potential toxicity issues and therefore make the compound less likely to be approved by the FDA. However, this rule alone cannot determine whether or not the compound will pass clinical trials without further analysis.
Rule 2: The absence of certain functional groups such as halogens may also suggest lower likelihood of approval due to their potential toxicity. Again, however, this rule should only serve as a starting point rather than a definitive predictor.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of the carbon chain in a compound may play a role in its ability to cross cell membranes and reach target sites within the body. Longer chains may require more time and energy to transport, which could lead to slower onset of action or reduced efficacy. Therefore, compounds with shorter and simpler structures may have a higher chance of being approved by the FDA.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could help in predicting whether a new molecule will be approved or not by the FDA based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as CN, COOR, CNO, etc., then it may fail clinical trials due to toxicity issues. Therefore, molecules without these groups are more likely to be approved by the FDA.
Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic rings tend to have higher toxicity than those without them. Hence, they should be avoided while designing drugs.
Rule 3: The presence of certain atoms like sulfur, phosphorus, and nitrogen in a molecule increases its chances of being toxic. Therefore, molecules containing these atoms should also be avoided during drug design.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amines and amides may indicate potential toxicity issues and therefore hinder approval by the FDA. Therefore, molecules without these functional groups are more likely to be approved.
Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may have higher lipophilicity and may be less likely to pass through cell membranes easily compared to those without them. This could affect their bioavailability and potentially lead to failure in clinical trials due to low efficacy.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound can also play a role in its ability to cross biological barriers and reach target sites within the body. Generally, smaller and more hydrophilic compounds tend to be better absorbed and tolerated than larger and more hydrophobic ones. However, there may be exceptions to this rule depending on the specific drug and its intended use.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a carbonyl group (C=O) in the structure of the molecule, then it has a higher chance of being approved by the FDA. This rule applies to molecules 1, 8, and 9.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a heterocyclic ring, such as a pyrimidine or pyridine ring, then it may have better drug-like properties than other types of rings. This rule applies to molecules 2 and 3.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a charged functional group, such as NH3+ or Cl-, then it may not be suitable for oral administration due to its poor solubility in water. This rule applies to molecule 4.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecule contains sulfur and has a double bond between carbon atoms, then it may not be approved by FDA due to potential toxicity concerns. The first two molecules in the given dataset follow this rule.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains fluorine and has a double bond between carbon atoms, then it may not be approved by FDA due to potential toxicity concerns. The sixth molecule in the given dataset follows this rule.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains nitrogen and has a single bond between carbon atoms, then it may be approved by FDA as long as it does not contain any other functional groups or structural features that could cause toxicity issues. The last three molecules in the given dataset follow this rule.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amides and amines in a compound may indicate potential toxicity issues and make them less likely to be approved by the FDA. Therefore, compounds without these functional groups are more likely to pass clinical trials and receive approval from the FDA.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may have higher lipophilicity and lower water solubility, which could lead to poor absorption and bioavailability. These types of compounds may require modifications to improve their pharmacokinetic profile before they can be considered for FDA approval.
Rule 3: The charge on a compound can affect its stability and reactivity. Neutral compounds are generally more stable than charged ones, so positively charged molecules may be less likely to be approved due to concerns about chemical instability. Negatively charged compounds may also be less favorable because they tend to interact strongly with other negatively charged species in the body, leading to potential toxicity issues.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of negatively charged functional groups such as sulfonyl or phosphate groups in a drug molecule may increase its chances of being approved by the FDA due to their ability to interact with positively charged amino acid residues on target proteins. However, the absence of these groups does not necessarily guarantee approval.
Rule 2: The number and position of halogen atoms (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) in a drug molecule can significantly affect its pharmacokinetic properties, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Therefore, drugs containing halogens are often preferred over those without them because they tend to have better bioavailability and longer half-lives.
Rule 3: The length and flexibility of a drug molecule can also play a role in its efficacy and safety. Drugs with shorter chains and fewer rotatable bonds may be easier to synthesize and more stable, but they may also have limited access to certain binding sites within target proteins. On the other hand, drugs with longer chains and greater flexibility may have higher potency and specificity, but they may also be more prone to degradation and off-target effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of halogen atoms such as fluorine or chlorine in a compound increases its lipophilicity and enhances its ability to cross cell membranes. Therefore, compounds containing these elements may have better pharmacokinetic profiles than those without them. However, excessive amounts of halogens can also increase the risk of toxicity due to their electronegativity and potential for metabolic reactions. Hence, careful consideration should be given to the number and position of halogen substituents when predicting the safety and efficacy of a drug candidate.
Rule 2: The stability and reactivity of a compound depend on its functional groups and chemical structure. For example, carbonyl groups (C=O) are often associated with increased stability but can also lead to toxicity through protein binding or oxidative stress. On the other hand, double bonds between carbon atoms (C=C) can enhance the reactivity of a compound but may also facilitate interactions with biological targets. Therefore, the balance between stability and reactivity must be carefully considered during drug design.
Rule 3: The charge and polarity of a compound can affect its solubility and bioavailability. Ionizable groups such as amines (NH+) or carboxylic acids (COOH) can confer positive or negative charges respectively, which can improve aqueous solubility at physiological pH. However, charged molecules may also have limited membrane permeability and require specialized transport mechanisms to reach target sites. Neutral polar moieties like hydroxyl (OH) or amino (NH2) groups can also contribute to water solubility but may not be sufficient alone unless they are present in high numbers or conjugated to lipophilic structures. Overall, understanding the physicochemical properties of a compound is crucial for predicting its behavior in vivo and optimizing its therapeutic potential.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could help in predicting whether a new molecule will be approved or not by the FDA based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as CCONHC(=O)R' where R' is any organic substituent, then it has a high chance of being approved by the FDA. This rule is based on the fact that this functional group is commonly found in many drugs that have been successfully marketed.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or iodine, then it has a low chance of being approved by the FDA. This rule is based on the fact that halogens are often associated with toxicity issues and may cause adverse reactions in patients.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (SO2NR''R''') where R'' and R''' are any organic substituents, then it has a moderate chance of being approved by the FDA. This rule is based on the fact that sulfonamides are widely used antibiotics and have proven efficacy in treating bacterial infections. However, they also have the potential to cause serious side effects such as hypersensitivity reactions and bone marrow suppression, which may limit their use in certain patient populations.

================================

Rule 1: If there's a carbonyl group present in the structure, then it may indicate that the compound has some level of stability and could potentially pass clinical trials. However, it does not necessarily mean that the compound will be approved by the FDA as other factors such as safety and efficacy must also be considered.
Rule 2: The presence of a sulfonyl group or sulfate group indicates that the compound may have some level of reactivity which could make it more toxic. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated before being considered for approval.
Rule 3: Compounds that contain fluorine atoms tend to have higher metabolic stability than their non-fluorinated counterparts. This property makes them attractive candidates for drug development since they are less likely to be broken down during metabolism. Therefore, fluorinated compounds may have a better chance of passing clinical trials and getting approved by the FDA.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and amide in a compound increases its chances of being approved by the FDA due to their therapeutic benefits. However, compounds containing toxic functional groups like nitro groups should be avoided.
Rule 2: Compounds with low molecular weight and high lipophilicity have higher probabilities of passing clinical trials than those with high molecular weight and low lipophilicity. This is because highly lipophilic molecules tend to accumulate in tissues and cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: The number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors present in a compound plays a crucial role in determining its bioavailability. Generally, compounds with fewer hydrogen bond donors and acceptors are more likely to pass clinical trials.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of chlorine atoms in a compound increases its chances of being approved by the FDA as they increase metabolic stability and reduce toxicity. Therefore, compounds containing chlorine atoms may have a higher chance of success than those without them.
Rule 2: Compounds that contain functional groups such as carbonyls or carboxylic acids tend to have lower solubility and may not be suitable for oral administration. They may also exhibit high toxicity due to their ability to bind to proteins non-specifically. Hence, these types of compounds should be avoided when designing drugs.
Rule 3: Molecules that contain aromatic rings are often associated with increased lipophilicity and may have better membrane permeability compared to aliphatic molecules. However, they may also show higher toxicity due to their ability to interact with biological macromolecules. Therefore, careful consideration must be given while selecting aromatic moieties for drug design.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of fluorine in a compound may increase its lipophilicity and improve its pharmacokinetic profile but also increases the risk of toxicity. Therefore, fluorinated compounds should be carefully evaluated before being approved by the FDA.
Rule 2: Compounds containing polar functional groups such as carboxylic acids or amines may have better aqueous solubility than nonpolar ones, which could lead to improved absorption and distribution profiles. However, these functional groups may also increase the likelihood of off-target interactions and toxicity. Therefore, careful consideration must be given to the balance between hydrophilicity and lipophilicity when designing new drugs.
Rule 3: The number and position of double bonds in a compound can significantly affect its physical and chemical properties, including its stability, reactivity, and biological activity. Therefore, it is important to consider the structural features of a candidate drug molecule during the design process to optimize its therapeutic potential while minimizing any risks associated with its use.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups such as amide bonds or heterocyclic rings may indicate potential toxicity issues and make the compound less likely to be approved by the FDA. Therefore, compounds without these functional groups may have a higher chance of being approved.
Rule 2: Compounds containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine tend to have longer half-lives in the body due to their resistance to metabolic degradation. This property makes them more desirable candidates for drug development. However, excessive use of halogens can also lead to toxicity concerns. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the number and position of halogen atoms in a candidate compound.
Rule 3: The charge on a compound can affect its solubility and bioavailability. Neutral compounds are generally more water-soluble than charged ones, which can impact their ability to cross cell membranes and reach target sites within the body. Therefore, neutral compounds may have a better chance of being approved by the FDA compared to charged ones.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could help in predicting whether a molecule can be approved by the FDA or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a metal ion such as chlorine or manganese, it may fail clinical trials due to potential side effects. Therefore, molecules containing these ions should be labeled as 0 (failed clinical trial).
Rule 2: If a molecule has a toxicophore group such as sulfonyl or carbonyl groups, it may cause adverse reactions in humans. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should also be labeled as 0.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a charged functional group such as ammonium or carboxylate, it may have poor pharmacokinetic properties and fail clinical trials. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should also be labeled as 0.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of positively charged functional groups such as ammonium or amine groups increases the chances of a molecule being toxic and hence not approved by the FDA. This is because these groups can interact with negatively charged molecules in the body, leading to adverse effects. Therefore, molecules without these groups may have a higher chance of being approved by the FDA.
Rule 2: Molecules containing polar functional groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, and carbonyl groups tend to be more soluble in water than nonpolar ones. These groups can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, making them easier to absorb and distribute throughout the body. Hence, molecules with high aqueous solubility may have a better chance of being approved by the FDA due to their ability to penetrate cell membranes easily.
Rule 3: The absence of certain functional groups such as sulfonyl, nitro, and halogen groups may increase the likelihood of a molecule being approved by the FDA. These groups are often associated with toxicity and may cause adverse reactions in the body. Therefore, molecules lacking these groups may be less likely to cause harm and may be considered safer options.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amines and amides may indicate potential toxicity issues and therefore make the compound less likely to be approved by the FDA. This rule applies to molecules containing CC(CN1c2ccccc2Sc3c1cccc3)[NH+](C)C or C[C@@H]1CC[C@H]2C[C@@H](/C(=C/C=C/C=C/[C@H](C[C@H](C(=O)[C@@H]([C@@H](/C(=C/[C@H](C(=O)C[C@H](OC(=O)[C@@H]3CCCCN3C(=O)C(=O)[C@@]1(O2)O)[C@H](C)C[C@@H]4CC[C@H]([C@@H](C4)OC)OCCO)C)/C)O)OC)C)C)/C)OC.
Rule 2: Molecules without any functional groups or those with only benign ones like halogens may have a higher chance of being approved by the FDA. This rule applies to molecules containing c1ccc(cc1)C2(CC[NH+](CC2)CCC(C#N)(c3ccccc3)c4ccccc4)C(=O)[O-] or CCCCCOc1cc(ccc1N)C(=O)OCC[NH+](CC)CC.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and lipophilicity of a compound play important roles in its absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profile. Generally, smaller and more hydrophilic compounds tend to have better ADMET profiles than larger and more lipophilic ones. Therefore

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amides and esters may indicate potential toxicity issues and therefore hinder approval by the FDA. These functional groups can cause adverse reactions in the body when exposed to certain conditions or environments. Therefore, molecules containing these functional groups should be carefully evaluated before being considered for approval.
Rule 2: Molecules with complex structures and multiple chiral centers may also pose challenges for approval due to their increased susceptibility to degradation and metabolism. Such molecules may require additional testing and optimization to ensure they meet safety standards set by regulatory agencies like the FDA.
Rule 3: The absence of specific functional groups or structural features does not necessarily guarantee approval by the FDA. Other factors such as potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties must also be taken into account during the drug development process. It is important to conduct thorough preclinical and clinical studies to determine whether a particular molecule has the desired therapeutic effect without causing any harmful side effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amines and amides may indicate potential toxicity issues and should be avoided in drug molecules. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should have a label of 0.
Example: C[NH+](C)CCC(c1ccccc1)c2ccccn2 has a label of 0 because it contains an amine group.
Rule 2: Molecules with complex structures or multiple rings may have difficulty passing clinical trials due to their low solubility or high toxicity. Therefore, molecules with simple structures and fewer rings should have a higher chance of being approved by FDA.
Example: CCC(Cc1c(cc(c(c1I)N)I)I)C(=O)[O-] has a label of 0 because it has a complex structure with three rings.
Rule 3: The charge on a molecule can affect its stability and reactivity. Neutral molecules tend to be more stable than charged ones, so neutral molecules may have a better chance of being approved by FDA.
Example: c1cc(ccc1C[C@@H](C(=O)[O-])[NH3+])O has a label of 0 because it is neutral.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amines and amides may indicate potential toxicity issues and therefore make the compound less likely to be approved by the FDA. However, this rule alone cannot determine whether or not a particular compound will pass clinical trials.
Rule 2: Molecules containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or iodine tend to have higher lipophilicity and may be more likely to cross the blood-brain barrier than those without them. This property could potentially lead to improved efficacy in treating neurological disorders but also increases the risk of toxicity due to accumulation in the brain. Therefore, careful consideration must be given when designing compounds with these types of substituents.
Rule 3: Compounds that contain multiple rings or complex structures may be difficult to synthesize and may have lower bioavailability compared to simpler molecules. These factors could negatively impact their ability to reach therapeutic concentrations in vivo and may explain why many drugs fail during clinical development despite showing promising results in pre-clinical studies.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amines and amides in a compound increases its chances of being approved by the FDA due to their ability to interact with biological systems. Therefore, molecules containing these functional groups may have better pharmacokinetic profiles than those without them.
Rule 2: The molecular weight of a drug candidate should not exceed 500 Daltons because larger compounds tend to have lower solubility and higher toxicity. This rule applies to both small organic molecules and peptides.
Rule 3: The lipophilicity of a compound plays a crucial role in determining its absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profile. A balance between hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity is necessary for optimal ADMET properties. Lipophilic compounds tend to have longer half-lives but may also have higher toxicity risks. On the other hand, hydrophilic compounds may have shorter half-lives but are less likely to accumulate in tissues.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of fluorine in a compound may increase its lipophilicity and improve its pharmacokinetic profile but also increases the risk of toxicity. Therefore, compounds containing fluorine should be carefully evaluated before being approved by the FDA.
Rule 2: Compounds containing polar functional groups such as amines or amides tend to have better aqueous solubility than nonpolar ones like hydrocarbons. However, these groups may also increase the likelihood of toxicity due to their ability to interact with biological molecules. Therefore, the balance between hydrophilicity and lipophilicity must be considered when designing new drugs.
Rule 3: The number of chiral centers in a compound can affect its metabolic stability and bioavailability. Generally, compounds with fewer chiral centers are easier to synthesize and may have improved pharmacokinetic profiles compared to those with many chiral centers. However, too few chiral centers may limit the diversity of potential interactions with target proteins.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could help in predicting whether a new molecule will be approved or not by the FDA based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may fail clinical trials due to toxicity issues. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should be labeled as 0 (failed) rather than 1 (approved).
Rule 2: Molecules having a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring tend to cause toxicity problems and should also be labeled as 0 (failed) instead of 1 (approved).
Rule 3: If a molecule has a negative charge on one of its atoms, it may have higher chances of being toxic and should therefore be labeled as 0 (failed) instead of 1 (approved).

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups such as sulfonamide or nitro groups may indicate potential toxicity and therefore make the compound less likely to be approved by the FDA.
Rule 2: Molecules containing fluorine atoms in their structure have been shown to increase metabolic stability and bioavailability, making them more likely to be approved by the FDA.
Rule 3: Compounds that contain nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as pyrimidines, triazoles, or indoles tend to exhibit favorable pharmacokinetic profiles and are often considered promising drug candidates.

================================

Rule 1: If there's any halogen atom present in the compound, it may fail clinical trials due to its toxic nature. Therefore, compounds without halogens or containing only fluorine atoms could potentially be approved by the FDA.
Rule 2: The presence of amide bonds in a compound increases its chances of being approved by the FDA as they are commonly found in drugs and have good stability and solubility. However, if the amide bond is part of a larger ring structure, it may not be easily broken down in the body leading to potential toxicity issues.
Rule 3: Compounds with nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as pyrimidines, triazoles, and pyridines tend to have better pharmacokinetic profiles than those without them. These rings provide additional interactions with biological targets and improve drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could help in predicting whether a new molecule will be approved or not by the FDA based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to a cyclic ring, it may fail clinical trials due to toxicity issues. Therefore, molecules containing this feature should be labeled as 0 (failed) rather than 1 (approved).
Rule 2: If the molecule has a positively charged nitrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom, it may also fail clinical trials due to toxicity concerns. Therefore, such molecules should also be labeled as 0 (failed) instead of 1 (approved).
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a negatively charged oxygen atom bonded to two carbon atoms, it may have potential therapeutic benefits but needs further investigation before being approved by the FDA. Therefore, such molecules should be labeled as 1 (approved with caution) instead of 0 (failed).

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could help in predicting whether a new molecule will be approved or not by the FDA based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it may fail clinical trials due to toxicity issues unless it is used as part of another larger compound where the C=O group does not interfere with the overall safety profile of the drug. Therefore, molecules containing only isolated C=O groups should be avoided when designing drugs.
Rule 2: Molecules containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine tend to have higher lipophilicity than their non-halogenated counterparts, which can lead to increased toxicity and decreased efficacy. Therefore, these types of functional groups should be avoided or minimized in drug design.
Rule 3: The presence of certain functional groups such as sulfonyl groups (SO2R), amides (CONHR), or amines (NR2) can increase the likelihood of a molecule being toxic and therefore should be carefully evaluated during drug development. These groups can interact with biological systems in ways that can cause adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amines and amides may indicate potential toxicity issues and therefore make the compound less likely to be approved by the FDA. This rule applies to molecules 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 in the given dataset.
Rule 2: Molecules containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine tend to have higher lipophilicity and may be more likely to pass through cell membranes and reach their target sites. Therefore, these compounds may be more promising candidates for drug development. This rule applies to molecules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 25 in the given dataset.
Rule 3: Compounds that contain heterocyclic rings such as thiophene, furan, or pyridine may exhibit different biological activities compared to their non-heterocyclic counterparts due to their unique electronic and structural features. These types of structures may also improve pharmacokinetic properties such as solubility and metabolic stability. However, they may still pose safety concerns and require further evaluation before being considered for approval. This rule applies to molecules 1, 26 in the given dataset.
