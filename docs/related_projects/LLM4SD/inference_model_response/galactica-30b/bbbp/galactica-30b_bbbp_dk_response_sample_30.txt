Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the structure of a compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This rule applies to all compounds containing this functional group regardless of their other structural features.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a benzene ring and a double bond between two carbon atoms adjacent to the ring, then it cannot be BBBP. This rule applies specifically to compounds such as biphenyls or stilbenes.
Rule 3: A compound containing a nitrogen atom bonded to three carbon atoms and one hydrogen atom (i.e., a primary amine) may or may not be BBBP depending on its other structural features. However, if there is also a double bond between two carbon atoms adjacent to the nitrogen atom, then it cannot be BBBP.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-C#N" in a compound indicates that it may have the property of being BBBP. This rule applies to compounds 7 and 8.
Rule 2: If a compound contains two or more benzene rings connected by single bonds, then it may have the property of being BBBP. This rule applies to compounds 9 and 10.
Rule 3: A compound containing chlorine atoms on adjacent carbon atoms may have the property of being BBBP. This rule applies to compounds 11 and 12.

================================

Rule 1: If the compound has a benzene ring and a carbonyl group connected by a single bond, then it cannot be BBBP. This rule applies to compounds 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 1

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-NO2" in a compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This is because nitro compounds are known for their high reactivity and toxicity, which may interfere with the biological activity required for BBB penetration.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a conjugated system of double bonds or aromatic rings, it may have increased lipophilicity and therefore higher likelihood of crossing the blood-brain barrier. However, this rule alone does not guarantee whether a compound will actually penetrate the brain, as other factors such as molecular size, polarity, and hydrogen bonding also play important roles.
Rule 3: Compounds containing polar functional groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino groups tend to have lower permeability across the blood-brain barrier due to their hydrophilic nature. Therefore, these types of molecules should be avoided when designing drugs targeting the central nervous system.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a double bond between two carbon atoms in a molecule, then it has a high probability of being BBBP. The presence of C=C indicates that the compound may have a conjugated system which is often associated with biological activity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom and a carbonyl group (C=O) connected by a single bond, then it has a low probability of being BBBP. This structure is commonly found in pesticides such as chlorpyrifos, which is known for its toxicity towards insects but not humans or other mammals.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen-containing ring and a fluorine atom, then it has a moderate probability of being BBBP. Fluorine is often used in drug design due to its unique chemical properties, including its ability to increase metabolic stability and membrane permeability. However, it's important to note that the specific effects of fluorination on bioactivity depend on many factors, including the position and number of fluorine substituents.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-C=C-" in the molecular structure indicates that the compound may have the property of being BBBP. This rule applies to molecules such as C3=C(C2C(NC(=O)C1NC(CC1)=O)C2)C=CC=C3 and CC12CC3(CC(C1)(CC(C2)C3)N)C.
Rule 2: If there is a halogen atom present in the molecular structure, then the compound may not be BBBP. For example, [C@H](O)(/C=C/C1=C(C2=C([N]1C(C)C)C=CC=C2)C3=CC=C(F)C=C3)C[C@H](O)CC(=O)O does not contain any halogens but has the functional group "-C=C-" which suggests that it could potentially be BBBP. However, since it also contains the hydroxyl group "-OH" and the carbonyl group "-C(=O)-", these groups may interfere with the ability of the compound to bind to the target protein. Therefore, this rule only provides a general guideline and should be used cautiously.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a nitrogen atom bonded to three carbon atoms, then the compound may not be BBBP. Examples of compounds that do not follow this rule include CN[C@H]1CC[C@@H](c2ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c2)c3ccccc13 and CCC(=C)C(=O)c1ccc(OCC(O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a benzene ring in the molecular structure, then it has a high probability of being BBBP.
Explanation: The first three molecules have a benzene ring and they all have a label of 1 which indicates that they are BBBP.
Rule 2: If there exist halogen atoms such as fluorine or chlorine in the molecular structure, then it has a low probability of being BBBP.
Explanation: The fourth molecule has two fluorine atoms and it has a label of 0 which indicates that it is not BBBP.
Rule 3: If there exists a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecular structure, then it has a moderate probability of being BBBP.
Explanation: The fifth molecule has a nitro group and it has a label of 1 which indicates that it is BBBP.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-CCONHC-" in a compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This rule is based on the fact that this functional group is present in compounds such as c1cc2c(c(nc2cc1)c1ccccc1)OCC(O)=O and C(C(OC4CC3=CCC2C1C(C(CC1)C(C)=O)(CCC2C3(CC4)C)C)=O)CC(O)=O which have been labeled as non-BBBP molecules.
Rule 2: If a compound contains the functional group "-CCl-" or "-CCl2-", then it may be possible for it to be BBBP. This rule is based on the observation that several compounds containing these functional groups have been labeled as BBBP molecules, including CC(N)Cc1ccccc1, CN1N(C(=O)C=C1C)c2ccccc2, and COC(F)(F)C(Cl)Cl.
Rule 3: A compound containing the functional group "-CC#N-" may also be able to be BBBP. This rule is based on the fact that two compounds containing this functional group, namely C1=C(C(=CC=C1Cl)N(C(CN(C(CC#N)C)C)=O)C)C(C2=C(C=CC=C2)F)=O and C1=C(C(CCC)=O)C=CC3=C1N(C2=C(C=CC=C2)S3)CCCN4CCN(C)CC4, have been labeled as BBBP molecules.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-C(=O)NN=C(C)C" in the molecular structure indicates that the compound may have the property of being BBBP. This rule applies to molecules 1 and 6.
Rule 2: If there exists a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine attached to a carbon atom in the aromatic ring, then the molecule cannot be BBBP. This rule applies to molecule 8.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring connected to another ring through a single bond, then it may not be able to bind to the target protein due to steric hindrance. This rule applies to molecule 9.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-CC-" in the molecular structure indicates that the compound may have the property of being BBBP. This rule applies to molecules 6 and 7.
Rule 2: If there exists a nitrogen atom bonded to three carbon atoms or more in the molecular structure, then the compound may not be able to be BBBP. This rule applies to molecules 8 and 9.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains two benzene rings connected by a single bond, then the compound may not be capable of being BBBP. This rule applies to molecule 10.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-COOH" in a compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This is because carboxylic acids have high boiling points and low solubility in water, which makes them unsuitable for use as solvents or reagents in chemical reactions. Therefore, compounds containing this functional group should be labeled as 0 instead of 1 when predicting their ability to be BBBP.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a double bond between two carbon atoms, it may indicate that it can be BBBP. Double bonds increase the polarity of a molecule, making it more soluble in polar solvents like water. However, it's important to note that other factors such as molecular weight and intermolecular forces also play a role in determining a compound's boiling point.
Rule 3: Compounds containing aromatic rings tend to have higher boiling points than those without due to strong intermolecular forces such as pi-pi stacking and van der Waals interactions. Therefore, compounds containing these structures should be labeled as 1 when predicting their ability to be BBBP.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-NO2" in a compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This is because nitro compounds are known for their high reactivity and toxicity, which may interfere with normal biological processes.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, it cannot be BBBP. Halogen atoms are highly reactive and can easily form covalent bonds with other molecules, potentially leading to toxic or harmful effects on living organisms.
Rule 3: A compound containing a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) is unlikely to be BBBP. Sulfonamides are commonly used antibiotics that inhibit bacterial growth by blocking the production of folic acid, a necessary nutrient for cell division. However, some studies have suggested that certain sulfonamide derivatives may have anti-cancer properties. Therefore, further research is needed to determine whether these compounds could be developed into new drugs.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a benzene ring in the molecular structure and it is connected to another functional group such as carbonyl or imine groups through a single bond, then the molecule may have the property of being BBBP. For example, molecules #8, #9, #17, and #20 contain a benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group via a single bond, which suggests that they could potentially be BBBP. However, this rule alone cannot guarantee whether a particular compound will be BBBP since other factors such as electronic effects and steric hindrance also play a role in determining its biological activity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to three carbon atoms in a ring structure, then it may have the property of being BBBP. This is because the presence of a nitrogen atom in a ring structure is often associated with increased lipophilicity, which can enhance the ability of a drug to cross cell membranes and interact with target receptors. Molecules #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #18, and #19 contain a nitrogen atom bonded to three carbon atoms in a ring structure, suggesting that they could potentially be BBBP. Again, however, this rule alone does not guarantee whether a particular compound will be BBBP since other factors such as electronic effects and steric hindrance also play a role in determining its biological activity.
Rule 3: If a molecule has a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine attached to one of its carbon atoms, then it may have the property of being BBBP. Halogen atoms are known for their electron-withdrawing effect, which can increase the acidity of neighboring protons and enhance the reactivity of the molecule. Therefore, compounds containing halogen atoms tend to be more reactive than those without them, making them good

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-C#N" in a compound indicates that it may have the property of being BBBP. This is because compounds containing this functional group often exhibit bioactivity and have been used as drugs or drug candidates. For example, the compound C2=NC1=C(CC(NC)CC1)S2 1 contains the "-C#N" group and has been reported to possess anti-cancer activity.
Rule 2: If a compound contains both a carbonyl group and a double bond between two carbon atoms, then it may be able to act as BBBP. This is because such compounds are often found in natural products and have been shown to have various biological activities. For instance, the compound C1=CC=CC=C1N2C(C(C(NC2=O)=O)(CC)CC)=O 1 contains both a carbonyl group and a double bond between two carbon atoms and has been identified as having anti-inflammatory activity.
Rule 3: A compound that contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) attached to an aromatic ring may be capable of acting as BBBP. This is because many drugs and drug candidates contain this functional group and have been shown to have diverse bioactivities. For example, the compound COc1cc(Nc2ccc3nc(N)nc(N)c3c2C)cc(OC)c1OC 0 contains a sulfonyl group and has been investigated for its potential use as an analgesic agent.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-NO2" in a compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This is because nitro compounds tend to have high boiling points and low solubility in water due to their polar nature. Therefore, they do not meet the criteria for being a good candidate for BBBP.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a benzene ring or other aromatic rings, it may not be able to be BBBP. This is because aromatics tend to have higher melting and boiling points than non-aromatics, which makes them less volatile and less likely to evaporate at room temperature.
Rule 3: A compound containing a long chain of carbon atoms without any branches or functional groups may also not be able to be BBBP. Long chains of hydrocarbons typically have high boiling points and low vapor pressures, making them less volatile and less likely to evaporate at room temperature.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of bromine atom in the compound makes it more likely to have BBBP property as seen in compounds C1 and F1.
Rule 2: Compounds containing nitrogen atoms in their structure tend to have higher chances of having BBBP property as observed in compounds A1, B1, D1, E1, G1, H1, I1, J1, K1, L1, M1, N1, O1, P1, Q1, R1, S1, T1, U1, V1, W1, X1, Y1, Z1, AA1, AB1, AC1, AD1, AE1, AF1, AG1, AH1, AI1, AJ1, AK1, AL1, AM1, AN1, AO1, AP1, AQ1, AR1, AS1, AT1, AU1, AV1, AW1, AX1,AY1,AZ1,BA1,BB1,BC1,BD1,BE1,BF1,BG1,BH1,BI1,BJ1,BK1,BL1,BM1,BN1,BO1,BP1,BQ1,BR1,BS1,BT1,BU1,BV1,BW1, BX1,BY1,BZ1,CA1,CB1,CC1,CD1,CE1,CF1,CG1,CH1,CI1,CJ1,CK1,CL1,CM1,CN1,CO1,CP1,CQ1,CR1,CS1,CT1,CU1,CV1,CW1,CX1,CY1,CZ1,DA1,DB1,DC1,DD1,DE1,DF1,DG1,DH1,DI1,DJ1,DK1,DL1,DM1,DN1,DO1,DP1,DQ1,DR1,DS1,DT1,DU1,DV1,

================================

Rule 1: The presence of bromine in the compound makes it less likely to have the property of being BBBP. This rule can be inferred from the fact that compounds containing bromine are often used as drugs and their biological activity may depend on the position of the halogen atom within the molecule. However, this rule does not apply to all cases since some molecules with bromine atoms exhibit high bioactivity.
Rule 2: If the compound contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to possess the property of being BBBP. Nitro groups are known for their ability to interact with biological systems through hydrogen bonding or electron transfer reactions. Therefore, they can enhance the potency of bioactive compounds by increasing their lipophilicity or facilitating interactions with target proteins.
Rule 3: Compounds with a carbonyl group (-C=O) adjacent to a double bond (-C=C-) tend to be non-polar and hydrophobic. Such structures are commonly found in lipids and other hydrophobic biomolecules such as steroids. Since these types of compounds are typically associated with membrane permeability and cell uptake, they could potentially affect the bioavailability and efficacy of drug candidates.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a benzene ring in the molecular structure and no other functional groups present, then the compound may have the property of being BBBP. For example, molecules such as CC(CN(C)C)CN1c2ccccc2CCc3ccccc13, C1=C(C(=N[N]1CCCN(C)C)C2=CC=CC=C2)C3=CC=CC=C3, O=C1CCC(=O)N1CC1CCC2CN(CCN2C1)c1ncccn1, etc. belong to this category.
Rule 2: If there exist two or more aromatic rings in the molecular structure and no other functional groups present, then the compound may also have the property of being BBBP. For instance, molecules like CCC[N+](C)(CC)CCOC(=O)C1c2ccccc2Oc3ccccc13, c1c(nccc1)CCN(C)C, C1=CC(=CC4=C1N2C(=NC(/C2=O)=C\N3CCN(C)CC3)CN=C4C5=C(C=CC=C5)Cl)[N+](=O)[O-], etc. fall under this category.
Rule 3: If there exists a carbonyl group (C=O) in the molecular structure along with one or more aromatic rings, then the compound may possess the property of being BBBP. Examples include C(C(C1CCCCC1)OC(N)=O)C, COC(CN(CC)CC)=O, C1=C(Br)C=CC2=C1C(=NCC(N2C)COC)C3=CC=CC=C3Cl, C(C(C4(C3(C(C2C(

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-CCl" in the compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This is because compounds containing this functional group have been shown to have adverse effects on aquatic organisms and are therefore considered toxic.
Rule 2: If the compound contains the functional group "-NO2" or "-NH2", then it may not be able to bind to the target protein responsible for binding BBBP molecules. This is because these groups are known to disrupt the normal functioning of proteins by altering their structure and stability.
Rule 3: Compounds containing aromatic rings such as benzene or pyridine may also not be able to bind to the target protein due to their hydrophobic nature. These rings tend to repel water molecules and can interfere with the interaction between the ligand and its receptor.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group NCC1(CCCCC1) in the compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP as this functional group is associated with non-polar compounds and does not have any polar bonds or groups which are present in BBBP molecules. Therefore, the first three compounds in the dataset do not contain this functional group and hence they can be predicted to be BBBP.
Rule 2: If the compound contains the functional group CNC[C@H](O)c1ccc(O)c(O)c1, then it cannot be BBBP because this functional group is also associated with non-polar compounds like alkanes. Hence, the fourth compound in the dataset does not contain this functional group and therefore can be predicted to be BBBP.
Rule 3: If the compound has a halogen atom such as chlorine attached to a benzene ring, i.e. C1=CC(=CC=C1C2(C(CC(C)C)N(C)C)CCC2)Cl, then it cannot be BBBP due to the presence of the electronegative halogen atom which makes the compound more polar than other aromatic compounds like BBBP. Thus, the fifth compound in the dataset satisfies this rule and hence cannot be BBBP.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a benzene ring in the structure, then it cannot be BBBP.
Explanation: The compound BBBP has been identified as a potent and selective inhibitor for the enzyme carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) which plays a crucial role in regulating pH balance within cells. However, compounds containing a benzene ring have been found to bind weakly or not at all to CAII due to their hydrophobic nature, making them unsuitable candidates for inhibiting this enzyme. Therefore, any compound containing a benzene ring should be labeled as "0" instead of "1" when predicting its ability to be BBBP.
Rule 2: If there exist two chlorine atoms on the same carbon atom, then it must be labeled as "1" since they increase the hydrophobicity of the compound and may enhance its binding affinity towards CAII.
Explanation: Chlorine is a halogen atom that is commonly used in drug design because of its ability to increase the lipophilicity of a compound, allowing it to cross cell membranes more easily. Compounds containing two chlorine atoms on the same carbon atom have been shown to exhibit higher inhibitory activity against CAII compared to those without such substituents. Therefore, these compounds should be labeled as "1" when predicting their ability to be BBBP.
Rule 3: If there exists a nitro group (-NO2) in the structure, then it must be labeled as "1" since it is known to interact with amino acid residues in the active site of CAII and contribute significantly to the inhibition of this enzyme.
Explanation: Nitro groups are electron-withdrawing groups that can increase the acidity of adjacent protons, leading to stronger interactions with positively charged amino acids in the active site of CAII. Compounds containing nitro groups have been reported to show high potency and selectivity towards CAII, making them suitable candidates for being BBBP.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-C#CC-" in the molecular structure indicates that the compound may have the property of being BBBP. This rule applies to molecules such as C1 and O=C2\C(=C1\OC=NN1)C=CC=C2.
Rule 2: If there exists a benzene ring or other aromatic rings in the molecular structure, then the compound may also possess the characteristic of being BBBP. For example, CC1=C(CCN2CCC(CC2)c3noc4cc(F)ccc34)C(=O)N5CCCCC5=N1 and CCC(=O)O[C@H]1[C@@H](C)[C@@H](C)OC(=O)C(C)[C@@H](O[C@H]2C[C@H](OC)[C@@H](OC(=O)CC)[C@H](C)O2)[C@H](C)[C@@H](O[C@@H]3O[C@H](C)C[C@@H]([C@H]3O)N(C)C)C(C)C[C@@]4(CO4)C(=O)[C@@H]1C.
Rule 3: A molecule containing nitrogen atoms in its structure may exhibit the feature of being BBBP. Examples include [C@H](N)(C(OCCOC[N]1C2=C(N=C1)C(=O)N=C(N2)N)=O)C(C)C, CCC(=O)O[C@H]1[C@@H](C)[C@@H](C)OC(=O)C

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a bromine atom in the molecular structure and no other halogen atoms, then the compound has a high chance of being BBBP.
Explanation: The presence of a bromine atom in the molecular structure indicates that the compound may have a similar chemical behavior as BBBP due to their similar atomic size and electronegativity. However, the absence of any other halogen atoms suggests that the compound may have unique characteristics compared to BBBP. Therefore, further analysis would be required to determine whether or not this compound is indeed BBBP.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a nitrogen-containing ring and a chlorine atom, then the compound has a low chance of being BBBP.
Explanation: Nitrogen-containing rings are commonly found in many pharmaceutical compounds, including benzodiazepines and quinolones. These types of structures often have specific biological activities that differ from those of BBBP. Additionally, the presence of a chlorine atom in the molecular structure may indicate that the compound has different physical and chemical properties than BBBP.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond system, then the compound has a moderate chance of being BBBP.
Explanation: Carbonyl groups and conjugated double bond systems are common functional groups present in many organic molecules, including benzene and naphthalene. These structural features may contribute to the overall electronic and steric properties of the compound, which could affect its ability to interact with biological targets like the GABA receptor. Further analysis would be needed to confirm whether or not this compound is actually BBBP.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-NOC(=N1)C" in the given SMILES string suggests that this compound may belong to the class of benzimidazole derivatives and could potentially have biological activity as a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor or an anti-inflammatory agent. This functional group is commonly found in drugs such as acetazolamide, methazolamide, and brinzolamide.
Rule 2: The presence of the functional group "-CN1CCCC1" in the second SMILES string indicates that this compound contains a nitrile group which is often used as a bioisostere for carboxylic acids due to their similar chemical reactivity. This functional group has been shown to possess various pharmacological activities including antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer effects.
Rule 3: The third SMILES string contains the functional group "-CCSNC" which is characteristic of thiophene derivatives. Thiophenes are known for their diverse range of biological activities such as antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticonvulsant effects.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a benzene ring present in the structure, then it has a high probability of being BBBP.
Rule 2: If there is a nitro group attached to the carbon chain, then it may not be BBBP.
Rule 3: If there is a fluorine atom present on the aromatic ring or adjacent to the double bond, then it has a higher chance of being BBBP.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-COOH" in the compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP as it is known to cause irritation and toxicity when exposed to the skin or eyes. Therefore, compounds containing this functional group should be labeled as 0 instead of 1 for being BBBP.
Rule 2: If the compound contains a benzene ring, it may indicate that it has potential to be BBBP due to its ability to absorb UV radiation which can lead to skin damage and cancer. However, other factors such as the position and number of substituents on the benzene ring also play a role in determining whether it will be harmful or not. Therefore, compounds containing a benzene ring should still be evaluated carefully before making any conclusions about their potential to be BBBP.
Rule 3: Compounds containing sulfur atoms tend to have higher boiling points than those without them because of the stronger intermolecular forces between molecules. This property could potentially make these compounds more likely to be volatile and irritate the skin upon exposure. Therefore, compounds containing sulfur atoms should be labeled as 0 instead of 1 for being BBBP until further evaluation is conducted.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-NHC(=O)NH-" in the molecular structure indicates that it may have the property of being BBBP. This rule applies to molecules 6 and 7.
Rule 2: If there exists a benzene ring in the molecular structure, then it may indicate that it cannot be BBBP. This rule applies to molecules 8 and 9.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may suggest that it has the potential to be BBBP. This rule applies to molecule 10.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of bromine atom in the compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This rule is based on the fact that compounds containing bromine atoms have been found to exhibit toxic effects and may interfere with normal biological processes. Therefore, they are generally avoided in drug design.
Rule 2: If the compound contains a sodium ion or a chloride ion, then it cannot be BBBP. These ions are often present in natural products but are not commonly used in synthetic drugs due to their potential toxicity.
Rule 3: If the compound has a structure similar to that of known BBBP molecules, then it could potentially be BBBP. However, this rule should only be applied after careful analysis of the chemical structure and its interactions with the target protein. It is important to note that predicting whether a compound is BBBP solely based on its structure is challenging and requires extensive research and testing.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-C(=O)NNC(=O)-" in a compound indicates that it may have the property of being BBBP. This rule applies to compounds #6 and #8.
Rule 2: If a compound contains two or more benzene rings connected by single bonds, then it may not be able to be BBBP. This rule applies to compound #9.
Rule 3: A compound containing a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) attached to an aromatic ring may not be able to be BBBP. This rule applies to compound #7.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a benzene ring in the molecular structure and no other functional groups present, then the compound has a high probability of being BBBP. For example, molecules like C1=CC(=CC=C1N2CCN(CCCS(=O)(=O)Oc3ccccc3)CC2)F and CC(=O)ONC(C)(C)C have a benzene ring and no other functional group, so they are likely to be BBBP.
Rule 2: If there exist two or more benzene rings in the molecular structure and no other functional groups present, then the compound has a moderate probability of being BBBP. For instance, molecules such as CN(C)CCCN2c1ccccc1C(=Nc3cccnc23)c4ccccc4 and CCC(CCl)CHC(=O)NH have two benzene rings and no other functional group, so they have a moderate chance of being BBBP.
Rule 3: If there exists a nitrogen-containing heterocycle in the molecular structure along with one or more benzene rings, then the compound has a low probability of being BBBP. For example, molecules like CNC(=O)C[C@H](NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(I)cc1)C(=O)N1CCN(CCCC(C2=CC=C(F)C=C2)=O)CC1 do not contain any benzene ring but have a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, making them less likely to be BBBP.

================================
