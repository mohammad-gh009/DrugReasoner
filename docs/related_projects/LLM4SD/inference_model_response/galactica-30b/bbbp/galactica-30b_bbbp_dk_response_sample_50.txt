Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-COOH" in the molecular structure may indicate that the compound can be BBBP. This rule can be applied to molecules such as C1 and G1 where the "-COOH" group is present.
Rule 2: If there is no "-COOH" group but there is a "-NO2" group in the molecular structure, then the compound cannot be BBBP. This rule can be applied to molecules such as B1 and D1 where the "-NO2" group is present.
Rule 3: If both the "-COOH" and "-NO2" groups are absent from the molecular structure, then the compound's ability to be BBBP depends on other factors such as its size, shape, and polarity. This rule can be applied to molecules such as A1, E1, F1, H1, I1, J1, K1, L1, M1, N1, O1, P1, Q1, R1, S1, T1, U1, V1, W1, X1, Y1, Z1, AA1, AB1, AC1, AD1, AE1, AF1, AG1, AH1, AI1, AJ1, AK1, AL1, AM1, AN1, AO1, AP1, AQ1, AR1, AS1, AT1, AU1, AV1, AW1, AX1,AY1,AZ1,BA1,BB1,BC1,BD1,BE1,BF1,BG1,BH1,BI1,BJ1,BK1,BL1,BM1,BN1,BO1,BP1,BQ1,BR1,BS1,BT1,BU1,BV1,BW1, BX1,BY1,BZ1,CA1,CB1,CC1,CD1,CE1,CF1

================================

Rule 1: If the compound has a benzene ring and two chlorine atoms attached to it, then it cannot be BBBP. This is because the presence of halogen atoms like chlorine in a chemical structure often leads to decreased lipophilicity which affects its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. The compound C1=CC(=CC=C1C(CC(C)(C)O)(C)O)Cl 1 violates this rule as it contains a benzene ring with two chlorine atoms attached to it.
Rule 2: If the compound has a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a five-membered heterocycle such as pyrrole or furan, then it may not be able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier due to its polar nature. The compound CN1C(=O)N(C)c2ncn(CCNCC(O)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3)c2C1=O 0 violates this rule since it has a nitro group attached to a five-membered heterocyclic ring.
Rule 3: If the compound has a carbonyl group (-C=O) adjacent to a double bond, then it may not be able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier due to its high polarity. The compound CCC(C)(C)C 1 violates this rule as it has a carbonyl group next to a double bond.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of bromine atom in the molecular structure indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This rule is based on the fact that molecules containing bromine atoms have high lipophilicity and tend to accumulate in adipose tissues rather than in blood plasma or brain tissue where BBBP occurs. Therefore, such compounds may not cross the blood-brain barrier effectively enough to exhibit central nervous system activity.
Rule 2: If the compound contains a cyano group (-CN), it cannot be BBBP. Cyano groups are highly polar and can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, which makes them more soluble in aqueous solutions compared to nonpolar organic solvents like benzene or hexane. As a result, these compounds may not penetrate cell membranes easily and may not reach their target sites within the body.
Rule 3: Compounds having a carbonyl group (-C=O) adjacent to a nitrogen atom in their molecular structures may not be able to bind to the benzodiazepine receptor site due to steric hindrance caused by the bulky nature of the substituent attached to the nitrogen atom. Such substituents include alkyl or aryl groups, which can interfere with the binding of the drug to its target protein.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "C=C" in the molecular structure indicates that the compound may have the property of being BBBP. This rule applies to molecules such as "C1=NN=C(CS)C1" and "C1=ON=C(OS)C1".
Rule 2: If there is a halogen atom present in the molecular structure, then the compound may not be able to be BBBP. For example, in the molecule "C1=CCl=C(Br)C1", the bromine atom makes it less likely for this compound to be BBBP.
Rule 3: If the molecular formula contains nitrogen atoms, then the compound may also be unable to be BBBP. An example of this is the molecule "C1=NOC(Oc2nnc(cn2)/C=C/c2ccc(nc(=O)NS(=O)(=O)c3ccccc3)o2)C1".

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-COC(Cn2ccnc2)c3ccc(Cl)cc3Cl" in the compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This is because this functional group contains chlorine atoms which are known to have a negative effect on blood-brain barrier penetration. Therefore, compounds containing this functional group may not be able to cross the blood-brain barrier and reach their target sites within the brain.
Rule 2: The absence of the functional group "-COC(Cn2ccnc2)c3ccc(Cl)cc3Cl" in the compound does not necessarily mean that it can be BBBP. Other factors such as molecular weight, lipophilicity, hydrogen bonding capacity, and polarity also play important roles in determining whether a compound can penetrate the blood-brain barrier or not.
Rule 3: The compound "O=[P](O)(OCC(Cl)(Cl)Cl)O" has a unique structure consisting of a phosphate group attached to three chlorine atoms. While this structure may suggest that the compound could potentially cross the blood-brain barrier due to its low molecular weight and high lipophilicity, further studies would be needed to determine whether it actually does so.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-C=C-" in the molecular structure indicates that the compound may have the property of being BBBP. This is because the double bond present in this group is responsible for the absorption and emission of light energy when exposed to UV radiation.
Rule 2: If there exists a benzene ring or any other aromatic system in the molecular structure, then it is likely that the compound has the potential to exhibit fluorescence under UV irradiation. Therefore, such compounds could potentially act as blue fluorescent probes.
Rule 3: A conjugated system consisting of alternating single and double bonds, such as in polyenes, can also contribute to the fluorescence behavior of molecules. Compounds containing these types of structures may emit light at different wavelengths depending on their size and shape.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a benzene ring in the molecular structure, then it has a high probability of being BBBP.
Explanation: The first two molecules have a benzene ring and they both have a label of 1 which indicates that they are BBBP.
Rule 2: If there exist halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine in the molecular structure, then it has a low probability of being BBBP.
Explanation: The fifth molecule has three chlorine atoms and it has a label of 0 which indicates that it is not BBBP.
Rule 3: If there exists a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecular structure, then it has a moderate probability of being BBBP.
Explanation: The ninth molecule has a nitro group and it has a label of 1 which indicates that it is BBBP.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-Cl" in the structure of a compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This rule applies to compounds #1 and #2 as they both contain chlorine atoms.
Rule 2: If there is no nitrogen atom present in the structure of a compound, then it cannot be BBBP. This rule applies to compounds #3 and #4 as they do not have any nitrogen atoms.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a benzene ring or a phenyl group, then it cannot be BBBP. This rule applies to compounds #5 and #6 as they both contain benzene rings.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group NC(N)=NC(=O) in the compound indicates that it may have the property of being BBBP. This rule is based on the fact that this functional group is commonly found in compounds that exhibit bioactivity against various biological targets such as kinases and proteases.
Rule 2: If the compound contains the functional group C(N1C(C(C)OC1=O)=O)C=C, then it may possess the ability to act as BBBP. This rule is derived from the observation that many bioactive compounds contain the carbonyl group attached to a carbon atom bonded to two nitrogen atoms.
Rule 3: If the compound has the structure [H+].C1=NC3=C([N]1CCNC(CC2=CC=CC=C2)C)C(=O)N(C(=O)N3C)C.[Cl-], then it may show activity towards BBBP. This rule is based on the fact that organic molecules containing acidic protons and chloride ions often display good solubility in water, which is a desirable characteristic for drugs targeting aqueous environments like the bloodstream or cellular cytoplasm.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-C#N" in the molecular structure indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This is because "-C#N" is a characteristic feature of many explosives and propellants which are typically used for military purposes rather than being benign. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should be labeled as 0 instead of 1.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains any aromatic rings, it should also be labeled as 0 since they are often associated with toxic or carcinogenic properties. Hence, such structures should be avoided when designing new compounds for use in consumer products like cosmetics or food additives.
Rule 3: Molecules having a high degree of symmetry may have a higher likelihood of being BBBP due to their ability to pack efficiently into crystals without creating large voids or defects. However, this rule is more qualitative and requires further investigation before it can be formulated as a definitive rule.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a benzene ring in the molecular structure, then it has a high probability of being BBBP.
Explanation: The first molecule contains a benzene ring and is labeled as 1 which indicates that it is likely to be BBBP. Similarly, molecules 6, 7, 9, 18, 20, and 21 also contain a benzene ring and are all labeled as 1 indicating that they may have similar properties as BBBP.
Rule 2: If there exist halogen atoms such as fluorine or chlorine in the molecular structure, then it has a low probability of being BBBP.
Explanation: Molecules 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 contain halogen atoms and are all labeled as 0 indicating that they do not possess any similarity to BBBP.
Rule 3: If there exists a nitro group in the molecular structure, then it has a moderate probability of being BBBP.
Explanation: Molecule 11 contains a nitro group and is labeled as 1 indicating that it may have some similarities to BBBP. However, this rule should be used cautiously since other factors such as the position and number of nitro groups may affect its overall properties.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a benzene ring in the structure, then it cannot be BBBP.
Explanation: The compound BBBP has been identified as a non-toxic and biodegradable plasticizer used in various applications such as food packaging materials, medical devices, and children's toys. However, compounds containing aromatic rings like benzene have been known for their toxicity and carcinogenicity. Therefore, the presence of a benzene ring in a chemical structure may indicate its potential toxicity or lack of biodegradability, making it less likely to be classified as BBBP.
Rule 2: If the molecular formula contains nitrogen atoms, then it cannot be BBBP.
Explanation: Nitrogen is one of the essential elements required by living organisms for growth and development. It plays a crucial role in forming amino acids, proteins, nucleic acids, and other important biological molecules. Compounds containing nitrogen atoms may exhibit toxic or carcinogenic effects on human health due to their reactivity and ability to form covalent bonds with biomolecules. Therefore, the absence of nitrogen atoms in a chemical structure may suggest its suitability for use as a safe and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional plastics.
Rule 3: If the compound contains chlorine atoms, then it cannot be BBBP.
Explanation: Chlorine is a highly reactive element commonly found in synthetic chemicals used in industrial processes. Exposure to chlorinated compounds through inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact can cause adverse health effects such as respiratory problems, neurological damage, and cancer. Therefore, the inclusion of chlorine atoms in a chemical structure may raise concerns about its safety and environmental impact, making it less likely to be considered as BBBP.

================================

Rule 1: If the compound has a benzene ring and a fluorine atom attached to one of its carbon atoms, then it cannot be BBBP. This rule applies to the first SMILES string in the dataset. The presence of these two functional groups may affect the biological activity of the compound.
Rule 2: If the compound contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it cannot be BBBP. This rule applies to the second SMILES string in the dataset. Nitro groups are known to be toxic and may interfere with the normal functioning of the body.
Rule 3: If the compound contains a cyano group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (-CO-) connected by a single bond, then it cannot be BBBP. This rule applies to the third SMILES string in the dataset. Cyano groups are highly reactive and may interact with other molecules in the body, leading to adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of bromine atom in the compound makes it likely to have BBBP property as shown by compounds C7 and C8.
Rule 2: Compounds containing fluorine atoms may or may not have BBBP property depending on their structure as seen from compounds C9 and C10.
Rule 3: Cyclic compounds tend to have higher chances of having BBBP property compared to acyclic ones as observed for compounds C11 and C12.

================================

Rule 1: If the compound has a benzene ring and a nitrogen atom in its structure, then it may be able to bind to the target protein associated with BBBP. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the compound could interact with the receptor through π-π stacking or hydrogen bonding interactions.
Rule 2: If the compound contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom, then it may also contribute to binding affinity for the target protein associated with BBBP. Chlorine is often used as a bioisostere for other functional groups such as hydroxyl or amino groups, which can enhance the overall polarity and water solubility of the compound. This property can help the drug penetrate the blood-brain barrier more effectively.
Rule 3: If the compound contains a carbonyl group adjacent to a double bond, then it may have some potential to bind to the target protein associated with BBBP. This functional group can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor, which can form favorable interactions with polar residues on the surface of the protein. However, this rule should be applied cautiously because the exact role of this functional group in binding affinity remains unclear.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "C(=O)C#C" in the molecular structure indicates that the compound may have the property of being BBBP. This rule applies to molecules 6 and 7.
Rule 2: If there exists a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine attached to a carbon atom in the molecular structure, then the compound may not be able to be BBBP. This rule applies to molecules 8 and 9.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring, then the compound may not be able to be BBBP. This rule applies to molecule 10.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-NO2" in a compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This is because nitro compounds tend to have high boiling points and low solubility in water due to their polar nature. Therefore, they may not be suitable for use as solvents or reagents in organic synthesis.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a conjugated system of double bonds, such as a phenyl ring attached to an alkene or alkyne, then it may be able to act as a BBBP. Conjugated systems allow for efficient transfer of energy through the molecule, which can lead to a lower boiling point compared to non-conjugated molecules.
Rule 3: Compounds containing halogen atoms, such as chlorine or fluorine, tend to have relatively low boiling points and may be good candidates for use as BBBP. Halogen atoms increase the polarity of a molecule and can enhance intermolecular forces, leading to higher boiling points. However, care should be taken when using these compounds since some halogens can be toxic or reactive under certain conditions.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group CCC(=O) in the molecular structure indicates that it may have the property of being BBBP. This rule applies to molecules 1 and 10.
Rule 2: If there exists a nitrogen atom bonded to three carbon atoms in the molecular structure, then it may possess the characteristic of being BBBP. This rule applies to molecules 2 and 11.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring or a naphthalene ring, then it may exhibit the property of being BBBP. This rule applies to molecules 3 and 12.

================================

Rule 1: If the compound has a benzene ring and a chlorine atom attached to it at position 2 or 6, then it cannot be BBBP. This rule applies to compounds 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115,

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-C#N" in the molecular structure indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This is because "-C#N" is a characteristic feature of many explosives and propellants which are typically not used as blue dyes or pigments.
Rule 2: If there is no nitrogen atom present in the molecular structure, then it may be possible for it to be BBBP. However, this rule alone does not guarantee whether the compound will be able to absorb light at a specific wavelength.
Rule 3: A compound containing conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings may have the ability to absorb light at longer wavelengths than those absorbed by compounds without these features. Therefore, such compounds may be more likely to exhibit blue color.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-CCOC1=CC=CC2=CC=CC=C12" in the molecular structure indicates that the compound may have the property of being BBBP. This rule applies to the first molecule listed in the data set.
Rule 2: If there exists a molecule containing the substructure "C1CNN(C)Cc1cccc(c1)OCCCNc1nc2c(o1)cccc2", then it may possess the characteristic of being BBBP. This rule applies to the second molecule listed in the data set.
Rule 3: A molecule having the structural feature "C1=C(X)C=CX2=C1C(=NCS(=O)N2C)C3=CC=CC=C3" where X is either Cl or Br, suggests that this compound could potentially exhibit the property of being BBBP. This rule applies to the third molecule listed in the data set.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-Cl" in the compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP as chlorine is known to have adverse effects on biological activity and toxicity. Therefore, compounds containing this functional group may not be suitable for drug development.
Rule 2: Compounds having a nitro group (-NO2) or a carbonyl group (>C=O) attached to an aromatic ring may not be able to bind to the target protein due to their electron withdrawing nature which can alter the electronic environment around the binding site. Hence, these types of compounds should be avoided during drug design.
Rule 3: Molecules possessing a heterocyclic ring system such as pyridine, pyrimidine, pyrazole etc. may not be ideal candidates for drug discovery because they often exhibit poor pharmacokinetic profiles including low solubility, high lipophilicity, and metabolic instability. Therefore, medicinal chemists need to carefully consider the structural features of potential lead molecules while designing new drugs.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a benzene ring in the molecular structure and no other functional groups present, then the compound cannot be BBBP. This rule applies to molecules #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25, #26, #27, #28, #29, #30, #31, #32, #33, #34, #35, #36, #37, #38, #39, #40, #41, #42, #43, #44, #45, #46, #47, #48, #49, #50, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #57, #58, #59, #60, #61, #62, #63, #64, #65, #66, #67, #68, #69, #70, #71, #72, #73, #74, #75, #76, #77, #7

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-C(=O)-" in the molecular structure indicates that it may have the property of being BBBP. This rule applies to molecules 6 and 7 as they both contain this functional group. However, it does not apply to all molecules containing this functional group since some may not have the necessary structural features required for BBBP.
Rule 2: If there exists a benzene ring in the molecular structure, then it may indicate that the molecule has the potential to be BBBP. This rule applies to molecules 8 and 9 where one contains a benzene ring while the other does not. Therefore, further analysis would need to be done on these molecules to determine their actual ability to be BBBP.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it may suggest that the molecule cannot be BBBP due to its high reactivity. This rule applies to molecules 10 and 11 which both contain chlorine atoms but only one of them is labeled as BBBP.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of bromine atom in the structure may indicate that the compound has the potential to be BBBP. This rule can be applied to compounds 1 and 6.
Rule 2: If there is a cyano group present in the structure, then it may suggest that the compound cannot be BBBP. This rule can be applied to compound 7.
Rule 3: If the compound contains a carbonyl group, then it may have some potential to be BBBP. However, this rule alone does not guarantee whether or not the compound will be BBBP. This rule can be applied to compounds 8 and 9.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a benzene ring in the structure, then it has a high probability of being BBBP.
Explanation: The first three molecules have a benzene ring and they all have the label 1 which indicates that they are BBBP.
Rule 2: If there exist two chlorine atoms on the same side of the molecule, then it has a low probability of being BBBP.
Explanation: The fifth molecule has two chlorine atoms on one side of the molecule and it has the label 0 which indicates that it is not BBBP.
Rule 3: If there exists a nitrogen atom bonded to at least four other atoms including carbon or hydrogen, then it has a moderate probability of being BBBP.
Explanation: The last five molecules have such a nitrogen atom and they all have the label 1 which indicates that they are BBBP.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-C=C-" in the structure of a compound indicates that it may have the property of being BBBP. This is because compounds containing this functional group tend to have high boiling points due to their strong intermolecular forces such as van der Waals interactions and dipole-dipole interactions.
Rule 2: If a compound contains both nitrogen and oxygen atoms in its structure, it may not be able to be BBBP. This is because the lone pairs of electrons on these atoms can form hydrogen bonds or other types of intermolecular interactions which can lower the boiling point of the compound.
Rule 3: Compounds containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine tend to have low boiling points compared to those without them. This is because the electronegativity of halogens makes them strongly polarizable, leading to stronger intermolecular attractions between molecules.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could help in predicting whether a molecule can be BBBP or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group through a single bond, then it has a high probability of being BBBP. This rule applies to compounds 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms and one sulfur atom, then it may not be BBBP. This rule applies to compounds 3 and 4.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a bromine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a double bond, then it has a low probability of being BBBP. This rule applies to compound 5.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the dataset and may not apply to all molecules. It's always best to consult literature and experts for more accurate predictions.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of bromine atom in the structure indicates that the compound may have the property of being BBBP.
Rule 2: If there is a nitrogen atom present in the ring structure and it is bonded to two carbon atoms, then the compound may have the property of being BBBP.
Rule 3: If the compound has a carbonyl group attached to a double bond, then it may have the property of being BBBP.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-CCClN(C)C" in the structure indicates that the compound cannot be BBBP. This is because this functional group is present in one of the compounds labeled as 0 and absent in all those labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If there is no chlorine atom present in the structure, then the compound may be BBBP. This is because all the compounds labeled as 1 have at least one chlorine atom while none of the compounds labeled as 0 do.
Rule 3: The absence of any nitrogen atoms in the ring system suggests that the compound could potentially be BBBP. However, this rule should be used cautiously since some compounds without nitrogen atoms in their rings still cannot be BBBP.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could help in predicting whether a molecule can be BBBP or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a benzene ring connected to two carbonyl groups through a single bond, then it has a high probability of being BBBP. This rule applies to compounds 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97,

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a benzene ring in the molecular structure and it has at least one fluorine atom attached to it, then the molecule is likely to have the property of being BBBP. This rule is based on the fact that fluorinated benzenes have been shown to exhibit high boiling points due to their strong intermolecular forces such as dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and a double bond between two carbon atoms, then the molecule may or may not be BBBP depending on other factors such as the presence of other functional groups and the overall shape of the molecule. However, if the molecule contains both a carbonyl group and a triple bond between two carbon atoms, then it is more likely to be BBBP because the triple bond increases the strength of the molecule's intermolecular forces.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring such as pyridine or pyrimidine, then the molecule is unlikely to be BBBP since these rings tend to have lower boiling points than other types of organic compounds.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of chlorine atom in the structure may indicate that it cannot be BBBP as it is known to increase lipophilicity and decrease water solubility which affects its absorption and distribution characteristics. Therefore, molecules without chlorines or with less number of chlorines may have higher chances of being BBBP.
Rule 2: The presence of sulfonyl group (-SO2-) in the structure may also suggest that it cannot be BBBP as it is known to cause toxicity due to its electrophilic nature. Therefore, molecules without sulfonyl groups or with less number of sulfonyl groups may have higher chances of being BBBP.
Rule 3: The presence of carbonyl group (-C=O) in the structure may suggest that it could potentially be BBBP but further analysis is required to determine whether it meets all the criteria for being considered as such. It is important to consider other factors such as molecular weight, hydrogen bonding potential, polarity, and charge state when predicting the biological activity of a compound.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-CCCNCCS[P](O)(O)=O" in a compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This is because this functional group contains sulfur and phosphorus which are not present in any of the compounds listed as having label 1.
Rule 2: If a compound has a benzene ring attached to a carbon atom bonded to two nitrogen atoms, then it cannot be BBBP. This is because all the compounds listed as having label 1 do not have such a structure.
Rule 3: A compound containing the functional group "-CCONHC(=O)" may or may not be BBBP depending on its other structural features. However, none of the compounds listed as having label 1 contain this functional group.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-NO2" in a compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This is because nitro compounds are known for their explosive nature and may not be suitable for use as drugs.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, it cannot be BBBP due to its high reactivity and potential toxicity.
Rule 3: A compound containing a conjugated system of double bonds between two aromatic rings may be able to act as a BBBP. However, this rule should be used cautiously since other factors such as solubility and stability must also be considered when predicting drug activity.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-COCH3" in the molecular structure indicates that the compound cannot be BBBP. This is because this functional group is present in many non-polar compounds such as alkanes and alkenes which do not have any polar bonds or hydrogen bond donors. Therefore, they do not dissolve well in water.
Rule 2: If there is a double bond between two carbon atoms in the molecular structure, then the compound may be able to be BBBP. This is because double bonds increase the polarity of the molecule due to the presence of partial charges on the carbon atoms. Polar molecules tend to dissolve better in water than non-polar ones.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains aromatic rings, then the compound may also be able to be BBBP. Aromatic rings are composed of six carbon atoms arranged in a ring shape with alternating single and double bonds. They have a planar conformation and are more stable than aliphatic rings due to their resonance structures. These characteristics make them more polarizable and therefore more soluble in water.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a benzene ring in the structure of the compound, then it has a high probability of being BBBP.
Explanation: The first two compounds have a benzene ring and they both have label 1 which indicates that they are BBBP. On the other hand, the third compound does not have a benzene ring but still has label 1 indicating that it is also likely to be BBBP. Therefore, we cannot conclude that having a benzene ring is a necessary condition for being BBBP as there may exist other factors that contribute to its activity. However, it seems like a strong indicator based on these examples.
Rule 2: If the compound contains a chlorine atom, then it has a higher chance of being BBBP.
Explanation: The fourth and fifth compounds both contain a chlorine atom and they both have label 1 indicating that they are BBBP. This suggests that the presence of a chlorine atom may increase the likelihood of the compound being BBBP. It's worth noting that this rule should only be used as a general guideline since some compounds without chlorine atoms may still be active against BACE1 while others with chlorine atoms may not.
Rule 3: If the compound contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it has a lower chance of being BBBP.
Explanation: The sixth compound contains a nitro group and it has label 0 indicating that it is not BBBP. This suggests that the presence of a nitro group may decrease the likelihood of the compound being BBBP. Again, this rule should only be used as a general guideline since some compounds containing nitro groups may still be active against BACE1 while others without nitro groups may not.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a benzene ring in the molecular structure and no other functional groups present, then the compound may have the property of being BBBP.
Example: C2=C(C1=CC=CC=C1)N=C4C(=C2CCC3CCNCC3)C=CC=C4 1
Rule 2: If there exist a nitrogen atom bonded to three carbon atoms or more, then the compound may not have the property of being BBBP.
Example: n1c(scc1c1ccccc1)CCN 0
Rule 3: If there exists a fluorine atom attached to one of the aromatic rings, then the compound may have the property of being BBBP.
Example: C1=C(C(F)(F)F)C=CC(=C1)C(=N/OCCN)/CCCCOC.O=C(O)\C=C/C(=O)O 1

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a benzene ring in the molecular structure and no other functional groups present, then the compound cannot be BBBP.
Explanation: The presence of a benzene ring is a characteristic feature of many bioactive compounds but does not necessarily imply bioactivity towards a specific target such as BACE1. Therefore, the absence of any other functional group makes it less likely for this compound to exhibit BACE1 inhibitory activity.
Rule 2: If there exist two or more nitrogen atoms in the molecular structure, then the compound may be able to bind to BACE1 active site and act as a BACE1 inhibitor.
Explanation: Nitrogen atoms are known to form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues in protein binding sites, which can contribute to ligand-protein interactions. Therefore, the presence of multiple nitrogen atoms in the molecular structure increases the likelihood of BACE1 inhibition.
Rule 3: If there exists a carbonyl group adjacent to a double bond in the molecular structure, then the compound may be able to interact with the catalytic aspartic acid residue in the BACE1 active site through a hydrogen bond.
Explanation: Carbonyl groups are known to form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues in protein binding sites, and the proximity of a double bond to the carbonyl group can enhance its ability to form hydrogen bonds. Therefore, the presence of a carbonyl group adjacent to a double bond in the molecular structure increases the likelihood of BACE1 inhibition.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a benzene ring in the molecular structure and it is connected to another aromatic system through a single bond or a double bond, then the molecule may have the property of being BBBP. For example, molecules 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 contain a benzene ring and they all have the potential to be BBBP.
Rule 2: If there exist two or more nitrogen atoms in the molecular structure, then the molecule may not have the property of being BBBP. For instance, molecules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 do not have any nitrogen atom present in their structures and hence cannot be BBBP.
Rule 3: If there exists a chlorine atom in the molecular structure, then the molecule may not have the property of being BBBP. For example, molecules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 do not have any chlorine atom present in their structures and hence cannot be BBBP.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-C(=O)-" in the molecular structure indicates that it may belong to the class of compounds known as "ketones" which includes molecules such as acetone and butanone. Ketones have been shown to exhibit biological activity against various diseases including cancer and inflammation. Therefore, the presence of this functional group in the given SMILES string suggests that it could potentially possess similar medicinal properties.
Rule 2: The presence of the "-NO2" group in the molecular structure suggests that it belongs to the class of compounds called "nitro compounds" which are known for their explosive nature. However, some nitro compounds also display anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities. Therefore, the absence of any reported adverse effects associated with these compounds suggests that they might be safe to use under appropriate conditions.
Rule 3: The presence of the "-SCN" group in the molecular structure suggests that it belongs to the class of compounds called "thiols" or "mercaptans" which are known for their pungent odor and ability to react with other substances. Thiols are commonly used in the production of rubber and other materials.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-CCl" in the compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This is because compounds containing this functional group have been shown to have adverse effects on aquatic organisms and are therefore considered toxic. Compounds without this functional group may still be toxic but are less likely to exhibit the same level of toxicity as those with it.
Rule 2: If the compound contains a nitrogen atom bonded to three carbon atoms, then it cannot be BBBP. This is because such a structure is characteristic of many pesticides and other chemicals used for pest control purposes. These types of compounds are designed to interfere with the growth or reproduction of pests and are often highly toxic to non-target species like fish.
Rule 3: If the compound has a benzene ring attached to it through a single bond, then it cannot be BBBP. Benzene rings are known to be carcinogenic and are often found in pollutants and other environmental contaminants. Therefore, compounds containing these structures are more likely to be harmful to living organisms than those without them.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of bromine atoms in the molecular structure indicates that it may have the property of being BBBP. This rule applies to molecules such as BrCC(O)(Br)Br and C1=CC=CC=C1CNC(CCCl)=O.
Rule 2: If there is a cyano group present in the molecular structure, then it may not be able to be BBBP. This rule applies to molecules such as N1(c2c(Sc3c1cccc3)ccc(c2)Cl)CCCN and Nc1ccc(C(O)=O)c(O)c1.
Rule 3: If there is a carbonyl group present in the molecular structure, then it may or may not be able to be BBBP depending on other factors such as the position of the double bond and the type of substituent attached to the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group. This rule applies to molecules such as NNC(=O)c1ccncc1 and O=C2C1=C(CNCC1)ON2.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-SCN" in the compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This is because compounds containing this functional group have been shown to cause reproductive toxicity and developmental abnormalities in animals. Therefore, any compound containing this functional group should be labeled as 0 instead of 1 for being BBBP.
Rule 2: If the compound contains a benzene ring fused to a five-membered heterocycle such as thiophene or pyrrole, then it may be able to bind to the cannabinoid receptor and act as a cannabinoid agonist. Such compounds would need to be tested experimentally to determine their ability to bind to the cannabinoid receptor and elicit a biological effect. However, based on structural similarity alone, these types of compounds could potentially be labeled as 1 for being BBBP.
Rule 3: Compounds containing a benzimidazole core structure have been found to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). Some examples of compounds containing a benzimidazole core structure include indomethacin and nimesulide, which are commonly used as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Based on this information, compounds containing a benzimidazole core structure could potentially be labeled as 1 for being BBBP due to their potential therapeutic use.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of bromine atom and carbonyl group in the compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This rule applies to compounds 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106,

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-CN" in the structure of a compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This is because compounds containing this functional group have a high boiling point and low solubility in water due to their polar nature. Therefore, they do not meet the criteria for being classified as BBBP.
Rule 2: If a compound contains both aromatic rings and halogen atoms such as fluorine or chlorine, it may be able to be BBBP. Halogen atoms increase the polarity of molecules and can enhance their ability to dissolve in water. Additionally, some studies suggest that fluorinated compounds tend to have lower melting points than non-fluorinated ones, which could contribute to their higher volatility and lower boiling points.
Rule 3: Compounds containing conjugated double bonds and carbonyl groups such as aldehydes or ketones often have relatively low boiling points compared to other organic compounds. They also tend to be highly soluble in water due to their polar nature. Therefore, these types of compounds may be more likely to be classified as BBBP.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-CN" in a compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This is because compounds containing this functional group have a strong dipole moment and tend to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, which makes them less hydrophobic than other types of compounds. Therefore, they do not dissolve well in nonpolar solvents like benzene or hexane.
Rule 2: If a compound contains two phenyl rings connected by a single bond, it may be able to act as a BBBP. Phenyl groups are known for their hydrophobicity due to their lack of polar functional groups. Therefore, when two phenyl rings are connected together, they can create a more hydrophobic region within the compound.
Rule 3: Compounds containing conjugated double bonds between carbon atoms may also be able to act as BBBP. Conjugated double bonds increase the overall polarity of the compound, making it easier to dissolve in nonpolar solvents like benzene or hexane. However, too many conjugated double bonds can make the compound too polar and hydrophilic, preventing it from dissolving in nonpolar solvents.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the benzene ring in the structure may indicate that the compound can be BBBP. This rule applies to molecules such as CNCCCC1c2ccccc2C=Cc3ccccc13 and CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2.
Rule 2: If there is a halogen atom present in the structure, it may indicate that the compound cannot be BBBP. This rule applies to molecules such as C1=CC(=CC3=C1N(C2=NC(=O)CO2)CCN=C3C4=CC=CC=C4Cl)Cl and c1cc(Br)ccc1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a functional group such as -COOH or -CONH-, it may indicate that the compound cannot be BBBP. This rule applies to molecules such as CC(C(COC(N)=O)(C(CC)C)C)OC(NC(C)C)=O and NC(=N)c1ccc(o1)c2ccccc2N(=O)=O.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-CCONHC-" in a compound indicates that it cannot be BBBP. This rule applies to compounds 9 and 10.
Rule 2: If a compound contains two or more benzene rings connected by a single bond, then it cannot be BBBP. This rule applies to compound 12.
Rule 3: A compound containing a chlorine atom attached to one end of a carbon chain and a nitrogen atom at the other end cannot be BBBP. This rule applies to compound 13.

================================

Rule 1: If the compound has a benzene ring and a chlorine atom attached to it, then it cannot be BBBP. This is because benzenes are known to have a high boiling point due to their strong intermolecular forces, which makes them difficult to vaporize at low temperatures. Chlorine atoms also increase the molecular weight and size of the compound, making it more difficult for it to evaporate. Therefore, compounds like CCC(=C)C(=O)c1ccc(OCC(O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl and ClC(Cl)Cl would not be able to form a gas phase under standard conditions and hence cannot be classified as BBBP.
Rule 2: If the compound contains a nitrogen-containing functional group such as an amide or an imine, then it may not be BBBP. Nitrogen-containing groups tend to have higher boiling points than non-nitrogen containing ones due to their polar nature and stronger intermolecular interactions. For example, C1=C(C(=NN=C1C2=CC=CC=C2)NCCN3CCOCC3)C and N[S](=O)(=O)c1cc2c(NCN[S]2(=O)=O)cc1C(F)(F)F contain imine and sulfonamide groups respectively, and they both have relatively high boiling points compared to other compounds in the dataset. Hence, these two compounds do not meet the criteria for being considered as BBBP.
Rule 3: If the compound has a long carbon chain with multiple double bonds, then it may not be BBBP. Compounds like CCNC(=NC#N)NCCSCc1c(cccn1)Br and CNCCCN1c2ccccc2CCc3ccccc13 have long carbon chains with multiple double bonds, and they both have relatively high boiling points compared to other compounds in the dataset. These types of structures make the molecules more rigid and less volatile, leading to higher boiling points.
