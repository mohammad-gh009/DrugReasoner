Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen or nitrogen in a molecule tends to decrease its εHOMO value. For example, the first four molecules in the table have relatively low εHOMO values ranging from -6.503521 eV to -6.985163 eV due to the presence of oxygen or nitrogen atoms. On the other hand, the last six molecules in the table do not contain any oxygen or nitrogen atoms and have higher εHOMO values ranging from -5.053154 eV to -7.771572 eV.
2. Rule 2: The conjugation of π-bonds in a molecule also affects its εHOMO value. Molecules with conjugated π-bonds tend to have lower εHOMO values than those without them. For instance, the fifth molecule in the table has two conjugated double bonds between carbon atoms, which results in a very low εHOMO value of -6.674953 eV. In contrast, the tenth molecule does not have any conjugated π-bonds, resulting in a much higher εHOMO value of -5.834121 eV.
3. Rule 3: The presence of heteroatoms such as sulfur or phosphorus in a molecule may increase its εHOMO value if they are part

================================

Step 1: Analyze the given data and identify any patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their respective εHOMO values.
Step 2: Based on your analysis, formulate three rules that can be used to predict the εHOMO value of a new molecule based on its structure.
Rule 1: The presence of electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyls, nitro groups, and halogens tends to decrease the εHOMO value of a molecule. For example, the εHOMO value of CO[C@]12[C@@H]3OC[C@H]1O[C@@H]32 is lower than that of C[C@@H]1[C@H](C)[C@@H]1OCCO due to the presence of two carbonyl groups in the former.
Rule 2: The presence of electron-donating groups such as alkyl groups and amines tends to increase the εHOMO value of a molecule. For instance, the εHOMO value of CC1(C)COC(=O)OC1 is higher than that of N#C[C@H]1OC[C@H]2C[C@@H]1C2 because the former has two alkyl groups while the latter has one nitrile group which is an electron-withdrawing group.
Rule 3: The position and number of functional groups also affect the εHOMO value of a molecule. For example, the εHOMO value

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen or nitrogen in a molecule tends to decrease its εHOMO value. For example, the first four molecules have relatively low εHOMO values ranging from -6.176 eV to -6.446 eV due to the presence of oxygen or nitrogen atoms. On the other hand, the last six molecules do not contain any oxygen or nitrogen atom and have higher εHOMO values between -5.059 eV and -7.197 eV.
2. Rule 2: The conjugation of π-bonds in a molecule also affects its εHOMO value. Molecules with extended conjugated systems tend to have lower εHOMO values compared to those without conjugation. For instance, the fifth molecule has two double bonds connected by a single bond which creates a conjugated system resulting in a low εHOMO value of -6.840 eV. In contrast, the tenth molecule does not have any conjugated system and has a high εHOMO value of -5.059 eV.
3. Rule 3: The position of substituents in a molecule can also affect its εHOMO value. If a substituent is attached to a carbon atom that is part of a conjugated system, it can alter the electronic distribution and change the εHOMO value. For example, the sixth molecule has a carbonyl

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains an amine group (-NH2) or an amide group (-CONH), it tends to have a higher εHOMO value compared to other types of functional groups. For example, the first two molecules in the table have an amine group and they have relatively high εHOMO values of -7.164758 eV and -6.770193 eV respectively. Similarly, the third molecule has an amide group and its εHOMO value is -6.832779 eV.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (>C=O), it tends to have a lower εHOMO value compared to other types of functional groups. For instance, the last four molecules in the table contain a carbonyl group and they have relatively low εHOMO values ranging from -5.039549 eV to -7.251834 eV.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, it tends to have a higher εHOMO value due to increased delocalization of electrons. For example, the fifth molecule has a conjugated system of double bonds between the carbon atoms C1, C2, C3, and O4, which results in a high εHOMO value of -6.084466 eV

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Rule 1: The presence of electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyl (C=O) or cyano (C#N) in a molecule tends to decrease its εHOMO value. For example, the first molecule has two C=O groups and its εHOMO value is -7.4695 eV, which is lower than most other molecules in the dataset. Similarly, the second molecule has one C#N group and its εHOMO value is even lower at -6.7974 eV.
2. Rule 2: The presence of positively charged functional groups such as ammonium (NH3+) or protonated hydroxyl (OH2+) in a molecule tends to increase its εHOMO value. For instance, the third molecule has an NH3+ group and its εHOMO value is -6.7212 eV, which is higher than many neutral molecules in the dataset. Similarly, the sixth molecule has an OH2+ group and its εHOMO value is -6.4790 eV.
3. Rule 3: The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule tends to increase its εHOMO value due to the delocalization of π electrons. For example, the eleventh molecule has an aromatic ring and its εHOMO value is -6

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Rule 1: The presence of electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyl (C=O) or cyano (CN) increases the εHOMO value, while the presence of electron-donating groups such as alkyl or alkoxy decreases it. For example, the εHOMO values for compounds containing C=O or CN groups tend to be higher than those without these groups. On the other hand, the εHOMO values for compounds containing alkyl or alkoxy groups tend to be lower than those without these groups.
2. Rule 2: The position of the substituent group also affects the εHOMO value. For instance, the compound with the nitro group (NO2) attached to the ortho position has a higher εHOMO value compared to when it is attached to the para position due to the resonance effect. Similarly, the compound with the hydroxyl group (OH) attached to the meta position has a slightly higher εHOMO value compared to when it is attached to the ortho or para positions due to the inductive effect.
3. Rule 3: The type of bond between two atoms in a molecule also affects the εHOMO value. For example, the compound with a double bond (C=C) has a higher εHOMO value compared to when there is a single bond (C-C) because the π-electrons in the double bond contribute to the molecular orbital. Additionally, the compound with a triple bond (C≡C) has even higher εHOMO value since the σ-bond contributes significantly to the molecular orbital.

================================

1. Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, and fluorine in a molecule tends to decrease its εHOMO value. This is because these atoms have a higher electron affinity than carbon, which causes them to attract electrons more strongly towards themselves. Therefore, the energy required to remove an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital (εHOMO) decreases. For example, the first four molecules listed in the table contain at least one oxygen atom each, and they all have lower εHOMO values compared to the last three molecules that do not contain any oxygen atoms.
2. Rule 2: The number and position of double bonds or aromatic rings in a molecule also affect its εHOMO value. Generally, increasing the number of double bonds or aromatic rings in a molecule increases its εHOMO value due to increased conjugation and stabilization of the π-electrons. For instance, the fifth molecule has two conjugated double bonds between the carbon atoms, resulting in a higher εHOMO value compared to the other molecules without any double bonds. Similarly, the ninth molecule contains an aromatic ring, which contributes to its high εHOMO value.
3. Rule 3: The type of hybridization of the carbon atoms in a molecule can also influence its εHOMO value. Carbon atoms with sp3 hybridization tend to have lower εHOMO values compared to those with sp2 or sp hybridization. This is because sp3 hybridized carbon atoms have less s-character and are less electronegative than sp2 or sp hybridized carbons. For example, the second molecule has a carbonyl group (C=O), where

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), its εHOMO value will generally be lower than -6.5 eV. This is because the C=O bond has a high electron affinity due to the presence of two highly electronegative oxygen atoms. Therefore, it will tend to attract electrons from other parts of the molecule, resulting in a decrease in the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (εHOMO).
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom, its εHOMO value will depend on whether the nitrogen atom is protonated or not. If the nitrogen atom is protonated, its εHOMO value will typically be higher than -6.2 eV. This is because the positively charged hydrogen atom attached to the nitrogen atom will repel the electrons in the molecule, leading to an increase in the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (εHOMO). On the other hand, if the nitrogen atom is not protonated, its εHOMO value will usually be lower than -6.2 eV.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, its εHOMO value will generally be higher than -5.3 eV. Conjugated systems allow for efficient delocalization of π-electrons across multiple double bonds, which results in a

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen or nitrogen in a molecule tends to decrease its εHOMO value. For example, the first four molecules have relatively low εHOMO values ranging from -5.65 eV to -6.50 eV due to the presence of oxygen or nitrogen atoms. On the other hand, the last six molecules do not contain any oxygen or nitrogen atoms and have higher εHOMO values between -6.73 eV and -7.24 eV.
2. Rule 2: The conjugation of π-bonds in a molecule also affects its εHOMO value. Molecules with conjugated double bonds tend to have lower εHOMO values than those without them. For instance, the fifth molecule has two conjugated double bonds and has one of the lowest εHOMO values at -6.88 eV among all the molecules listed. Similarly, the eleventh molecule contains a conjugated system consisting of a triple bond and a double bond, which results in a slightly lower εHOMO value compared to other non-conjugated molecules.
3. Rule 3: The geometry of a molecule plays a role in determining its εHOMO value. Planar molecules tend to have lower εHOMO values than non-planar ones because planarity allows for better orbital overlap and delocalization of electrons. For example, the third molecule is non-planar and has a high εHOMO value of -

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds or aromatic rings, it tends to have a higher εHOMO value than non-conjugated systems. For example, the first four molecules in the table contain conjugated systems and have relatively high εHOMO values compared to the rest of the molecules.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule has a heteroatom such as nitrogen or oxygen, it tends to have a lower εHOMO value than hydrocarbons. This is because the lone pair of electrons on the heteroatom reduces the electron density in the π-system, which decreases the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital. For instance, the last six molecules in the table contain heteroatoms and have relatively low εHOMO values compared to the other molecules.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule has a carbonyl group (C=O), it tends to have a slightly higher εHOMO value than non-carbonyl compounds. This is due to the increased electron density in the π-system caused by the electronegativity difference between carbon and oxygen. For example, the second molecule in the table has a C=O group and has a slightly higher εHOMO value than the third molecule.

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, it tends to have a lower εHOMO value compared to non-conjugated systems. For example, the first molecule in the table has a εHOMO value of -6.723933 eV, while the last molecule has a much higher εHOMO value of -5.738881 eV despite having similar functional groups. This is because the former has a conjugated system of double bonds, which allows for greater delocalization of electrons and results in a lower energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains heteroatoms such as nitrogen or oxygen, it tends to have a higher εHOMO value due to the presence of lone pairs of electrons. For instance, the third molecule in the table has a high εHOMO value of -7.243671 eV due to the presence of an oxygen atom. Similarly, the sixth molecule has a low εHOMO value of -5.986505 eV since it does not contain any heteroatoms.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains aromatic rings, it tends to have a slightly lower εHOMO value than non-aromatic rings. For example, the twelfth molecule has a relatively low εHOMO value of -6.919855 eV due to the presence of two aromatic rings

================================

Step 1: Analyze the given data and identify any patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their respective εHOMO values.
Step 2: Based on your analysis, formulate three rules that can be used to predict the εHOMO value of a molecule based on its structure.
Rule 1: The presence of electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyl (C=O), cyano (CN), and nitro (NO2) increases the εHOMO value of a molecule. This is because these groups withdraw electrons from the π-system of the molecule, making it more reactive towards nucleophiles.
Example: Molecule C has a higher εHOMO value than molecule A due to the presence of two carbonyl groups.
Rule 2: The presence of electron-donating groups such as alkyl (R), alkoxy (OR), and amino (NR2) decreases the εHOMO value of a molecule. This is because these groups donate electrons to the π-system of the molecule, making it less reactive towards nucleophiles.
Example: Molecule F has a lower εHOMO value than molecule B due to the presence of two methyl groups.
Rule 3: The position of substitution also affects the εHOMO value of a molecule. For example, molecule H has a higher εHOMO value than molecule G due to the presence of the methoxy group at the para position instead of the ortho position.

================================

Step 1: Analyze the given dataset and identify any patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their respective HOMO values.
Step 2: Identify three distinct structural features that appear frequently in the molecules, but not necessarily in all of them. These could be functional groups, ring systems, or other substructures that seem to have a significant impact on the HOMO energy level.
Step 3: Create three separate rules based on these identified structural features and their relationship to the HOMO energy levels. For example:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), its HOMO value will tend to be lower than average.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, such as a phenyl ring or a chain of alternating C=C and C=O bonds, its HOMO value will tend to be higher than average.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), its HOMO value will tend to be significantly lower than average.
These rules can then be used to make predictions about the HOMO energies of new molecules based on their structural features. However, it's important to note that there may be exceptions to each rule, so they should be used cautiously and only as a guide.

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with a higher number of double bonds or triple bonds has a lower εHOMO value due to increased electron delocalization. For example, compare the εHOMO values of N#CCNC1CC(=O)C1 vs COCc1cnoc1C where the former has one more double bond than the latter resulting in a lower εHOMO value. Similarly, c1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a lower εHOMO value compared to C[C@H]1C[C@]1(C)NC(N)=O because it has two more chlorine atoms which increase electron density around the carbon atom.
Rule 2: A molecule with a higher degree of conjugation has a lower εHOMO value. Conjugation occurs when pi orbitals from adjacent double bonds overlap, allowing for greater electron delocalization. For instance, O=C1[CH-][C@H]2[C@@H]3[C@@H]4[C@H]2[N@@H+]4[C@H]13 has a lower εHOMO value compared to CC[C@H]1[C@H]2[C@H](C)[C@@H]3[C@H]2[N@@H+]31 since the former has a higher degree of conjugation between the carbonyl group and the alkene group.
Rule 3: A molecule with a heteroatom such as nitrogen or oxygen has a lower εHOMO value compared to its hydrocarbon analog. This is

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), its εHOMO value will generally be higher than -6 eV. This is because the C=O bond has a high electron density due to the presence of two electronegative oxygen atoms, which makes it easier for electrons to escape from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Therefore, compounds such as COc1ncn[nH]c1=O, N#CCc1nocc1N, O=C1N[C@H]2C[C@H]2N=CO1, CC#CCC1(C)CC1, OC[C@H]1C[C@]2(O)C[C@H]1C2, and CNc1cc(C=O)n[nH]1 have relatively high εHOMO values compared to other compounds in the dataset.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a nitro group (-NO2), its εHOMO value will also be higher than -6 eV. These groups contain highly electronegative nitrogen and oxygen atoms, which make them strong electron-withdrawing groups. As a result, they increase the electron density around the carbon atom and make it easier for electrons to leave the molecule through the HOMO. For example, compounds like Cc1c(N)noc1C#N, C#C[C

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Molecules containing double bonds or aromatic rings tend to have higher εHOMO values than those without such structures. For example, the first four molecules in the table contain either a double bond or an aromatic ring, and they all have relatively high εHOMO values ranging from -6.419166 to -6.982441 eV. On the other hand, the last six molecules do not contain any double bonds or aromatic rings, and they have lower εHOMO values ranging from -5.107577 to -7.303536 eV.
2. The presence of electronegative atoms like oxygen and nitrogen can also affect the εHOMO value. Generally, molecules with more electronegative atoms tend to have lower εHOMO values due to the increased electron density around these atoms. For instance, the fifth molecule in the table has two oxygen atoms and its εHOMO value is -5.151115 eV, which is significantly lower than most of the other molecules. Similarly, the eleventh molecule contains one oxygen atom and its εHOMO value is -6.726655 eV, which is slightly lower than many of the other molecules.
3. The position of functional groups within a molecule can also impact the εHOMO value. In

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with more electronegative atoms has a lower εHOMO value. For example, in the given dataset, compounds containing oxygen have relatively low εHOMO values compared to those without oxygen. This can be attributed to the fact that oxygen has a higher electronegativity than carbon or hydrogen, which causes a decrease in electron density around the molecule's HOMO. Therefore, it can be inferred that the presence of highly electronegative elements in a compound will result in a lower εHOMO value.
Rule 2: A molecule with a conjugated system has a lower εHOMO value due to increased delocalization of π electrons. Conjugation occurs when two or more double bonds are connected through a chain of single bonds, resulting in a longer π bond. This leads to greater overlap between p orbitals, causing a decrease in energy required for the HOMO level. In the given dataset, compounds such as CC#CC#CC#CC#N, C[C@@H](O)[C@]12C[C@](C)(C1)C2, and O=C1[C@@H]2C[C@@H]3O[C@H]1[C@@H]3O2 have multiple double bonds connected by single bonds, resulting in conjugation and a lower εHOMO value.
Rule 3: A molecule with a planar structure has a lower εHOMO value because of increased orbital overlap. Planar structures allow for better orbital overlap between adjacent p orbitals, leading to decreased energy requirements for the HOMO level. In the given dataset, compounds like COC[C@@]1(C)

================================

Step 1: Analyze the given dataset and identify any patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their respective HOMO values.
Step 2: Identify three distinct structural features that appear frequently among the molecules, such as functional groups, ring systems, and hybridization states.
Step 3: Develop three rules based on these identified structural features that can be used to predict the HOMO value of new molecules. For example:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), its HOMO value tends to be lower than -6.5 eV.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, its HOMO value tends to be higher than -5.5 eV.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, its HOMO value tends to be higher than -5.5 eV.

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen or nitrogen in a molecule tends to decrease its εHOMO value. For example, the first four molecules have relatively low εHOMO values ranging from -6.367 eV to -7.412 eV due to the presence of oxygen or nitrogen atoms. On the other hand, the last six molecules have higher εHOMO values between -6.087 eV and -7.526 eV because they do not contain any oxygen or nitrogen atoms.
2. The conjugation of π-bonds in a molecule also affects its εHOMO value. Molecules with conjugated double bonds tend to have lower εHOMO values than those without them. For instance, the fifth molecule has two conjugated double bonds, which results in a significantly lower εHOMO value of -6.236 eV compared to the rest of the molecules. Similarly, the ninth molecule has one conjugated triple bond, resulting in a slightly lower εHOMO value of -6.889 eV.
3. The position of substituents in a molecule can also affect its εHOMO value. In general, electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyl groups (C=O) or nitro groups (NO2) tend to increase the εHOMO value while electron-donating groups like alkyl groups (R) or alkoxy groups (

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Molecules containing conjugated π bonds tend to have lower εHOMO values than those without such bonds. For example, the first four molecules in the table contain conjugated π bonds and have relatively low εHOMO values compared to the rest of the molecules.
2. The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like -NO2 or -COOH tends to decrease the εHOMO value while the presence of electron-donating groups like -OH or -NH2 tends to increase it. This is because electron-withdrawing groups withdraw electrons from the molecule making it harder for them to escape into the vacuum, resulting in a higher energy required to remove an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital. On the other hand, electron-donating groups donate electrons to the molecule making it easier for them to escape into the vacuum, resulting in a lower energy required to remove an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital. For instance, the last two molecules in the table contain strong electron-withdrawing groups (-F and -Cl) and have significantly lower εHOMO values than the others.
3. The position of the substituent group also affects the εHOMO value. For example, the fifth molecule has a nitro group at the para position which is farther away from the carbonyl group than the third molecule where it is at the ortho position. As a result, the former has a slightly higher εHOMO value due to the weaker

================================

Step 1: Analyze the given data and identify any patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their respective εHOMO values.
Step 2: Based on your analysis, formulate three rules that can be used to predict the εHOMO value of a molecule based on its structure.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, it will have a lower εHOMO value compared to non-conjugated systems. This is because conjugation leads to a higher degree of overlap between the p-orbitals, which results in a more stable molecule with a lower energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).
Example: The molecule N#CCC1(C#N)CNC1 has a lower εHOMO value than CC[C@@H](O)CCC(C)C due to the presence of a conjugated system of double bonds.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains heteroatoms such as nitrogen or oxygen, it will have a lower εHOMO value compared to hydrocarbons. This is because the electronegativity of these atoms causes a shift in electron density towards them, resulting in a less stable molecule with a smaller energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO.
Example: The molecule O=C1COC[C@H]1[C@H]1CN1 has a lower εHOMO value than C[C@@H](O)c1c[nH]nn1 due to the presence of an oxygen atom

================================

Step 1: Analyze the given data and identify any patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their corresponding εHOMO values.
Step 2: Based on your analysis, formulate three rules that can be used to predict the εHOMO value of a molecule based on its structure.
Rule 1: The presence of electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyl (C=O), cyano (CN), and nitro (NO2) increases the εHOMO value of a molecule. This is because these groups withdraw electrons from the π-system of the molecule, making it more reactive towards nucleophiles.
Example: Molecule 1 has two C=O groups and has a higher εHOMO value than Molecule 2 which does not have any electron-withdrawing group.
Rule 2: The presence of electron-donating groups such as alkyl (R), alkoxy (OR), and amino (NR2) decreases the εHOMO value of a molecule. This is because these groups donate electrons to the π-system of the molecule, making it less reactive towards nucleophiles.
Example: Molecule 3 has one NH2+ group and has a lower εHOMO value than Molecule 1 which does not have any electron-donating group.
Rule 3: The position of the substituent on the aromatic ring also affects the εHOMO value of a molecule. For example, ortho-substituted compounds tend to have a higher εHOMO value compared to para-substituted compounds due to steric effects.
Example: Molecule 4 has an orthosubstituted phenyl ring and has a higher εHOMO value than Molecule 5 which has a parasubstituted phenyl ring.

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Rule 1: The presence of electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyl (C=O) or cyano (CN) increases the εHOMO value. For example, in compounds CCO[C@H]1CC[C@H]2C[C@H]21 and CC#C[C@H]1[C@H]2CCC[N@H+]21, the presence of two carbonyl groups and one nitrilium ion group respectively increase the εHOMO values compared to other compounds without these functional groups.
2. Rule 2: The presence of electron-donating groups such as alkyl or alkoxy groups decreases the εHOMO value. For instance, in compound O=C1CC(C#CCO)C1, the presence of an alkyl group attached to the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group reduces the εHOMO value due to its electron-donating effect.
3. Rule 3: The conjugation of π-bonds also affects the εHOMO value. In compounds COC(C)(CO)CO and Nc1ccc(C=O)o1, the conjugation of double bonds between the carbonyl group and the adjacent carbon atoms results in higher εHOMO values than those of non-conjugated compounds like C[C@]1(O)[C@@H]2[C@H](CO)O[C@@H

================================

Step 1: Analyze the given data and identify any patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their respective εHOMO values.
Step 2: Based on your analysis, formulate three rules that can be used to predict the εHOMO value of a new molecule based on its structure.
Rule 1: The presence of electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyl (C=O), cyano (CN), and nitro (NO2) increases the εHOMO value of a molecule. This is because these groups withdraw electrons from the π-system of the molecule, making it more reactive towards nucleophiles.
Example: Molecule A has two C=O groups and has a higher εHOMO value than Molecule B which does not have any electron-withdrawing groups.
Rule 2: The presence of electron-donating groups such as alkyl (R), alkoxy (OR), and amino (NR2) decreases the εHOMO value of a molecule. This is because these groups donate electrons to the π-system of the molecule, making it less reactive towards nucleophiles.
Example: Molecule D has one OR group and has a lower εHOMO value than Molecule E which does not have any electron-donating groups.
Rule 3: The position of the substituent on the aromatic ring also affects the εHOMO value of a molecule. For example, ortho-substituted compounds tend to have a higher εHOMO value compared to para-substituted compounds due

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen or nitrogen in a molecule tends to increase its εHOMO value. For example, the first four molecules have relatively high εHOMO values compared to the rest of the molecules due to the presence of oxygen or nitrogen atoms.
2. Rule 2: The conjugation of π bonds in a molecule also affects its εHOMO value. Molecules with extended conjugated systems tend to have higher εHOMO values than those without. For instance, the last two molecules have significantly higher εHOMO values than the other molecules because they contain highly conjugated systems.
3. Rule 3: The geometry of a molecule plays a role in determining its εHOMO value. Planar molecules tend to have lower εHOMO values than nonplanar ones due to the increased overlap between p orbitals in planar structures. For example, the second molecule has a much higher εHOMO value than the third one despite having similar functional groups since the former is nonplanar while the latter is planar.

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Molecules containing double bonds or aromatic rings tend to have higher εHOMO values than those without such structures. For example, CC[C@@]1(OC)COC1=O has two carbonyl groups and one double bond, which contribute to its high εHOMO value of -7.085845 eV. On the other hand, Cc1cc([C@H]2CN2)co1 lacks both double bonds and aromatic rings, resulting in a lower εHOMO value of -5.755208 eV.
2. The presence of electronegative atoms like fluorine can also increase the εHOMO value. FC(F)(F)C1=NCCO1 has two fluorine atoms attached to the carbon atom, leading to a relatively high εHOMO value of -7.333468 eV compared to N#CCNC(=O)CC=O, which does not contain any fluorines.
3. The εHOMO value tends to decrease as the number of conjugated π systems increases. O=C1CC=CCCC1 has only one conjugated system, while CO[C@]1(C)[C@@H]2[C@@H]3N[C@@H]3[C@@H]21 has four separate conjugated systems, resulting in a much lower εHOMO value of 

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a conjugated π system, its εHOMO value will generally be lower than those without such a system. For example, the first four molecules in the table have conjugated π systems, which results in relatively low εHOMO values compared to the other molecules.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule has a heteroatom (such as oxygen or nitrogen) that is bonded to two carbon atoms, it tends to have a higher εHOMO value than those without such a bonding pattern. This is because the lone pair electrons on the heteroatom contribute to the molecular orbital that corresponds to the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level. For instance, the fifth molecule in the table has an oxygen atom that is double-bonded to two carbon atoms, resulting in a high εHOMO value.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), its εHOMO value will tend to be higher than those without such a functional group. This is because the C=O bond has a partial double bond character due to resonance, which increases the electron density around the oxygen atom and contributes to the molecular orbital that corresponds to the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level. For example, the second molecule in the table has a carbonyl group, which results in a high εHOMO value.

================================

To come up with three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the εHOMO value, we can follow these steps:
Step 1: Identify common features among the molecules whose εHOMO values are given in the table.
Step 2: Group the molecules based on those identified features.
Step 3: Calculate the average εHOMO for each group.
Step 4: Compare the averages to identify any significant differences between them.
Step 5: Based on the comparison, formulate three rules that relate the molecular structure to its εHOMO value.
Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be formulated:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), then it has a higher εHOMO value than other molecules without this functional group.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it has a lower εHOMO value than other molecules without this functional group.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it has a slightly lower εHOMO value than other molecules without this functional group.

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. The presence of electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyl (C=O) or cyano (CN) increases the εHOMO value, while the presence of electron-donating groups such as alkyl or alkoxy decreases it. For example, comparing the εHOMO values of compounds CCC[C@@H]1C=CC(=O)C1 (-6.381070) and O=C1[C@@H]2CC=C[C@H]1CC2 (-6.095351) shows that the former has a higher εHOMO value due to the presence of the C=O group which withdraws electrons from the π system. Similarly, comparing the εHOMO values of compounds CC(=O)C[C@H]1COC1=O (-6.898087) and CNC(=O)C(=O)C(C)=O (-6.234128) shows that the latter has a lower εHOMO value due to the presence of the CN group which donates electrons to the π system.
2. The position of the substituent also affects the εHOMO value. For instance, compare the εHOMO values of compounds c1nc2c(

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen or nitrogen in a molecule tends to increase its εHOMO value. For example, the first four molecules in the table have relatively high εHOMO values compared to the rest of the molecules due to the presence of oxygen or nitrogen atoms.
2. Rule 2: The conjugation of π bonds in a molecule also affects its εHOMO value. Molecules with extended conjugated systems tend to have higher εHOMO values than those without such systems. For instance, the fifth molecule has two double bonds connected by a single bond, which creates a conjugated system resulting in a high εHOMO value.
3. Rule 3: The charge on a molecule can also affect its εHOMO value. A positively charged molecule tends to have a lower εHOMO value than a neutral one because the positive charge reduces the electron density around the molecule, making it less reactive towards electrophiles. For example, the last five molecules in the table have either a positive charge or a negatively charged functional group, which results in low εHOMO values.

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Molecules containing electronegative atoms such as oxygen or nitrogen tend to have lower εHOMO values compared to those without them. For example, the first four molecules in the table contain either oxygen or nitrogen, and they all have relatively low εHOMO values ranging from -6.356580 to -7.608303 eV. On the other hand, the last six molecules do not contain any oxygen or nitrogen, and they have higher εHOMO values ranging from -5.904871 to -8.623288 eV.
2. The presence of π-bonds also affects the εHOMO value. Molecules with conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings tend to have lower εHOMO values due to the delocalization of electrons across multiple π-bonds. For instance, the fifth molecule has two conjugated double bonds between carbon and oxygen, which results in a very low εHOMO value of -6.533453 eV. Similarly, the thirteenth molecule contains an aromatic ring, and it has one of the lowest εHOMO values among all the molecules at -8.024637 eV.
3. The charge state of a molecule can also affect its εHOMO value. Molecules with positively charged functional groups such as ammonium or protonated amines tend to have lower εHOMO values than neutral ones. For example, the eleventh molecule

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a double bond between two carbon atoms, it tends to have a higher εHOMO value compared to other types of bonds or structures in the same molecule. For example, C#C[C@@H]1[C@@H]2O[C@@]1(C)C2=O has a εHOMO value of -6.925298 eV, which is significantly higher than CC1(C)OC1(C)C's εHOMO value of -6.862712 eV despite having similar functional groups.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a heteroatom such as nitrogen or oxygen, it tends to have a lower εHOMO value compared to hydrocarbons. For instance, O=C1NC=C[C@@H](CO)O1 has a εHOMO value of -6.326647 eV, while N#C[C@@]1(N)C=CCNC1 has a slightly higher εHOMO value of -6.342974 eV due to its additional triple bond.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of π-bonds, it tends to have a higher εHOMO value compared to non-conjugated systems. For example, CO[C@H

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen or nitrogen in a molecule tends to increase its εHOMO value. For example, the molecule C[C@H]1[C@@H](O)[C@@]12C[C@H]1C[C@H]12 has two oxygen atoms and has a higher εHOMO value of -6.299436 compared to other molecules without oxygen atoms like CC1(C)[C@@H]2C[C@H]1[C@@H]2O which has only one oxygen atom and has a lower εHOMO value of -6.835500.
2. Rule 2: The presence of multiple bonds between carbon atoms also increases the εHOMO value of a molecule. For instance, the molecule O=CO[C@]12C[C@H]1[C@H]1N[C@H]12 has a double bond between carbon and oxygen atoms and has a high εHOMO value of -6.223244 while the molecule CCC(=O)C[C@@H](O)C#N has a single bond between carbon and oxygen atoms and has a relatively low εHOMO value of -7.186527.
3. Rule 3: The position of functional groups in a molecule

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value of a molecule based on its structure:
1. The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen or nitrogen in a molecule tends to decrease the εHOMO value. For example, the first four molecules have relatively low εHOMO values ranging from -5.83 eV to -7.62 eV due to the presence of oxygen or nitrogen atoms. On the other hand, the last six molecules have higher εHOMO values between -5.22 eV and -7.53 eV because they do not contain any oxygen or nitrogen atoms.
2. The conjugation of π bonds in a molecule also affects the εHOMO value. Molecules with conjugated double bonds tend to have lower εHOMO values than those without them. For instance, the fifth molecule has two conjugated double bonds, which results in a significantly lower εHOMO value of -6.20 eV compared to the rest of the molecules. Similarly, the thirteenth molecule contains a conjugated system consisting of a triple bond and a double bond, resulting in a slightly lower εHOMO value of -6.53 eV.
3. The position of substituents in a molecule can also affect the εHOMO value. In general, electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyl groups (C=O) or cyano groups (C≡N) attached to carbon atoms adjacent to each other tend to increase the εHOMO value by stabilizing the LUMO energy level. For example, the second

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Molecules containing electronegative atoms such as oxygen or nitrogen tend to have lower εHOMO values compared to those without these atoms. For example, the first four molecules in the table contain either oxygen or nitrogen, and they all have relatively low εHOMO values ranging from -4.547 eV to -6.541 eV. On the other hand, the last six molecules do not contain any oxygen or nitrogen, and they have higher εHOMO values between -5.363 eV and -7.771 eV.
2. Conjugation of π-bonds also affects the εHOMO value. Molecules with conjugated π-bonds tend to have lower εHOMO values due to increased delocalization of electrons. For instance, the fifth molecule has two double bonds connected by a single bond, which creates a conjugated system. It has one of the lowest εHOMO values at -6.476 eV among all the molecules listed. Similarly, the thirteenth molecule contains a five-membered ring with alternating double bonds, which also leads to conjugation and a low εHOMO value of -6.117 eV.
3. The presence of heteroatoms such as carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in a molecule can affect its εHOMO value. Generally, molecules with more heteroatoms tend to have lower εHOMO values because they have more electron-rich regions where electrons can be easily removed.

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Molecules containing conjugated double bonds have higher εHOMO values than those without them. For example, the first molecule has two conjugated double bonds, which contribute to its high εHOMO value of -7.49 eV. On the other hand, the last four molecules do not contain any conjugated double bonds, resulting in lower εHOMO values ranging from -5.74 to -6.89 eV.
2. The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen or nitrogen can increase the εHOMO value of a molecule. This is because these atoms pull electron density away from the carbon backbone, making it easier for electrons to escape from the molecule's highest occupied molecular orbital. For instance, the second molecule contains both oxygen and nitrogen atoms, resulting in a relatively high εHOMO value of -6.06 eV compared to the rest of the dataset.
3. The orientation of functional groups within a molecule also affects its εHOMO value. For example, the fifth molecule has an oxygen atom attached to one end of the carbon chain, while the sixth molecule has the same oxygen atom at the center of the chain. The former has a slightly higher εHOMO value of -6.65 eV due to the increased polarity of the C-O bond.

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Molecules containing conjugated double bonds have lower εHOMO values compared to those without conjugation. For example, compare the εHOMO values of C[C@@H]1[C@H](C)[C@@H]1C#CCO (-6.394676 eV) and CC1(C)CO[C@H]2C[C@@H]1C2 (-6.345695 eV). In the former case, there is a π-bond between the two carbon atoms in the carbonyl group, which makes it more conjugated than the latter one where no such bond exists. Therefore, the εHOMO value of the first compound is lower due to increased conjugation.
2. The presence of electronegative atoms like oxygen or fluorine in a molecule increases its εHOMO value. This is because these atoms pull electron density away from the rest of the molecule, making it less stable and increasing its reactivity. Compare the εHOMO values of CN1CC[C@H]2O[C@H]2C1=O (-6.506242 eV) and O=C1[C@@H]2O[C@@H]2[C@@]12C[C@@H]2O (-6.606925 eV). In the second compound, there are

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, it tends to have a lower εHOMO value compared to other molecules without such conjugation. For example, the first four molecules in the table contain a conjugated system of double bonds and they have relatively low εHOMO values ranging from -6.13 eV to -6.72 eV. On the other hand, the last five molecules do not have any conjugated systems and they have higher εHOMO values ranging from -5.45 eV to -7.34 eV.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule has a heteroatom such as nitrogen or oxygen, it tends to have a lower εHOMO value than similar molecules without these atoms. This is because the lone pair of electrons on the heteroatom can interact with the π-system of the molecule, which reduces the energy required for electron transfer. For instance, the fifth molecule in the table has a protonated amine group and its εHOMO value is -5.45 eV, while the sixth molecule does not have this group but has a similar structure and its εHOMO value is -6.13 eV. Similarly, the eleventh molecule has an aldehyde group and its εHOMO value is -6.72 eV, whereas the twelfth molecule does not have this

================================

1. Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine in a molecule tends to decrease its εHOMO value due to increased electron density around the molecule's periphery. For example, the first four molecules have relatively low εHOMO values compared to other molecules in the list because they contain at least one oxygen atom.
2. Rule 2: The number and position of double bonds in a molecule can also affect its εHOMO value. Conjugation between multiple double bonds can increase the molecule's electron density, leading to a lower εHOMO value. This is evident from the fact that the fifth molecule has a significantly higher εHOMO value than the sixth molecule despite having similar functional groups.
3. Rule 3: The type of hybridization of carbon atoms present in a molecule can also influence its εHOMO value. sp2 hybridized carbons tend to have lower εHOMO values than sp3 hybridized ones since they have less s character and therefore more localized π orbitals. This is exemplified by comparing the seventh and eighth molecules which differ only in the hybridization state of the central carbon atom.

================================

Step 1: Analyze the given dataset and identify any patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their respective εHOMO values.
Step 2: Based on your analysis, formulate three rules that can be used to predict the εHOMO value of a new molecule based on its structure.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, it tends to have a lower εHOMO value compared to non-conjugated systems. For example, the εHOMO value of C[C@H]1[C@H]2[C@H](C#N)CC[N@H+]21 (-6.517127) is lower than CO[C@@]1(C)CC(=O)[C@H]1O (-6.264061) due to the presence of a conjugated system of double bonds in the former.
Rule 2: If a molecule has a heteroatom such as nitrogen or oxygen, it tends to have a higher εHOMO value compared to hydrocarbons. For instance, the εHOMO value of O=CO[C@@H]1C[C@@]1(O)C=O (-7.298094) is higher than CCC(=O)n1cncn1 (-7.733476) because of the presence of an oxygen atom in the former.
Rule 3: The εHOMO value of a molecule

================================

To come up with three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the εHOMO value, we can follow these steps:
Step 1: Identify common features among the molecules whose εHOMO values are given in the table.
Step 2: Assign a numerical value to each feature based on its presence or absence in each molecule. For example, if a particular feature is present in a molecule, assign a value of 1; otherwise, assign a value of 0.
Step 3: Create a correlation matrix between the assigned values for each feature and the corresponding εHOMO values. This will help identify which features have a significant impact on the εHOMO value.
Based on this approach, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the εHOMO value:
Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a molecule tends to increase the εHOMO value compared to molecules without it.
Rule 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a molecule tends to decrease the εHOMO value compared to molecules without it.
Rule 3: The position of the nitrogen atom in a molecule also affects the εHOMO value. If the nitrogen atom is attached to two carbon atoms, as in the case of N#CCONCCCO, the εHOMO value is higher than when the nitrogen atom is attached to only one carbon atom, as in Cc1[nH]nc(C=O)c1O.

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), its εHOMO value will generally be lower than -6 eV. This is because the C=O bond has a high electron density due to the presence of two lone pairs of electrons on oxygen, which makes it easier for the molecule to donate electrons. For example, in the first molecule listed, the εHOMO value is -7.442314 eV.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), its εHOMO value will generally be higher than -6 eV. This is because the NO2 group has a low electron density due to the presence of two strongly electronegative atoms, which makes it harder for the molecule to donate electrons. For example, in the ninth molecule listed, the εHOMO value is -5.444998 eV.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, its εHOMO value will generally be higher than -6 eV. This is because conjugation allows for more efficient delocalization of π-electrons, which makes it easier for the molecule to donate electrons. For example, in the thirteenth molecule listed, the εHOMO value is -6.547060 eV.

================================

Step 1: Analyze the given dataset and identify any patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their respective HOMO values.
Step 2: Based on your analysis, formulate three rules that can be used to predict the HOMO value of a new molecule based on its structure.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it tends to have a higher HOMO value compared to other molecules without this functional group. For example, the first two molecules in the dataset contain a nitro group and have a significantly higher HOMO value than the rest of the molecules.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it tends to have a lower HOMO value compared to other molecules without this functional group. For example, the third and fourth molecules in the dataset contain a carbonyl group and have a slightly lower HOMO value than the rest of the molecules.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a cyclic structure, it tends to have a lower HOMO value compared to other molecules without this structural feature. For example, the last four molecules in the dataset contain a cyclic structure and have a relatively low HOMO value compared to the others.

================================

Step 1: Analyze the given dataset and identify any patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their respective εHOMO values.
Step 2: Based on your analysis, formulate three rules that can be used to predict the εHOMO value of a new molecule based on its structure.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it tends to have a higher εHOMO value than other types of functional groups. For example, the first four molecules in the dataset contain C=O groups and have relatively high εHOMO values ranging from -5.670853 to -7.221901 eV.
Rule 2: If a molecule has a conjugated system of π bonds, it tends to have a lower εHOMO value compared to non-conjugated systems. For instance, the last two molecules in the dataset have conjugated systems and have low εHOMO values of -6.506242 and -6.364743 eV respectively.
Rule 3: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen and nitrogen in a molecule can also affect its εHOMO value. Generally, molecules containing these atoms tend to have lower εHOMO values due to the electron-withdrawing effect of these atoms. For example, the fifth molecule in the dataset contains both O and N atoms and has a relatively low εHOMO value of -5.654526 eV.

================================

Step 1: Analyze the given dataset and identify any patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their respective HOMO values.
Step 2: Based on your analysis, formulate three rules that can be used to predict the HOMO value of a new molecule based on its structure.
Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, and fluorine in a molecule tends to decrease the HOMO value. For example, the first four molecules in the dataset have relatively lower HOMO values compared to the rest of the molecules due to the presence of oxygen and nitrogen atoms.
Rule 2: The conjugation of double bonds in a molecule increases the HOMO value. For instance, the fifth molecule has two conjugated double bonds which contribute to its higher HOMO value.
Rule 3: The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule also affects the HOMO value. Aromatic compounds tend to have higher HOMO values than non-aromatic ones because of the delocalization of pi electrons throughout the ring. This is evident from the tenth molecule's high HOMO value despite having only one double bond.

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. The presence of oxygen atoms in a molecule tends to increase its εHOMO value. For example, the first four molecules have oxygen atoms and their εHOMO values range from -6.840942 to -6.321205 eV. On the other hand, the last six molecules do not contain any oxygen atom and their εHOMO values range from -5.823236 to -4.272188 eV.
2. The presence of double bonds or aromatic rings in a molecule also increases its εHOMO value. For instance, the fifth molecule has two double bonds and its εHOMO value is -5.951130 eV, which is higher than those of the sixth and seventh molecules, which only have one double bond each. Similarly, the ninth molecule contains an aromatic ring and its εHOMO value is -6.378349 eV, which is significantly higher than those of the remaining molecules.
3. The position of functional groups such as amines, alcohols, and carbonyls can affect the εHOMO value of a molecule. For example, the tenth molecule has an amine group attached to a carbon atom adjacent to another carbon atom, while the eleventh molecule has it attached to a terminal carbon atom. As a result, the former has a lower εHOMO value (-6.604203 eV) compared to the latter (-5.594661 eV

================================

Step 1: Analyze the given data and identify any patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their respective εHOMO values.
Step 2: Based on your analysis, formulate three rules that can be used to predict the εHOMO value of a molecule based on its structure.
Rule 1: A molecule containing a heteroatom such as nitrogen or oxygen has a higher εHOMO value than a hydrocarbon molecule. This is because the lone pair of electrons on the heteroatom increases the electron density around the molecule, resulting in a more stable HOMO.
Example: C1[C@H]2C[C@H]3[C@@H]1[N@@H+]23 (εHOMO = -6.555 eV) vs CC1=Cc2ncnn2C1 (εHOMO = -6.204 eV)
Rule 2: A molecule with a conjugated π-system has a lower εHOMO value compared to a non-conjugated system. Conjugation allows for delocalization of electrons, which results in a less stable HOMO.
Example: CO[C@H]1[C@H]2OCCO[C@@H]12 (εHOMO = -6.122 eV) vs O=C1CN[C@@H](CO)C1 (εHOMO = -6.223 eV)
Rule 3: A molecule with a rigid structure has a

================================

Step 1: Analyze the given data and identify any patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their respective εHOMO values.
Step 2: Based on your analysis, formulate three rules that can be used to predict the εHOMO value of a molecule based on its structure.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it tends to have a higher εHOMO value than other types of functional groups. For example, the εHOMO values of molecules containing C=O range from -5.670853 to -8.011032 eV, while those without C=O range from -6.130725 to -6.952509 eV.
Rule 2: If a molecule has a conjugated system, i.e., multiple double bonds or aromatic rings connected by single bonds, it tends to have a lower εHOMO value compared to non-conjugated systems. For instance, the εHOMO value of CC(C)/C(=N\O)[C@@H](C)O (-6.549781 eV) is lower than that of CCC1=C[C@H]2C[C@@H](C1)O2 (-6.182427 eV) due to conjugation between the C=O bond and the adjacent double bond.
Rule 3: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, and fluorine in

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εHOMO value based on the structure of a molecule:
1. Molecules containing conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings tend to have higher εHOMO values than those without such structures. For example, C#Cc1cc(N)c(N)o1 has two conjugated double bonds and has the highest εHOMO value among all the molecules listed in the table. Similarly, CC[C@H]1CO[C@H]2C[C@H]2O1 contains an aromatic ring and also has a high εHOMO value.
2. The presence of electronegative atoms like oxygen and nitrogen can increase the εHOMO value of a molecule. For instance, O[C@]12C[C@H]1[C@@H]1C[C@H]2CO1 has two oxygen atoms and has one of the highest εHOMO values among the molecules listed in the table. On the other hand, N#CSc1ccc(Cl)s1 has no oxygen atom and has one of the lowest εHOMO values.
3. The charge on a molecule can affect its εHOMO value. For example, NC(=O)C(=O)[C@H]1CN1 has a negative charge on it due to the presence of the -CN group, which results in a relatively low εHOMO value compared to neutral molecules like CCC[C@H]1COC1.

================================

Step 1: Analyze the given data and identify any patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their respective εHOMO values.
Step 2: Based on your analysis, formulate three rules that can be used to predict the εHOMO value of a molecule based on its structure.
Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, and fluorine in a molecule tends to increase its εHOMO value. This is because these atoms have a higher electron affinity than carbon, which causes the electrons in the π orbitals to become more stable and less reactive.
Example: The molecule COC(C1CC1)C1CC1 has two carbonyl groups (C=O), which contribute to its high εHOMO value of -6.702164 eV.
Rule 2: The presence of multiple double bonds between carbon atoms in a molecule also increases its εHOMO value. This is because each double bond contributes two π electrons, which makes the molecule more stable and less reactive.
Example: The molecule C[C@H]1C[C@@]12C[C@H]1OC[C@H]12 has two double bonds between carbon atoms, which contributes to its relatively high εHOMO value of -6.481752 eV.
Rule 3: The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule decreases its εHOMO value. This is because the π electrons in the ring are delocalized over several atoms, making them less available for bonding interactions.
Example: The molecule O=C1CNCCC1

================================
