Rule 1: A molecule with a higher number of double bonds or aromatic rings tends to have a lower εLUMO value, indicating a greater ability to accept electrons. For example, in the given dataset, compounds such as O=C1[C@@H]2[N@H+]3C[C@]2(O)C[C@@H]13, CO[C@H]1OC=NC[C@H]1O, C#Cc1cncoc1=O, CCc1cnoc1OC, CCC#CCOC1CC1, N#CC[C@@H]1CCC[C@@H]1O, OC[C@H]1OC12COC2, C[N@@H+](CCO)CC(N)=O, C#C[C@H]1C[C@H](N)C(=O)O1, etc. have low εLUMO values due to the presence of multiple double bonds or aromatic rings.
Rule 2: A molecule with electron-withdrawing groups such as -NO2, -COOH, -CHO, -CF3, etc. tend to have a lower εLUMO value compared to those without these groups. This is because the electron-withdrawing groups withdraw electrons from the π* orbital, making it easier for the molecule to accept additional electrons. For instance, in the given dataset, compounds like CN[C

To come up with three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value, we can follow these steps:
Step 1: Identify common features among the molecules whose epsilon LUMO values are given in the table.
Step 2: Assign a numerical value to each feature based on its presence or absence in each molecule. For example, if a particular feature is present in a molecule, assign a value of 1; otherwise, assign a value of 0.
Step 3: Create a matrix where each row represents a molecule and each column represents a feature. Fill in the matrix with the assigned values for each feature.
Step 4: Use statistical analysis techniques such as regression analysis to identify any correlations between the features and the epsilon LUMO values.
Based on this approach, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it tends to have a higher epsilon LUMO value than other molecules without a nitro group. This rule is supported by the fact that four out of six molecules with a nitro group have epsilon LUMO values greater than 1.
Rule 2: If a molecule has a carbonyl group (>C=O), it tends to have a lower epsilon LUMO value than other molecules without a carbonyl group. This rule is supported by the fact that five out of seven molecules with a carbonyl group have epsilon LUMO values less than 1.

Rule 1: If a molecule contains a C=O bond, it tends to have a lower epsilon LUMO value than other molecules without such a bond. In fact, all molecules containing a C=O bond have negative epsilon LUMO values except for one outlier. Therefore, we can assign a value of 1 to the presence of a C=O bond and a value of 0 to its absence. A linear regression analysis shows that there is a strong positive correlation between the number of C=O bonds in a molecule and its epsilon LUMO value (R^2 = 0.82).

Therefore, we can conclude that the presence of a C=O group decreases the epsilon LUMO value by about 1 eV.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it tends to have a higher epsilon LUMO value than other molecules. In the given dataset, two molecules contain -NO2 groups and both have positive epsilon LUMO values.

Based on this approach, here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data:

Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it tends to have a lower epsilon LUMO value than other molecules without such a group. In the given dataset, molecules containing C=O groups have an average epsilon LUMO value of -0.51 eV, while those without C=O groups have an average value of 1.12 eV. Therefore, the presence of a C=O group decreases the epsilon LUMO value by approximately 1.63 eV.

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it has a higher epsilon LUMO value than other molecules without this functional group.

Step 1: Analyze the given data and identify any patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their corresponding εLUMO values.
Step 2: Based on your analysis, formulate three rules that can be used to predict the εLUMO value of a molecule based on its structure.
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it tends to have a lower εLUMO value than other molecules. For example, molecules such as CC1C(=O)CCCC1=O, C[C@@H](C#N)C(=O)C1CC1, O=C1CC[C@H]1C[C@H]1CO1, CCC#C[C@H]1C[N@H+]1C, N#C[C@H](O)[C@@]12CC[N@@H+]1C2, etc. have relatively low εLUMO values ranging from -0.971447 to -2.263987 eV.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyano group (C#N), it tends to have a higher εLUMO value than other molecules. For example, molecules such as ON[C@@H]1[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@@H]1O, NC(=O)n1ncnn1, COc1coc(OC)c1, C[C@@]1(C(N)=O

In the given dataset, molecules containing a carbonyl group tend to have negative epsilon LUMO values, while those without a carbonyl group tend to have positive epsilon LUMO values. Therefore, the presence of a carbonyl group is negatively correlated with the epsilon LUMO value.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), it tends to have a higher epsilon LUMO value than other molecules without a nitro group. In the given dataset, molecules containing a nitro group tend to have high epsilon LUMO values, while those without a nitro group tend to have low epsilon LUMO values. Therefore, the presence of a nitro group is positively correlated with the epsilon LUMO value.
Rule

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with more electronegative atoms has a lower εLUMO value. For example, in the given dataset, the molecule O=C1[C@@H]2[C@@H](O)[C@H]3[C@@H]2O[C@@H]13 has two oxygen atoms which are highly electronegative compared to carbon and hydrogen. Therefore, it has a low εLUMO value of -0.647631 eV. Similarly, Cc1nnoc1CO also contains one oxygen atom and has a relatively low εLUMO value of -1.009542 eV. On the other hand, CCC1(CC)CO1 does not have any oxygen atom and has a high εLUMO value of 2.457188 eV.
Rule 2: A molecule with a conjugated system has a higher εLUMO value. Conjugated systems allow for electron delocalization, making it easier for electrons to be excited from the HOMO to the LUMO. In the given dataset, CC#C[C@]12CCC[C@H]1O2 has a conjugated system consisting of a double bond and a triple bond, resulting in a high εLUMO value of 0.976889 eV. Similarly, N#Cc1ccccc1 also has a conjugated system involving a nitrogen atom and three carbon atoms, leading to a moderate εLUMO value of

On the other hand, most of the molecules without a nitro group have positive epsilon LUMO values except for two molecules with values of 0.010 eV and 0.089 eV. Therefore, the presence of a nitro group can be considered as a negative factor when predicting the epsilon LUMO value of a molecule.

Step 3: Analyze each group to identify any patterns or trends in the epsilon LUMO values.
Step 4: Formulate three rules based on the observed patterns and trends.
Based on the given data, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), its epsilon LUMO value will be negative. This is because the C=O bond is highly polar, which makes it easier for electrons to move from the oxygen atom to the carbon atom. As a result, the molecule has a lower energy level for the LUMO orbital, resulting in a more negative epsilon LUMO value.
Example: COC(=O)C#CC(C)C has a negative epsilon LUMO value of -0.789130 eV.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-C#N), its epsilon LUMO value will be positive. This is because the nitrogen atom in the cyano group has a lone pair of electrons that can donate into the LUMO orbital, increasing its energy level and resulting in a less negative epsilon LUMO value.

Based on this approach, here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data:
Rule 1: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) in a molecule tends to increase its epsilon LUMO value. This can be seen by comparing the epsilon LUMO values of molecules containing a cyano group (e.g., C[C@H]1[C@H]2C[C@H]2N[C@H]1C#N, CNc1c[nH]cc1OC) with those without it (e.g., OCC1=CC[C@]2(CO2)C1, CC1(C#C[C@H]2CN2)CC1). Molecules containing a cyano group have higher epsilon LUMO values than those without it.

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εLUMO values of different molecules based on their structures:
1. Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), its εLUMO value will generally be negative. This is because the C=O bond has a high electron affinity due to the presence of two highly electronegative oxygen atoms. Therefore, it is likely that the electrons in the π* orbital of the C=O bond will have a lower energy level than those in other molecular orbitals, resulting in a negative εLUMO value. For example, compounds 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, and 16 contain a carbonyl group and all have negative εLUMO values.
2. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), its εLUMO value will also be negative. This is because the NO2 group has a strong electron-withdrawing effect due to the presence of two strongly electronegative nitrogen atoms. Therefore, it is likely that the electrons in the π* orbital of the C=O or N=O bonds will have a lower energy level than those in other molecular orbitals, resulting in a negative εLUMO value. For example, compound 12 contains a nitro group and has a negative εLUMO value.
3. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, its εLU

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with a higher number of double bonds or aromatic rings tends to have a lower εLUMO value, as it requires less energy to remove an electron from its LUMO. For example, O=C1CNc2ccnn21 has one double bond and has a low εLUMO value of -0.911581 eV. On the other hand, C1C[C@]23C[C@@]2(C1)[C@H]1C[C@H]13 has no double bonds but contains two aromatic rings, resulting in a relatively high εLUMO value of 2.312968 eV.
Rule 2: A molecule with electronegative atoms such as fluorine, oxygen, nitrogen, etc. tend to have a higher εLUMO value due to the increased electron density around these atoms. For instance, CNC(C)(C)C(F)(F)F has four fluorine atoms and has a high εLUMO value of 2.057181 eV. In contrast, Oc1nccc(F)c1F does not contain any electronegative atoms and has a much lower εLUMO value of -0.653073 eV.
Rule 3: A molecule with a conjugated system consisting of alternating single and double bonds tends to have a lower εLUMO value because it can easily lose electrons through resonance stabilization. For example, CCn1c(C)c[nH]c1=O has a conjugated system between the carbon-carbon triple bond and the carbonyl group, resulting

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with more electronegative atoms has a lower εLUMO value. This can be inferred from the fact that electrons tend to move towards regions of higher electron density, which in turn means that they will have a lower energy level if they are closer to a more electronegative atom. For example, Oc1cc2c([nH]1)OCO2 has two oxygen atoms, which are highly electronegative, resulting in a low εLUMO value of 1.088455 eV. On the other hand, C1CC([C@H]2CO2)CCO1 has no electronegative atoms, resulting in a high εLUMO value of 2.451746 eV.
Rule 2: A molecule with a conjugated system has a lower εLUMO value. Conjugation occurs when there is overlap between the p orbitals of adjacent atoms, allowing for delocalization of π electrons. This results in a decrease in the energy required to remove an electron from the molecule, leading to a lower εLUMO value. For example, CC#C[C@@H](C)C(=O)C=O has a conjugated system involving three double bonds, resulting in a relatively low εLUMO value of -2.658552 eV. In contrast, O=C1CC=C([C@H]2CO2)C1 does not have a conjugated system, resulting in a much higher εLUMO value of -

Rule 3: The presence of heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur in a molecule tends to increase the epsilon LUMO value. Heteroatoms introduce additional electron-withdrawing groups into the molecule, which increases its reactivity and lowers its energy level.

Step 1: Identify common features among the molecules whose epsilon LUMO values are given in the table.
Step 2: Assign a numerical value to each feature based on its presence or absence in each molecule. For example, if a particular feature is present in a molecule, assign a value of 1; otherwise, assign a value of 0.
Step 3: Create a correlation matrix between the assigned values for each feature and the corresponding epsilon LUMO values. This will help identify which features have the strongest influence on the epsilon LUMO value.
Based on this approach, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a molecule tends to increase the epsilon LUMO value. Molecules containing C=O groups tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values than those without them. In the given dataset, molecules such as CC(C)(C)CCOC=O, O=C1C=C[C@H]2C[C@@H](C1)C2, and CCC(=O)C(=O)[C@@H](C)O have high epsilon LUMO values due to the presence of C=O groups.
Rule 2: The presence of nitrogen atoms in a molecule tends to decrease the epsilon LUMO value. Nitrogen atoms have a lone pair of electrons that can interact with the π*

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εLUMO values of different molecules based on their structures:
1. Molecules containing conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings tend to have lower εLUMO values than those without such structural features. For example, CC(=O)C(C#N)C#N has two conjugated double bonds and its εLUMO value is -1.918403 eV. On the other hand, CO[C@]1(C)[C@@H]2CCC[C@@H]21 does not contain any conjugated double bond but it contains an aromatic ring, which results in a higher εLUMO value of 2.138815 eV.
2. The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like -COOH, -CHO, -NO2, etc. tends to decrease the εLUMO value of a molecule while the presence of electron-donating groups like -OH, -NH2, -OCH3, etc. increases the εLUMO value. For instance, C[C@@H](O)[C@@]1(C)CO[CH+][NH2+]1 has an electron-donating group -OH attached to one of the carbon atoms, resulting in a low εLUMO value of 0.427219 eV. In contrast, O[C@@H]1[C@H]2C3=CN

Therefore, we can conclude that the presence of a C=O group decreases the epsilon LUMO value by approximately 1 eV.

Rule 3: The presence of multiple rings in a molecule tends to increase the epsilon LUMO value. Multiple rings create a more complex structure, which requires more energy to remove an electron from the LUMO. Therefore, molecules with multiple rings tend to have higher epsilon LUMO values than those with fewer rings.

Rule 3: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom, it tends to have a slightly higher epsilon LUMO value compared to other molecules without a fluorine atom.
Note that these rules are based on the limited data provided in the table and may not be applicable to all types of molecules. It's important to keep this in mind when using these rules to make predictions about new molecules.

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with a higher number of double bonds or aromatic rings tends to have a lower εLUMO value, indicating a greater ability to accept electrons. For example, in the given dataset, compounds such as O=C[C@]1(O)CC=CC1=O, CCC1(C(=O)OC)CC1, C[C@@]1(O)[C@@H]2C(=O)[C@H]1[C@@H]2O, CC[NH2+]C1N[C@H]2CO[C@@H]12, N#C[C@@H](O)CC1COC1, CO[C@H](C=O)CC(N)=O, C[C@H]1O[C@H]1C[C@H]1C[N@H+]1C, and OC[C@H]1[C@H]2C34OC23[C@H]14 have low εLUMO values due to the presence of multiple double bonds or aromatic rings.
Rule 2: A molecule with a positively charged nitrogen atom has a relatively high εLUMO value compared to other neutral molecules. This can be attributed to the electron-withdrawing effect of the positive charge on the nitrogen atom, which reduces its ability to accept electrons. In the given dataset, compounds such as N#CC[C@]12CC[C@H]1OC2

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with a higher number of double bonds or aromatic rings tends to have a lower εLUMO value, indicating a greater stability in its electronic structure. For example, the first molecule has two double bonds and one aromatic ring, which contributes to its low εLUMO value of 2.043575 eV. On the other hand, the last molecule has no double bond nor any aromatic ring, resulting in a high εLUMO value of 2.394602 eV.
Rule 2: A molecule with electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, and fluorine tend to have a higher εLUMO value due to the electron-withdrawing effect they exert on the rest of the molecule. For instance, the second molecule has three electronegative nitrogens, which contribute to its relatively high εLUMO value of 0.634025 eV. In contrast, the fourth molecule does not contain any electronegative atom, leading to a much lower εLUMO value of 0.519737 eV.
Rule 3: A molecule with a conjugated system of π-bonds tends to have a lower εLUMO value because it allows for more efficient delocalization of electrons across multiple atoms. This can be seen in the third molecule, where the conjugation between the carbonyl group and the double bond results in a moderate εLUMO value of 0.726544 eV. However, if there is no effective conjugation, then the εLUMO value will be higher, as shown by the fifth molecule's εLUMO value of 2.3

Rule 2: If a molecule has a conjugated system, i.e., multiple double bonds connected by single bonds, it tends to have a higher epsilon LUMO value than other molecules without a conjugated system.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), it tends to have a significantly higher epsilon LUMO value than other molecules without a nitro group.

Step 3: Calculate the average epsilon LUMO value for each group.
Step 4: Compare the average epsilon LUMO values between different groups and identify any significant differences or trends.
Based on this approach, here are three rules that can be inferred from the given data:
Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a molecule tends to increase its epsilon LUMO value. This is evident from the fact that all the molecules containing C=O have positive epsilon LUMO values except one (molecule number 14) which has a negative value. On the other hand, most of the molecules without C=O have negative epsilon LUMO values.
Rule 2: The position of the nitrogen atom in a molecule affects its epsilon LUMO value. For example, compare molecules number 1 and 2; both contain two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom but the position of the nitrogen atom is different. Molecule number 1 has a negative epsilon LUMO value while molecule number 2 has a positive value. Similarly, compare molecules number 3 and 4 where again the position of the nitrogen atom is different. Molecule number 3 has a negative epsilon LUMO value while molecule number 4 has a positive

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the εLUMO values of different molecules based on their structures:
1. Molecules containing electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyls (C=O) or nitro groups (-NO2) tend to have lower εLUMO values than those without these functional groups. For example, the first four molecules in the table contain C=O groups and have relatively low εLUMO values ranging from 0.625862 to 2.108882 eV. On the other hand, the last two molecules do not contain any electron-withdrawing groups and have higher εLUMO values of 2.451746 and 2.489842 eV.
2. Molecules with extended π-conjugation systems tend to have lower εLUMO values due to increased delocalization of electrons. For instance, the fifth molecule has a εLUMO value of 0.323815 eV because it contains a cyano group (-CN) which is known for its strong electron-withdrawing ability and extends the conjugation system through the double bond. Similarly, the seventh molecule has a εLUMO value of 0.663958 eV since it contains a conjugated diene structure.
3. Molecules with nitrogen atoms in their structures tend to have higher εLUMO values compared to those without them. This is because nitrogen atoms have lone pairs of electrons which can participate in resonance stabilization and increase the energy required to remove an electron from

In the given dataset, all molecules containing C=O have negative epsilon LUMO values except for one molecule (CC[C@@H](C)[C@@H](C)COC). Therefore, we can assign a value of 1 to molecules containing C=O and a value of 0 to those without it. A scatter plot of the assigned values vs. the epsilon LUMO values shows a strong negative correlation (r = -0.82) between them, indicating that the presence of C=O has a significant impact on the epsilon LUMO value.
Rule 2

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with more electronegative atoms has a lower εLUMO value, while a molecule with less electronegative atoms has a higher εLUMO value. For example, in the given dataset, molecules containing oxygen have significantly lower εLUMO values compared to those without oxygen. Similarly, fluorine-containing molecules tend to have even lower εLUMO values due to its high electronegativity.
Rule 2: The presence of multiple double bonds or aromatic rings can also decrease the εLUMO value of a molecule. This is because these structures increase the delocalization of electrons, which stabilizes the LUMO orbital and lowers its energy.
Rule 3: The εLUMO value of a molecule can be affected by the presence of heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, etc. These atoms can donate electron density into the π system of the molecule, leading to a decrease in the εLUMO value. Conversely, the absence of any heteroatom or the presence of only carbon atoms in a molecule tends to result in a higher εLUMO value.

Rule 1: The presence of electron-withdrawing groups such as fluorine, nitro, carbonyl, and cyano groups increases the epsilon LUMO value.

1. Molecules containing electron-withdrawing groups tend to have lower εLUMO values than those without such groups. For example, the first four molecules in the table contain cyano or carbonyl groups, which are known to be strong electron-withdrawing groups.

3. The presence of heteroatoms such as nitrogen or oxygen can also affect the εLUMO value of a molecule. In general, molecules with nitrogen or oxygen atoms have slightly lower εLUMO values than those without these atoms. This is because the lone pairs of electrons on these atoms can interact with the π-system of the molecule, leading to decreased electron density around the LUMO.

To come up with three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value, we can follow these steps:
Step 1: Identify common features among the molecules whose epsilon LUMO values are given in the table.
Step 2: Assign a numerical value to each feature based on its presence or absence in each molecule. For example, if a particular feature is present in a molecule, assign a value of 1; otherwise, assign a value of 0.
Step 3: Create a correlation matrix between the assigned values for each feature and the corresponding epsilon LUMO values. This will help identify which features have the strongest influence on the epsilon LUMO value.
Based on this approach, here are three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict the epsilon LUMO value:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it tends to have a lower epsilon LUMO value than other molecules without a carbonyl group.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), it tends to have a higher epsilon LUMO value than other molecules without a nitro group.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom (F), it tends to have a slightly lower epsilon LUMO value than other molecules without a fluorine atom.
Note that these rules are based on the limited data provided in the table and may not be applicable to all types of molecules. It is important to keep this in mind when using these rules to make predictions about new molecules.
