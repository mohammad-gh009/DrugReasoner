Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine in a molecule can increase its HOMO-LUMO gap value due to the electron-withdrawing effect they have on the molecule's electronic structure. For example, the first four molecules listed have relatively high HOMO-LUMO gaps compared to other molecules in the list because they contain one or more electronegative atoms.
Rule 2: The number and position of double bonds in a molecule can also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap value. Conjugation between multiple double bonds can lower the energy of the LUMO level, resulting in a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap. This is evident from comparing the fifth and sixth molecules in the list which both contain a conjugated system but have different HOMO-LUMO gap values.
Rule 3: The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule can also impact its HOMO-LUMO gap value. Aromatic systems have a higher degree of conjugation than non-aromatic ones, leading to a decrease in the HOMO-LUMO gap. This is seen by comparing the third and seventh molecules in the list where the former contains an aromatic ring while the latter does not.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electron withdrawing groups such as carbonyl, nitro, and cyano groups tend to decrease the HOMO-LUMO gap values while the presence of electron donating groups such as alkyl and alkoxy groups tend to increase them. This is because electron withdrawing groups attract electrons from the molecule making it easier for them to be excited or moved to higher energy levels resulting in lower HOMO-LUMO gaps. On the other hand, electron donating groups repel electrons making it harder for them to be excited or moved to higher energy levels resulting in higher HOMO-LUMO gaps.
Example: Molecule 1 has two carbonyl groups which are electron withdrawing groups causing its HOMO-LUMO gap value to be low at 7.445 eV. In contrast, Molecule 10 has no functional groups and its HOMO-LUMO gap value is high at 8.824 eV due to the absence of any strong electron attracting or donating groups.
Rule 2: The number and position of double bonds also affect the HOMO-LUMO gap value. Generally, increasing the number of double bonds decreases the HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because each double bond creates a new molecular orbital which can hold two electrons. When there are more double bonds present, there are more available orbitals for electrons to occupy leading to a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap. Additionally, the position of the double bonds can also impact the HOMO-LUMO gap value. For example, Molecule 12 has one double bond between carbon atoms 1 and 2 but its HOMO-LUMO gap value is relatively high at 8.39

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine in a molecule tends to decrease its HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because these atoms have a higher electron affinity than carbon, which causes a shift in the molecular orbitals towards lower energies. For example, the first three molecules listed have relatively low HOMO-LUMO gaps due to the presence of oxygen and nitrogen atoms.
Rule 2: The number and position of double bonds in a molecule also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap value. Generally, increasing the number of double bonds leads to a decrease in the HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because the π-orbitals involved in double bonds have lower energy levels compared to single bonds, leading to a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap. Additionally, the position of the double bond can also influence the electronic structure of the molecule and hence its HOMO-LUMO gap value. For instance, the fourth molecule has two double bonds but a high HOMO-LUMO gap value, likely due to the fact that they are separated by a single bond.
Rule 3: The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule can increase its HOMO-LUMO gap value. Aromatic rings have a stable electronic configuration due to the delocalization of electrons over multiple atoms, resulting in higher energy levels for both the HOMO and LUMO. Therefore, molecules containing aromatic rings tend to have larger HOMO-LUMO gap values. For example, the last four molecules listed all contain aromatic rings and have relatively high HOMO-LUMO gap values.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen or fluorine in a molecule can significantly reduce its HOMO-LUMO gap value due to their electronegativity difference from carbon atoms. For example, the first four molecules have relatively low HOMO-LUMO gaps compared to other molecules in the dataset.
Rule 2: Conjugation effects can also affect the HOMO-LUMO gap values of molecules. When there is a continuous chain of π-bonds between two or more double bonds, it creates a delocalization of electrons which lowers the energy required for electron excitation. This effect is observed in the fifth and sixth molecules where the conjugation of the carbonyl group with the adjacent double bond reduces the HOMO-LUMO gap value.
Rule 3: The geometry of a molecule plays a role in determining its electronic structure and thus its HOMO-LUMO gap value. Planar molecules tend to have lower HOMO-LUMO gap values than non-planar ones because they allow for greater orbital overlap and electron delocalization. For instance, the last three molecules have relatively high HOMO-LUMO gap values despite having conjugated systems since they are not planar.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen or fluorine in a molecule can increase its HOMO-LUMO gap value due to the difference in electronegativity between these atoms and carbon. This results in a decrease in the electron density around the central atom which makes it less reactive towards other molecules.
Example: Molecule 1 has two nitrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, resulting in a higher HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to Molecule 2 which only contains carbon and hydrogen atoms.
Rule 2: The presence of multiple bonds between carbon atoms in a molecule can also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap value. In general, the more double bonds there are, the lower the HOMO-LUMO gap value will be.
Example: Molecule 3 has three double bonds between carbon atoms, resulting in a low HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to Molecules 4 and 5 which have fewer double bonds.
Rule 3: The shape and size of a molecule can also influence its HOMO-LUMO gap value. For example, linear molecules tend to have smaller HOMO-LUMO gap values than non-linear ones because they have weaker π-bonding interactions.
Example: Molecule 6 is linear while Molecule 7 is non-linear, resulting in a lower HOMO-LUMO gap value for Molecule 6.

================================

Step 1: Analyze the given dataset and identify any patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their respective HOMO-LUMO gaps.
Step 2: Identify three distinct structural features that appear frequently in the molecules with smaller HOMO-LUMO gaps, i.e., those that have higher reactivity. These could be functional groups such as carbonyls, nitro groups, or cyano groups.
Rule 1: Molecules containing conjugated double bonds tend to have lower HOMO-LUMO gaps than those without conjugation. This is because the pi electrons in the conjugated system can move freely across multiple atoms, leading to a decrease in energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). For example, the molecule C[C@H]1C[C@]1(O)C(=O)C=O has two conjugated double bonds and has a small HOMO-LUMO gap of 3.989189 eV. On the other hand, the molecule CO[C@H]1C[C@@H]2C[C@H]1[C@H]2O does not contain any conjugated double bonds and has a larger HOMO-LUMO gap of 8.748461 eV.
Rule 2: Molecules with electron-withdrawing groups tend to have lower HOMO-LUMO gaps than those with electron-donating groups. This is because electron-withdrawing groups withdraw electrons from the rest of the molecule, making it more reactive towards nucleophilic attack. For example, the molecule N#Cc1ccnc(O)c1 contains a

================================

Rule 1: The presence of heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur in a molecule can significantly reduce its HOMO-LUMO gap value due to the difference in electronegativity between these atoms and carbon. For example, the first three molecules have relatively low HOMO-LUMO gaps compared to other molecules in the list because they contain oxygen or nitrogen atoms.
Rule 2: Conjugation can also affect the HOMO-LUMO gap value by extending the π-electron system across multiple double bonds. In general, conjugated systems tend to have lower HOMO-LUMO gap values than non-conjugated ones. For instance, the fourth molecule has a higher HOMO-LUMO gap value than the fifth one despite having similar functional groups since it lacks conjugation.
Rule 3: The geometry of a molecule can also play a role in determining its HOMO-LUMO gap value. For example, the last two molecules have different geometries but similar structures except for the position of the carbonyl group. The sixth molecule has a much smaller HOMO-LUMO gap value than the seventh one likely due to the planarity of the former which allows for more efficient conjugation.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyl, cyano, or nitro groups decreases the HOMO-LUMO gap value. For example, in the first molecule, the two carbonyl groups present in the structure decrease the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), resulting in a lower HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to other molecules without these functional groups.
Rule 2: The presence of electron-donating groups such as alkyl or aryl groups increases the HOMO-LUMO gap value. In the third molecule, the presence of the alkyl group on the carbon atom adjacent to the oxygen atom increases the energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO, leading to a higher HOMO-LUMO gap value than other molecules without this functional group.
Rule 3: The conjugation of pi bonds affects the HOMO-LUMO gap value. When there is extended conjugation throughout the molecule, it leads to a lower HOMO-LUMO gap value due to increased delocalization of electrons. This can be seen in the eighth molecule where the double bond between the two carbon atoms allows for greater conjugation of pi bonds, resulting in a lower HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to other molecules without this structural feature.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine in a molecule can increase its HOMO-LUMO gap value due to the electron-withdrawing effect they have on the molecule's electrons. This makes it harder for the molecule to gain or lose electrons, resulting in a higher energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). For example, the first molecule has two electronegative oxygen atoms which contribute to its high HOMO-LUMO gap value of 7.0586 eV. On the other hand, the fourth molecule has no electronegative atoms and has a much lower HOMO-LUMO gap value of 5.8504 eV.
Rule 2: The conjugation of double bonds in a molecule can also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap value. When there is extended pi-conjugation throughout the molecule, the energy required to excite an electron from the HOMO to LUMO decreases, leading to a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap value. For instance, the sixth molecule has a conjugated system of three double bonds which results in a low HOMO-LUMO gap value of 5.9919 eV. In contrast, the tenth molecule does not have any conjugated systems and has a relatively high HOMO-LUMO gap value of 8.5851 eV.
Rule 3: The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule can also decrease its HOMO-LUMO gap value because of the stabilization of the molecule's electronic structure by resonance.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electron-withdrawing groups such as -NO2, -COOH, etc. decreases the HOMO-LUMO gap value while the presence of electron-donating groups like -OH, -NH2 increases it. This is because electron-withdrawing groups attract electrons from the molecule making it more stable and decreasing its reactivity, whereas electron-donating groups donate electrons to the molecule increasing its reactivity and destabilizing it.
Rule 2: The number of double bonds or aromatic rings in a molecule also affects the HOMO-LUMO gap value. Molecules with multiple double bonds or conjugated systems have lower HOMO-LUMO gaps than those with single bonds due to increased delocalization of π-electrons. Similarly, planar aromatic compounds have lower HOMO-LUMO gaps compared to non-planar ones due to greater conjugation.
Rule 3: The type of atoms present in a molecule can also affect the HOMO-LUMO gap value. For example, carbon-carbon double bonds have lower LUMO energies than carbon-oxygen double bonds, resulting in smaller HOMO-LUMO gap values for molecules containing oxygen.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine in a molecule tends to decrease its HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because these atoms have a higher electron affinity than carbon, which causes the LUMO energy level to shift downwards, resulting in a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap. For example, compare the HOMO-LUMO gaps of molecules 1 and 2, where molecule 1 has no electronegative atom while molecule 2 contains two oxygen atoms. Molecule 2 has a lower HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to molecule 1 due to the presence of the electronegative oxygen atoms.
Rule 2: The presence of multiple conjugated double bonds in a molecule also tends to decrease its HOMO-LUMO gap value. Conjugated double bonds allow for delocalization of electrons across several atoms, which lowers the LUMO energy level and results in a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap. For example, compare the HOMO-LUMO gaps of molecules 3 and 4, where both molecules contain a benzene ring but molecule 4 has additional conjugated double bonds. Molecule 4 has a lower HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to molecule 3 due to the increased conjugation.
Rule 3: The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule tends to increase its HOMO-LUMO gap value. Aromatic rings have a stable electronic configuration that requires a larger amount of energy to excite electrons from the HOMO to the LUMO. Therefore, molecules containing aromatic rings tend to have larger HOMO-LUMO gap values compared to non-aromatic compounds. For example, compare the HOMO-LUMO gaps of molecules 5 and

================================

Step 1: Analyze the given dataset and identify any patterns or trends in terms of molecular structures and their respective HOMO-LUMO gaps.
Step 2: Identify three distinct structural features that appear frequently among the molecules, such as functional groups, ring systems, and heteroatoms.
Step 3: Based on these identified features, formulate three rules that can be used to predict the HOMO-LUMO gap values for new molecules based on their structure. Here are the three rules:
Rule 1: Molecules containing conjugated double bonds have lower HOMO-LUMO gap values compared to those without conjugation. For example, the molecule C[C@@]1(CC#N)COC1=O has a HOMO-LUMO gap of 7.54 eV due to its extended π-system, while CCC(=O)C[NH+]1CCC1 has a higher HOMO-LUMO gap of 5.82 eV because it lacks a conjugated system.
Rule 2: Heteroatoms such as nitrogen and oxygen can significantly affect the electronic structure of a molecule and thus alter its HOMO-LUMO gap. For instance, O=CC[C@]12C[C@H]1OC2=O has a low HOMO-LUMO gap of 6.11 eV due to the presence of two electronegative oxygen atoms, whereas N#C[C@@H]1[C@@H]2C[C@H]1C2=O has a much higher HOMO-LUMO gap of 6.86 eV due to the absence of oxygen.
Rule 3: Aromatic rings can also influence the

================================

Step 1: Analyze the given dataset and identify any patterns or trends in terms of molecular structures and their respective HOMO-LUMO gaps.
Step 2: Identify three distinct structural features that appear frequently in the dataset, such as functional groups, ring systems, and heteroatoms.
Step 3: Based on these identified features, formulate three rules that can be used to predict the HOMO-LUMO gap values for new molecules based on their structure. Here are the three rules:
Rule 1: Molecules containing conjugated double bonds have lower HOMO-LUMO gap values compared to those without conjugation. For example, compare the HOMO-LUMO gap values of COCC/N=C(\N)C=O (4.843627 eV) and C#CC1=CCCC(=O)C1 (5.662690 eV).
Rule 2: Heteroatoms such as nitrogen and oxygen increase the HOMO-LUMO gap values due to their electronegativity. Compare the HOMO-LUMO gap values of O[C@H]1C[C@@H]2[C@@H]3C=C[C@@]21C3 (6.152494 eV) and CC1=C[C@@H]2C=C[C@H](C1)O2 (6.190590 eV).
Rule 3: The presence of electron-withdrawing

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine in a molecule tends to decrease its HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because these atoms have a higher electron affinity than carbon, which causes a shift in the molecular orbitals towards lower energies. For example, the first four molecules listed in the table contain at least one oxygen atom and have relatively low HOMO-LUMO gap values compared to the rest of the molecules.
Rule 2: The number and position of double bonds in a molecule can also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap value. Conjugation between multiple double bonds can cause a shift in the molecular orbitals towards lower energies, resulting in a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap value. For instance, the last two molecules listed in the table have conjugated double bonds and have significantly lower HOMO-LUMO gap values than other molecules without conjugation.
Rule 3: The type of hybridization of the atoms in a molecule can also influence its HOMO-LUMO gap value. sp2 hybridized atoms tend to have larger HOMO-LUMO gaps than sp3 hybridized atoms due to the greater overlap between the p-orbitals in the former case. For example, the second molecule listed in the table has an sp2 hybridized carbon atom and has a slightly larger HOMO-LUMO gap value than the third molecule, which contains only sp3 hybridized carbon atoms.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen or fluorine in a molecule can significantly reduce its HOMO-LUMO gap value due to their electronegativity difference from carbon atoms. For example, Molecule 1 has a high HOMO-LUMO gap value of 8.85 eV because it does not have any heteroatom. On the other hand, Molecule 2 has a low HOMO-LUMO gap value of 7.48 eV due to the presence of a cyano group (-CN) which contains a highly electronegative nitrogen atom. Similarly, Molecules 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 all contain at least one heteroatom and have lower HOMO-LUMO gap values compared to Molecule 1.
Rule 2: The conjugation effect between multiple double bonds or aromatic rings in a molecule can also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap value. Conjugation allows for electron delocalization across multiple double bonds or aromatic rings, resulting in a decrease in energy required for electronic transitions. Therefore, molecules with conjugated systems tend to have smaller HOMO-LUMO gap values than those without them. For instance, Molecule 21 has two conjugated double bonds and has a small HOMO-LUMO gap value of 6.24 eV while Molecule 22 has no conjugated system and has a higher HOMO-LUMO gap value of

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyl, nitro, and cyano groups increases the HOMO-LUMO gap value due to the decrease in the energy of the LUMO orbital. For example, the first molecule has a lower HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to the last two molecules because it does not have any electron-withdrawing group.
Rule 2: The presence of electron-donating groups such as alkyl or aryl groups decreases the HOMO-LUMO gap value due to the increase in the energy of the HOMO orbital. For example, the third molecule has a higher HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to the second molecule because it has an alkyl group instead of an aryl group.
Rule 3: The conjugation effect also affects the HOMO-LUMO gap value. When there is a continuous chain of π-bonds between two atoms, the electrons can move easily from one atom to another, resulting in a decrease in the HOMO-LUMO gap value. For example, the sixth molecule has a lower HOMO-LUMO gap value than the seventh molecule because it has a conjugated system.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine in a molecule tends to decrease its HOMO-LUMO gap value due to increased electron delocalization. For example, compare the HOMO-LUMO gaps of CO (8.08 eV) vs OC (7.03 eV); ONO (6.24 eV) vs NNO (5.28 eV) etc.
Rule 2: Conjugation between pi bonds in a molecule can also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap value. The more extended the conjugation, the lower the HOMO-LUMO gap value. For instance, compare the HOMO-LUMO gaps of CC (7.31 eV) vs CCO (8.57 eV); CCC (7.30 eV) vs ccccc (4.93 eV) etc.
Rule 3: The presence of heteroatoms such as nitrogen or sulfur in a ring system can increase its HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to a similar hydrocarbon ring without these atoms. This is because the lone pair electrons on the heteroatom occupy higher energy levels than the pi orbitals, resulting in less overlap and reduced conjugation. For example, compare the HOMO-LUMO gaps of benzene (8.01 eV) vs pyridine (9.14 eV); thiophene (7.41 eV) vs furan (6.07 eV) etc.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine in a molecule can significantly reduce its HOMO-LUMO gap value due to the difference in electronegativity between these atoms and carbon. For example, the first four molecules have relatively low HOMO-LUMO gaps compared to the rest of the dataset.
Rule 2: The conjugation of pi bonds in a molecule can also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap value. In general, conjugated systems tend to have lower HOMO-LUMO gaps than non-conjugated ones. This is because the delocalization of electrons across multiple pi bonds leads to a decrease in energy for both the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). For instance, the fifth molecule has a relatively high LUMO energy level due to the extended conjugation of its pi system, resulting in a small HOMO-LUMO gap.
Rule 3: The geometry of a molecule can also play a role in determining its HOMO-LUMO gap value. Planar or nearly planar structures tend to have smaller HOMO-LUMO gaps than bent or twisted geometries due to the increased overlap of p orbitals in the former case. For example, the last two molecules have highly strained ring structures which lead to significant bending of the C-C-X angles (where X is O or N), resulting in higher HOMO-LUMO gaps.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyl, cyano, or nitro groups decreases the HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because these groups withdraw electrons from the conjugated system, making it easier for them to be excited into higher energy levels. For example, in molecule number 1, the presence of the carbonyl group reduces the HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to other molecules without this functional group.
Rule 2: The presence of electron-donating groups such as alkyl or alkoxy groups increases the HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because these groups donate electrons to the conjugated system, making it harder for them to be excited into higher energy levels. For example, in molecule number 11, the presence of the methoxy group increases the HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to other molecules without this functional group.
Rule 3: The length of the conjugated system also affects the HOMO-LUMO gap value. As the conjugation length increases, the HOMO-LUMO gap value decreases due to increased delocalization of π-electrons. For example, in molecule numbers 1 and 12, the longer conjugation length results in a lower HOMO-LUMO gap value than those with shorter conjugation lengths.

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the HOMO-LUMO gap value of a molecule based on its structure:
1. Rule 1: The presence of multiple conjugated double bonds in a molecule tends to decrease the HOMO-LUMO gap value due to increased delocalization of electrons. For example, the molecule C=C=C has a lower HOMO-LUMO gap value than C≡C or C−C.
2. Rule 2: The presence of heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur in a molecule also affects the HOMO-LUMO gap value. Heteroatoms have different electronegativities compared to carbon, which leads to polarization of electron density and changes in bond energies. For instance, the molecule COOH has a higher HOMO-LUMO gap value than CH3COOH because of the absence of conjugation between the carbonyl group and the hydroxyl group.
3. Rule 3: The geometry of a molecule also plays a role in determining the HOMO-LUMO gap value. Planar molecules tend to have smaller HOMO-LUMO gaps than nonplanar ones due to increased π-conjugation. For example, the molecule biphenyl has a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap value than benzene due to the presence of two phenyl rings that are coplanar.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine in a molecule tends to decrease its HOMO-LUMO gap value due to increased electron delocalization. For example, the first molecule has an electronegative atom (oxygen) attached to the carbon atom, which results in a lower HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to other molecules without any electronegative atoms.
Rule 2: The presence of multiple conjugated double bonds in a molecule also decreases its HOMO-LUMO gap value because it increases electron delocalization. For instance, the third molecule has two conjugated double bonds between the carbon atoms, resulting in a low HOMO-LUMO gap value.
Rule 3: The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule can increase its HOMO-LUMO gap value due to decreased electron delocalization. For example, the last molecule has an aromatic ring, which leads to a higher HOMO-LUMO gap value than other non-aromatic molecules.

================================

Step 1: Analyze the given data and identify any patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their respective HOMO-LUMO gaps.
Step 2: Identify three specific structural features that appear frequently in the molecules with smaller HOMO-LUMO gaps, i.e., those that are more reactive. These could be functional groups such as carbonyls, nitro groups, or amines.
Step 3: Based on these observations, formulate three rules that can help predict the reactivity of a molecule based on its structure:
Rule 1: Molecules containing functional groups such as carbonyls, nitro groups, or amines tend to have smaller HOMO-LUMO gaps and therefore higher reactivity compared to other types of molecules.
Rule 2: Molecules with multiple conjugated double bonds also tend to have smaller HOMO-LUMO gaps and higher reactivity due to increased delocalization of electrons.
Rule 3: Molecules with electronegative atoms such as oxygen or nitrogen tend to have smaller HOMO-LUMO gaps and higher reactivity because they can stabilize the LUMO by accepting electron density from the HOMO.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen in a molecule tends to decrease its HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because these atoms have a higher electron affinity than carbon, which causes a shift in the molecular orbitals towards lower energies. For example, FC(F)(F)[C@H]1C[C@H]2N[C@H]21 has three fluorine atoms and has a relatively low HOMO-LUMO gap value of 8.43 eV compared to other molecules in the dataset.
Rule 2: The presence of pi bonds between carbon atoms also decreases the HOMO-LUMO gap value due to the formation of delocalized molecular orbitals. For instance, C[C@@H]1CCC12CCCC2 has two pi bonds and has a high HOMO-LUMO gap value of 9.46 eV.
Rule 3: The presence of charged functional groups such as ammonium or amine groups increases the HOMO-LUMO gap value since they require additional energy to remove electrons from the molecule. For example, CO[CH+][NH2+]C1C[NH+](C)C1 has two positively charged ammonium groups and has a relatively high HOMO-LUMO gap value of 6.40 eV.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine in a molecule tends to decrease its HOMO-LUMO gap value due to increased electron delocalization. For example, the first four molecules have relatively low HOMO-LUMO gaps compared to the rest of the dataset.
Rule 2: Conjugation between multiple double bonds or aromatic rings can also lower the HOMO-LUMO gap by increasing electron delocalization. This is evident from the fact that the fifth molecule has one conjugated double bond which results in a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap than the sixth molecule which does not contain any conjugation.
Rule 3: The shape and size of the molecule can also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap. Generally, larger molecules tend to have higher HOMO-LUMO gaps since they require more energy to excite electrons across the gap. Additionally, planar molecules tend to have lower HOMO-LUMO gaps than non-planar ones because of increased π-electron delocalization. This is observed in the case of the seventh molecule which contains two fused benzene rings and has a significantly lower HOMO-LUMO gap than the eighth molecule which only has one benzene ring.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine in a molecule tends to decrease its HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because these atoms have a higher electron affinity than carbon, which causes a shift in the molecular orbitals towards lower energies. For example, the first four molecules listed in the table contain at least one oxygen atom and they all have relatively low HOMO-LUMO gap values compared to the other molecules.
Rule 2: The number and position of double bonds in a molecule can also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap value. Generally, increasing the number of double bonds leads to a decrease in the HOMO-LUMO gap value due to increased conjugation and stabilization of the molecule's electronic structure. For instance, the fifth molecule has two double bonds between the carbon atoms and it has a significantly smaller HOMO-LUMO gap value than the sixth molecule, which only contains one double bond.
Rule 3: The type of hybridization of the carbon atoms in a molecule can also influence its HOMO-LUMO gap value. In general, sp2 hybridized carbon atoms tend to have larger HOMO-LUMO gaps than sp3 hybridized ones since the former have a more planar geometry and less steric hindrance. For example, the third molecule has three sp2 hybridized carbon atoms and it has a much larger HOMO-LUMO gap value than the seventh molecule, which has five sp3 hybridized carbon atoms.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine in a molecule tends to decrease its HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because these atoms have a higher electron affinity than carbon, which causes a shift in the molecular orbitals towards lower energies. For example, compare the HOMO-LUMO gaps of compounds 1 and 2, where compound 1 has no electronegative atom and compound 2 has two oxygen atoms. Compound 2 has a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to compound 1 due to the presence of oxygen atoms.
Rule 2: The presence of multiple bonds between carbon atoms also decreases the HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because multiple bonds have a higher degree of conjugation, which leads to a more delocalized electronic structure and a lower energy difference between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals. For example, compare the HOMO-LUMO gaps of compounds 3 and 4, where compound 3 has only single bonds and compound 4 has double bonds. Compound 4 has a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to compound 3 due to the presence of double bonds.
Rule 3: The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule increases its HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because aromatic rings have a more stable electronic structure due to the delocalization of π-electrons over the entire ring. Therefore, it requires more energy to excite electrons from the highest occupied to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. For example, compare the HOMO-LUMO gaps of compounds 5 and 6, where compound 5

================================

Rule 1: The presence of heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur in a molecule can significantly affect its HOMO-LUMO gap value. For example, the first four molecules have relatively low HOMO-LUMO gaps compared to the rest due to the presence of oxygen atoms. Similarly, the last two molecules have high HOMO-LUMO gaps because they do not contain any heteroatoms.
Rule 2: The type of bonding between atoms also affects the HOMO-LUMO gap value. In general, single bonds tend to have higher HOMO-LUMO gaps than double or triple bonds. This is evident from comparing the second and third molecules where the former has a lower HOMO-LUMO gap due to the presence of a double bond.
Rule 3: The molecular geometry of a compound can also influence its HOMO-LUMO gap value. For instance, the fifth molecule has a bent structure which may cause a decrease in its HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to other linear molecules like the sixth one.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine in a molecule can increase its HOMO-LUMO gap value due to the difference in electronegativity between these atoms and carbon. This results in a decrease in the electron density around the heteroatom which makes it less reactive towards other molecules.
Example: Molecule 1 has two heteroatoms (oxygen and nitrogen) and its HOMO-LUMO gap value is 8.751182 eV. Molecule 2 does not have any heteroatoms and its HOMO-LUMO gap value is 8.977036 eV. Therefore, the presence of heteroatoms increases the HOMO-LUMO gap value by about 0.2 eV.
Rule 2: The presence of multiple bonds between carbon atoms in a molecule can also increase its HOMO-LUMO gap value because they require more energy to break the pi bond compared to single bonds.
Example: Molecule 3 has a triple bond between carbon atoms and its HOMO-LUMO gap value is 6.598761 eV. Molecule 4 has a double bond between carbon atoms and its HOMO-LUMO gap value is 8.696758 eV. Therefore, the presence of a triple bond increases the HOMO-LUMO gap value by about 2 eV compared to a double bond.
Rule 3: The shape and size of a molecule can also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap value. For example, if a molecule has a non-planar structure, it may have a lower HOMO-LU

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine in a molecule tends to decrease its HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because these atoms have a higher electron affinity than carbon, which causes a shift in the molecular orbitals towards lower energies. For example, the first three molecules listed have relatively low HOMO-LUMO gaps due to the presence of oxygen atoms.
Rule 2: The conjugation of double bonds in a molecule also affects its HOMO-LUMO gap value. Conjugation involves the overlap of p-orbitals on adjacent double bonds, which allows for delocalization of electrons across multiple bonds. This leads to a decrease in the energy difference between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, resulting in a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap. For instance, the fourth molecule has a high degree of conjugation, which contributes to its small HOMO-LUMO gap.
Rule 3: The geometry of a molecule can also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap value. Planar or rigid structures tend to have larger HOMO-LUMO gaps compared to nonplanar or flexible ones. This is because planarity allows for better orbital overlap and delocalization of electrons, leading to a more stable electronic structure. For example, the last two molecules listed have large HOMO-LUMO gaps due to their rigid and planar structures.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen or fluorine in a molecule can increase its HOMO-LUMO gap value due to the difference in electronegativity between these atoms and carbon. For example, the first four molecules have relatively high HOMO-LUMO gaps compared to the rest of the molecules listed because they contain at least one nitrogen atom.
Rule 2: Conjugation can also affect the HOMO-LUMO gap value by allowing for electron delocalization across multiple double bonds. Molecules with extended conjugation tend to have lower HOMO-LUMO gap values than those without it. For instance, the last two molecules have low HOMO-LUMO gap values due to their highly conjugated structures.
Rule 3: The geometry of a molecule can also play a role in determining its HOMO-LUMO gap value. Planar molecules with extended conjugation tend to have lower HOMO-LUMO gap values than non-planar ones since planarity allows for more efficient electron delocalization. For example, the second molecule has a higher HOMO-LUMO gap value than the third molecule despite having similar functional groups because the former is not planar while the latter is.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electron withdrawing groups such as carbonyl, nitro, and cyano groups tend to decrease the HOMO-LUMO gap values while the presence of electron donating groups like alkyl or alkoxy groups increase them. This is because electron withdrawing groups attract electrons from the neighboring atoms making it easier for them to be excited into higher energy levels resulting in lower HOMO-LUMO gaps. On the other hand, electron donating groups release electrons making it harder for them to be excited leading to higher HOMO-LUMO gaps.
Example: Molecule 1 has a HOMO-LUMO gap value of 8.46 eV which is relatively high compared to most of the other molecules listed due to the absence of any strong electron withdrawing or donating groups. In contrast, Molecule 10 has a low HOMO-LUMO gap value of 5.03 eV due to the presence of two strongly electron withdrawing cyano groups.
Rule 2: The number and position of double bonds also affect the HOMO-LUMO gap values. Generally, increasing the number of double bonds decreases the HOMO-LUMO gap values since they provide additional conjugation pathways for electrons to move around. Additionally, the position of the double bond can also have an impact on the electronic structure of the molecule. For example, Molecule 13 has a much smaller HOMO-LUMO gap than Molecule 14 despite having similar functional groups due to the different positions of the double bond.
Rule 3: The type of hybridization of the carbon atom affects the HOMO-LUMO gap values. sp3 hybridized carbons typically have larger HOMO-LUMO gap values than sp2 or sp

================================

Rule 1: The presence of multiple conjugated double bonds in a molecule tends to decrease its HOMO-LUMO gap value, making it easier for electrons to move from one end of the molecule to another. This can be seen in molecules such as N=CN(C=N)C(N)=O, O=C1[C@H]2N[C@@H]1[C@]2(O)CO, CCC1(C2(C)CC2)CC1, C[C@]12C[C@]3(C#N)C14OC423, CO[C@H]1CC2(CC2)C1=O, O=C1NCCC[C@H]2N[C@@H]12, C1=CC[C@@H]2OC[C@H](C1)O2, C[C@H]1COC[C@H]1C1CC1, NCC(C)(C)CN, CNC(C#N)(CN)CN, NC[C@H]1ON=CMe2, CC(C)n1ncoc1=O, C[C@@H]1C=C[C@@]2(CCO2)C1, CC(C)OC[C@@H](N)C#N, C[C@H]1[C@@]2(C)O[C@H]2[C@@]12

================================

Rule 1: The presence of heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur in a molecule can increase its HOMO-LUMO gap value due to the difference in electronegativity between these atoms and carbon. This results in a decrease in the electron density around the π-bonds, making it harder for electrons to move from one orbital to another.
Example: Molecule 1 has two carbonyl groups which contain oxygen atoms. Its HOMO-LUMO gap value is 5.92 eV, higher than other molecules without any heteroatoms.
Rule 2: The number and position of double bonds in a molecule can also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap value. A molecule with more conjugated double bonds will have a lower HOMO-LUMO gap value because it allows for easier movement of electrons across multiple π-bonds.
Example: Molecule 2 has a cyano group attached to a cyclopropene ring, which contains three conjugated double bonds. Its HOMO-LUMO gap value is 5.80 eV, much lower than other molecules without any conjugated double bonds.
Rule 3: The presence of substituents such as alkyl or aryl groups on a molecule can also influence its HOMO-LUMO gap value by altering the electronic environment around the π-bonds. Electron-donating groups such as alkyl groups can reduce the energy required to excite electrons while electron-withdrawing groups such as aryl groups can increase this energy requirement.
Example: Molecule 3 has a carbonyl group connected to a phenyl ring, which is an electron-withdrawing substituent. Its HOMO-LUMO gap value is 6.22 eV, slightly higher than other molecules without

================================

Rule 1: The presence of heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine in a molecule can increase its HOMO-LUMO gap value due to the difference in electronegativity between these atoms and carbon. This results in a decrease in the electron density around the π-bonds, making it harder for electrons to move from one orbital to another.
Example: Molecule 1 has two oxygen atoms which have higher electronegativity than carbon, resulting in a larger HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to other molecules without any heteroatoms.
Rule 2: The number and position of double bonds in a molecule can also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap value. As the number of double bonds increases, the energy required to excite an electron from the ground state to the excited state decreases, leading to a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap value. Additionally, the position of the double bond can also influence the electronic distribution within the molecule, affecting its HOMO-LUMO gap value.
Example: Molecule 2 has three double bonds, resulting in a lower HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to Molecule 3 which only has one double bond.
Rule 3: The presence of cyclic structures in a molecule can also impact its HOMO-LUMO gap value by altering the electronic distribution within the molecule. For example, ring strain caused by the presence of small rings can lead to a decrease in the HOMO-LUMO gap value.
Example: Molecule 10 contains a five-membered ring which causes ring strain, resulting in a relatively low HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to other molecules without any cyclic structures.

================================

Rule 1: A molecule with a higher number of π bonds generally has a lower HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because the energy required for electrons to move from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is lower due to the increased conjugation of the system. For example, in the first molecule, there are two double bonds between carbon atoms which results in a low HOMO-LUMO gap value of 6.86 eV. In contrast, the last molecule does not have any π bonds and therefore has a high HOMO-LUMO gap value of 8.33 eV.
Rule 2: The presence of electronegative elements such as oxygen or nitrogen can also affect the HOMO-LUMO gap value. These elements increase the polarity of the molecule and cause a decrease in the HOMO-LUMO gap value. For instance, the second molecule contains an oxygen atom which decreases its HOMO-LUMO gap value to 6.17 eV compared to the first molecule.
Rule 3: The type of hybridization of the atoms in the molecule can also influence the HOMO-LUMO gap value. For example, sp3 hybridized atoms tend to have a larger HOMO-LUMO gap value than sp2 hybridized atoms since they require more energy to excite the electrons. Therefore, the third molecule with sp3 hybridized carbon atoms has a relatively large HOMO-LUMO gap value of 5.77 eV.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine in a molecule tends to increase its HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because these atoms have a higher electron affinity than carbon, which causes a shift in the molecular orbitals towards lower energies. Therefore, the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) increases. For example, the first three molecules in the table contain at least one oxygen atom and have relatively high HOMO-LUMO gap values compared to other molecules in the list.
Rule 2: The number and position of double bonds in a molecule can also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap value. Generally, increasing the number of double bonds leads to a decrease in the HOMO-LUMO gap value due to increased conjugation and delocalization of electrons. However, this effect may be counteracted by the presence of electronegative atoms, as mentioned above. Additionally, the position of double bonds can also play a role in determining the electronic structure of a molecule. For instance, the fourth molecule in the table has two double bonds but a relatively low HOMO-LUMO gap value, likely due to the proximity of the double bonds leading to greater conjugation.
Rule 3: The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule can also impact its HOMO-LUMO gap value. Aromatic compounds tend to have lower HOMO-LUMO gap values than non-aromatic ones due to the stabilization of the π-electrons through resonance. For example, the last four molecules in the table all contain aromatic rings and have relatively low HOMO-LUMO gap values compared to other molecules

================================

Rule 1: The presence of multiple conjugated double bonds in a molecule tends to decrease its HOMO-LUMO gap value, making it easier for electrons to move from one end of the molecule to another. This can be seen in molecules such as CC1=CCC=CC(C)=C1, O[C@H]1CC2(CCC2)[C@H]1O, NC(=O)C1CN(C=O)C1, Cn1ncc(F)nc1=O, C#Cc1cnc(O)nn1, COCC[C@@H]1C=CCC1, C#C[C@]1(O)C[C@]1(O)C#N, CC[N@H+]1C[C@H]1[C@@H](N)C#N, CCc1cc(=O)nc[nH]1, c1ncc2c[nH]cc2[nH+]1, CC#Cc1ccoc1, C[C@@]1(C2CC2)NCC1=O, C[C@@H](CO)[C@H]1CCC1=O, C[C@H]1[C@@](C)(O)[C@]1(C)CO, C[C@]12C[N@@H+]3[C@H]1[C@@H]3CO2, C#CC

================================

Based on the given data, here are three rules that can be inferred to predict the HOMO-LUMO gap value of a molecule based on its structure:
1. Rule 1: The presence of electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyl (C=O) or cyano (CN) increases the HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to other functional groups like alkene (C=C) or alkyne (C≡C). For example, the first molecule has a C=O group and has a higher HOMO-LUMO gap value than the second molecule which does not have any electron-withdrawing groups.
2. Rule 2: The position of the substituent also affects the HOMO-LUMO gap value. If the substituent is attached to an sp3 carbon atom, it will increase the HOMO-LUMO gap value more than if it is attached to an sp2 carbon atom. This is because the p-orbital of an sp3 carbon atom is less stable than the p-orbital of an sp2 carbon atom due to the tetrahedral geometry. For instance, the third molecule has a COOH group attached to an sp3 carbon atom and has a higher HOMO-LUMO gap value than the fourth molecule which has a COOH group attached to an sp2 carbon atom.
3. Rule 3: The number and type of bonds between atoms in a molecule also affect the HOMO-LUMO gap value. A double bond (C=C) or triple bond (C

================================

Step 1: Analyze the given dataset and identify any patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their respective HOMO-LUMO gaps.
Step 2: Identify three distinct structural features that appear frequently in the molecules with smaller HOMO-LUMO gaps, i.e., those that have higher reactivity. These could be functional groups such as carbonyls, double bonds, or triple bonds.
Rule 1: Molecules containing conjugated systems tend to have lower HOMO-LUMO gaps than non-conjugated ones due to increased delocalization of electrons across multiple π-bonds. For example, molecules with a carbon-carbon double bond adjacent to another double bond (such as in C=C-C=O) have a lower HOMO-LUMO gap compared to those with only one double bond (such as in CH2=C=O). Therefore, it can be inferred that conjugation lowers the energy required for electron transfer between orbitals, making the molecule more reactive.
Rule 2: The presence of electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine in a molecule can also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap by increasing the polarity of the molecule's bonds and stabilizing the LUMO orbital through induction effects. This results in a decrease in the HOMO-LUMO gap and an increase in reactivity. For instance, comparing the HOMO-LUMO gaps of CO2 and N2O shows that the latter has a significantly lower gap due to the presence of the electronegative nitrogen atom.
Rule 3: Aromatic compounds generally have lower HOMO-LUMO gaps than non-aromatic ones because of the stabilization of the LUMO

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electron-withdrawing groups such as carbonyl, cyano, or nitro groups decreases the HOMO-LUMO gap value due to increased stabilization of the LUMO energy level. For example, in molecule number 1, the presence of two carbonyl groups significantly lowers the HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to other molecules without these functional groups.
Rule 2: The presence of electron-donating groups such as alkyl or aryl groups increases the HOMO-LUMO gap value due to decreased stabilization of the HOMO energy level. For example, in molecule number 11, the absence of any electron-donating group results in a lower HOMO-LUMO gap value than those containing alkyl or aryl groups.
Rule 3: The conjugation length of the molecule also affects the HOMO-LUMO gap value. Longer conjugation lengths result in smaller HOMO-LUMO gap values because it allows for more efficient delocalization of electrons throughout the molecule. For example, in molecule number 12, the longer conjugated system leads to a much smaller HOMO-LUMO gap value than others with shorter conjugation lengths.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electron withdrawing groups such as carbonyl, nitro, and cyano groups tend to decrease the HOMO-LUMO gap values while the presence of electron donating groups like alkyl or alkoxy groups increase it. This is because electron withdrawing groups attract electrons from the neighboring atoms making them more electronegative which results in a higher energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). On the other hand, electron donating groups release electrons into the system causing a lower energy difference between the two orbitals.
Rule 2: The number and position of heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine also affect the HOMO-LUMO gap values. For example, the molecule with the lowest HOMO-LUMO gap value has three nitrogen atoms arranged in a linear fashion. Similarly, the molecule with the second-lowest HOMO-LUMO gap value contains one oxygen atom and one fluorine atom attached to adjacent carbon atoms.
Rule 3: The conjugation of pi bonds affects the HOMO-LUMO gap values significantly. Molecules with extended conjugated systems have lower HOMO-LUMO gap values due to the increased delocalization of electrons across multiple pi bonds.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen in a molecule tends to decrease its HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because these atoms have a higher electron affinity than carbon, which causes the LUMO energy level to drop, resulting in a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap. For example, FC(F)(F)[C@H]1C[C@H]2O[C@H]21 has a lower HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to CC(=O)[C@H]1C[C@@H](CO)C1 due to the presence of two fluorine atoms in the former.
Rule 2: The number and position of double bonds in a molecule also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap value. Generally, increasing the number of double bonds leads to a larger HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because the π orbitals involved in double bonds have a lower energy level than single bonds, causing the LUMO energy level to rise, resulting in a larger HOMO-LUMO gap. Additionally, the position of double bonds can also influence the HOMO-LUMO gap value. For instance, CCCc1cnc[nH]1 has a lower HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to CCO[C@H]1C[C@H]2[C@@H](C)[C@H]21 despite having one more double bond, likely due to the different positions of the double bonds.
Rule 3: The presence of charged

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen in a molecule can increase its HOMO-LUMO gap value due to the electron-withdrawing effect they have on the molecule's electronic structure. For example, the first four molecules listed in the table all contain at least one electronegative atom and have higher HOMO-LUMO gap values than the other molecules.
Rule 2: The number and position of double bonds in a molecule can also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap value. Conjugation between multiple double bonds can lower the energy of the LUMO and raise the energy of the HOMO, resulting in a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is evident in the last two molecules listed in the table, which both contain conjugated double bonds and have relatively low HOMO-LUMO gap values compared to the others.
Rule 3: The presence of charged functional groups such as ammonium or carboxylate ions can decrease the HOMO-LUMO gap value by introducing additional electronic states into the molecule's electronic structure. This is seen in the third and eighth molecules listed in the table, which both contain charged functional groups and have significantly lower HOMO-LUMO gap values than the neutral molecules.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen or fluorine in a molecule can significantly reduce its HOMO-LUMO gap value due to their electronegativity difference from carbon atoms. For example, the first molecule has a high HOMO-LUMO gap value of 7.96 eV because it does not contain any heteroatom. On the other hand, the last two molecules have low HOMO-LUMO gap values of 5.02 eV and 5.39 eV respectively due to the presence of nitrogen and fluorine atoms.
Rule 2: The conjugation effect between multiple double bonds or aromatic rings in a molecule can also decrease its HOMO-LUMO gap value. For instance, the second molecule has a lower HOMO-LUMO gap value of 6.49 eV compared to the first one due to the conjugation effect between the benzene ring and the double bond. Similarly, the thirteenth molecule has a very low HOMO-LUMO gap value of 5.44 eV due to the extended conjugation effect within the naphthalene ring.
Rule 3: The molecular geometry and symmetry of a molecule can also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap value. For example, the sixth molecule has a relatively higher HOMO-LUMO gap value of 6.07 eV than the seventh molecule despite having similar functional groups since the former has a more symmetric structure which reduces the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electronegative atoms such as fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen in a molecule tends to decrease its HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because these atoms have a higher electron affinity than carbon, which causes a shift in the molecular orbitals towards lower energies. For example, Oc1cnc(F)c(F)n1 has a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to C#C[C@H]1N[C@H]2[C@@H](C#N)[C@H]21 due to the presence of two fluorine atoms.
Rule 2: The number and position of double bonds in a molecule also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap value. Generally, increasing the number of double bonds increases the HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because the π-bonding orbitals become more stable while the π*-antibonding orbitals become less stable, resulting in a larger energy difference between them. For instance, CO[C@H](C=O)C[C@@H](C)O has a larger HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to O=C1C=CNC12CCC2 due to the presence of one double bond instead of three.
Rule 3: The type of hybridization of the atoms in a molecule can also influence its HOMO-LUMO gap value. For example, CC[C@H]1[C@H]2O[C@@H]1[C@H]

================================

Rule 1: The presence of heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine in a molecule can increase its HOMO-LUMO gap value due to the difference in electronegativity between these atoms and carbon. For example, the first four molecules have relatively high HOMO-LUMO gaps compared to other molecules in the list because they contain oxygen or nitrogen atoms.
Rule 2: The conjugation of double bonds in a molecule can decrease its HOMO-LUMO gap value since it allows for more efficient electron delocalization across multiple bonds. This effect is observed in the last two molecules where the conjugated system leads to lower values of HOMO-LUMO gap.
Rule 3: The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule can also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap value by increasing the stability of the molecule through resonance stabilization. In this case, the fifth molecule has a higher HOMO-LUMO gap than the sixth one despite having similar functional groups.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine in a molecule can increase its HOMO-LUMO gap value due to the difference in electronegativity between these atoms and carbon. This results in a decrease in the electron density around the central atom which makes it less reactive towards other molecules.
Example: Molecule 1 has no heteroatom and has a low HOMO-LUMO gap value of 6.23 eV while molecule 2 contains two nitrogens and has a higher HOMO-LUMO gap value of 8.24 eV.
Rule 2: The presence of multiple bonds between carbon atoms in a molecule can also increase its HOMO-LUMO gap value because they require more energy to break the pi bond compared to single bonds.
Example: Molecule 3 has one double bond between carbon atoms and has a high HOMO-LUMO gap value of 8.34 eV while molecule 4 has only single bonds and has a lower HOMO-LUMO gap value of 6.25 eV.
Rule 3: The shape and size of a molecule can also affect its HOMO-LUMO gap value. For example, linear molecules have smaller HOMO-LUMO gaps than bent or cyclic molecules since they have fewer degrees of freedom for electrons to move around.
Example: Molecule 5 has a small HOMO-LUMO gap value of 5.26 eV while molecule 6 has a larger HOMO-LUMO gap value of 6.97 eV despite having similar functional groups.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electron withdrawing groups such as carbonyl, nitro, and cyano groups in a molecule tends to decrease its HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because these groups pull electrons away from the rest of the molecule, making it more difficult for them to move around freely. Therefore, they increase the energy required to excite the molecule, resulting in a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap value. For example, in the first molecule, the two carbonyl groups present in the molecule contribute to the small HOMO-LUMO gap value of 6.87 eV.
Rule 2: The presence of electron donating groups such as alkyl, alkoxy, and amino groups in a molecule tends to increase its HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because these groups add electrons to the molecule, making it easier for them to move around freely. Therefore, they decrease the energy required to excite the molecule, resulting in a larger HOMO-LUMO gap value. For example, in the third molecule, the two amine groups present in the molecule contribute to the large HOMO-LUMO gap value of 7.88 eV.
Rule 3: The presence of conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings in a molecule tends to decrease its HOMO-LUMO gap value. This is because these structures allow for efficient delocalization of π-electrons throughout the molecule, which makes it easier for them to move around freely. Therefore, they require less energy to excite the molecule, resulting in a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap value. For example, in the eighth molecule, the benzene ring present in the molecule contributes to the small HOMO-LUMO gap value of 

================================

Step 1: Analyze the given data and identify any patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their respective HOMO-LUMO gaps.
Step 2: Identify three distinct structural features that appear frequently among the molecules, such as functional groups, ring systems, and heteroatoms.
Step 3: Based on these identified features, formulate three rules that can be used to predict the HOMO-LUMO gap values for new molecules based on their structure.
Rule 1: The presence of electron-withdrawing groups, such as carbonyls (C=O), increases the HOMO-LUMO gap value due to the increased energy required to remove electrons from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Conversely, the presence of electron-donating groups, such as amines (NH2), decreases the HOMO-LUMO gap value due to the decreased energy required to add electrons to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).
Rule 2: The size of the conjugated system, i.e., the number of adjacent double bonds, also affects the HOMO-LUMO gap value. As the conjugation length increases, the HOMO-LUMO gap value decreases due to the increased overlap between the p orbitals and the delocalization of π electrons throughout the entire system.
Rule 3: Heteroatoms, such as nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O), can also affect the HOMO-LUMO gap value by altering the electronic distribution within the molecule. For example, the presence of an electronegative atom, such as oxygen, can increase the LUMO energy level and

================================

Rule 1: The presence of electron withdrawing groups such as carbonyl, nitro, and halogen groups increases the HOMO-LUMO gap value due to the decrease in the energy of LUMO. For example, NC1=NCC(=O)C1=O has a higher HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to N#CC1[NH2+][C@H]2[C@@H](O)[C@H]2O1 because of the presence of two carbonyl groups which withdraw electrons from the molecule.
Rule 2: The presence of electron donating groups such as amino, alkyl, and alkoxy groups decreases the HOMO-LUMO gap value due to the increase in the energy of HOMO. For example, C[C@H]1OC[C@H]1CO[CH+][NH-] has a lower HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to CC1=C[C@H]2O[C@@]13CO[C@@H]23 because of the presence of an amino group which donates electrons to the molecule.
Rule 3: The presence of conjugated systems such as double bonds, triple bonds, and aromatic rings also decreases the HOMO-LUMO gap value due to the delocalization of π-electrons throughout the system. For example, O=CC[C@@H](C=O)[NH+]1CC1 has a lower HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to COC[C@H]1CN(C)C1=O because
