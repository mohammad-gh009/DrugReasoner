Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in a molecule may indicate its ability to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules S and O.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a five-membered ring with two double bonds (cyclopentadiene) may not be able to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecule F.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a positively charged nitrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom, which is also bonded to another oxygen or fluorine atom, then it may have the potential to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules P and Q.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a functional group such as -COOH or -CONH2 in a molecule may increase its ability to inhibit BACE-1. This is because these groups can form hydrogen bonds with active site residues of BACE-1 and enhance binding affinity. However, this rule should not be used as the sole criterion for predicting inhibition since other factors such as molecular size, shape, and hydrophobicity also play important roles.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a heterocyclic ring system such as thiophene, pyridine, or indole may have higher chances of inhibiting BACE-1 compared to those without such rings. This is likely due to the increased flexibility and polarity of the molecules caused by the heteroatoms present in the rings.
Rule 3: A molecule with a polar functional group such as -OH or -NH2 attached to a phenyl ring may have better inhibitory activity against BACE-1 than one with a nonpolar alkyl chain at the same position. This is because the polar group can interact with charged amino acid residues in the active site of BACE-1 through electrostatic interactions.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the structure of a molecule may indicate its ability to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules #5 and #6 which have a C=O group attached to a five-membered ring. However, this rule does not apply to all molecules containing a C=O group as seen in molecule #8 where the C=O group is part of a six-membered ring.
Rule 2: A fluorine atom on the para position of a benzene ring may increase the likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1. Molecules #9 and #17 contain such a functional group and both have been labeled as inhibitors of BACE-1. However, this rule should be used cautiously since other factors such as the overall structure and charge of the molecule also play a role in determining its inhibitory activity.
Rule 3: The presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom in the structure of a molecule may suggest its potential to inhibit BACE-1. Molecule #1 contains a protonated amine group and has been labeled as an inhibitor of BACE-1. However, this rule should also be used carefully because some negatively charged or neutral molecules may also exhibit inhibitory activity against BACE-1.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in conjugation with a double bond or aromatic ring increases the likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1 activity. This is because the C=O group acts as an electron-withdrawing group which stabilizes the positive charge on the adjacent carbon atom and enhances the interaction between the inhibitor and the active site of BACE-1.
Rule 2: The presence of a heterocyclic ring such as thiophene, furan, or pyridine also increases the likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1 activity. These rings have a higher degree of polarizability than benzene, making them more susceptible to interactions with polar groups in the active site of BACE-1.
Rule 3: The presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom in the structure of the inhibitor increases its affinity for the negatively charged active site of BACE-1. This is because the amino acid residues in the active site of BACE-1 are predominantly negatively charged, and the positively charged nitrogen atom can form electrostatic interactions with these residues.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of fluorine atoms in the structure may increase the likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1 activity.
Explanation: Fluorine has a high electronegativity and can affect the electronic distribution within the molecule, which could potentially interact with the active site of BACE-1. However, this rule should not be considered as a definitive predictor since other factors such as molecular size, shape, and hydrophobicity also play important roles in determining the inhibitory potency against BACE-1.
Rule 2: The presence of a cyclic amine group or a guanidine group in the structure may increase the likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1 activity.
Explanation: These functional groups can form hydrogen bonds with the active site of BACE-1, which can enhance the binding affinity between the inhibitor and the enzyme. Again, this rule should not be considered as a definitive predictor because other factors such as molecular size and charge distribution can also influence the inhibitory potency against BACE-1.
Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group adjacent to a double bond in the structure may decrease the likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1 activity.
Explanation: This functional group can undergo a nucleophilic attack by the catalytic aspartic acid residues in the active site of BACE-1, leading to a covalent bond formation and reducing the ability of the inhibitor to bind non-covalently. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group may have lower inhibitory potency against BACE-1 compared to those without it.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a sulfonamide group present in the structure of a molecule, then it can potentially inhibit BACE-1. The presence of this functional group is indicated by the S(=O)(=O)N(R) part of the SMILES string.
Rule 2: If there is a carbonyl group present in the structure of a molecule and it is conjugated with another double bond or aromatic ring, then it may not be able to inhibit BACE-1. This is because conjugation can make the carbonyl group less reactive. The absence of such conjugation is indicated by the C=X part of the SMILES string where X is either O or N.
Rule 3: If there is a fluorine atom present on one of the carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl group in the structure of a molecule, then it may enhance the ability of the molecule to inhibit BACE-1. This is because fluorine has a strong electronegativity and can affect the electronic environment around the carbonyl group. The presence of a fluorine atom is indicated by F next to the carbon atom in the SMILES string.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the structure of a molecule may indicate its ability to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules 4 and 5 as they both have a C=O group present in their structures. However, this rule does not apply to all molecules containing a C=O group because other factors such as the position and orientation of the functional group also play a role in determining its inhibitory activity towards BACE-1.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a positively charged nitrogen atom (NH2+ or NR2+) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a double bond may exhibit BACE-1 inhibition potential. This rule applies to molecules 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 as they all contain NH2+ groups attached to a carbon atom next to a double bond. Again, this rule should not be considered a strict requirement for BACE-1 inhibition but rather a possible indicator of potential inhibitory activity.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a fluorine atom (F) bonded to a carbon atom at the para position relative to another functional group may show some degree of BACE-1 inhibition potential. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, and 3 as they all contain F atoms connected to a carbon atom at the para position relative to another functional group. While this rule may provide some insight into the potential inhibitory activity of these molecules, it should again be used cautiously due to the complex nature of BACE-1 inhibition and the many factors involved.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the structure of a molecule may indicate its ability to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules 4 and 5 as they both have a C=O group attached to a five-membered ring. However, this rule does not apply to all molecules containing a C=O group because other factors such as the position and orientation of the C=O group also play a role in determining whether or not the molecule can inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 2: A positively charged nitrogen atom (NH+) in the structure of a molecule may indicate its ability to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules 6 and 7 as they both have NH+ groups attached to a six-membered ring. Again, this rule does not apply to all molecules containing an NH+ group because other factors such as the position and orientation of the NH+ group also play a role in determining whether or not the molecule can inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 3: The absence of a fluorine atom (F) in the structure of a molecule may indicate its inability to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules 8 and 9 as they both contain F atoms. Fluorine atoms are often used in drug design due to their unique chemical properties; however, their presence in certain positions within a molecule may hinder its ability to interact with target proteins like BACE-1.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in a molecule may indicate its ability to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules 5 and 6.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a guanidine group (-CH2NHC(=NH)NH2) may also have the potential to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules 7 and 8.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains both a sulfonamide group and a guanidine group, it may have a higher likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1. This rule applies to molecule 9.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could help in predicting whether a molecule can inhibit BACE-1 or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it can inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules S1, FC(C(=O)NC(Cc1cc2OCOc2cc1)C(O)C[NH2+]C1CC2(Oc3ncc(cc13)CC(C)(C)C)CCC2)C, Fc1ccc(cc1C#C)CC(NC(=O)COC)C(O)C[NH2+]C1CC2(Oc3ncc(cc13)CC(C)(C)C)CCC2, fc1ccc(cc1-c1cncnc1)[C@]1(N=C(N)N(C)C1=O)c1ccc(OC(F)(F)F)cc1, O(CCC)c1cc(ccc1)-c1cc(ccc1)C1CC1C1(N=C(N)N(C)C(=O)C1)C, s(=O)(=O)(N(C)c1cc(cc(c1)C(=O)NC(C(O)CC(C(=O)NC(C(C)C)C(=O)NCc1ccccc1)C)COCc1ccccc1)C(=O)NC(C)c1ccccc1)C, Fc1cc(cc(F)c1)CC(NC(=O)C)C(O)C[NH2+]C1(CCOC1)c1cc(-n2nccc2)ccc1, Oc1ccc(cc1)CC[NH3+], Clc1ccc(nc1)C(=O

================================

Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as -COOH or -CONH2 in its structure, then it can potentially inhibit BACE-1. This rule is based on the fact that these groups have been shown to interact with active sites of enzymes and inhibit their activity. The molecules containing these groups in their structures are labeled as "1" in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule has a cyclic structure with a nitrogen atom present in it, then it may not be able to inhibit BACE-1. This rule is based on the observation that most inhibitors of BACE-1 contain a heterocyclic ring system with a polar functional group attached to it. However, some exceptions to this rule exist where molecules without any heteroatoms but having a rigid conformation also show inhibitory activity against BACE-1. These molecules are labeled as "1" in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in its structure, then it cannot inhibit BACE-1. This rule is based on the fact that sulfonamides are known to act as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors which do not target BACE-1. Molecules containing sulfonamide groups are labeled as "0" in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a beta-secretase inhibitor group such as "-NHC(=O)R" or "-NR'R''C(=O)" in a compound increases its likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1. This rule applies to compounds 4 and 5.
Rule 2: Compounds containing a sulfonamide group such as "SO2NR" have been shown to possess BACE-1 inhibitory activity. This rule applies to compounds 6 and 7.
Rule 3: A compound with a benzenesulfonamide group such as "PhSO2NR" has also been reported to exhibit BACE-1 inhibition. This rule applies to compound 8.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the structure of a molecule may indicate its ability to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules FC1 and O=C(NC1CCCCC1)CCc1cc2cc(ccc2nc1N)-c1ccccc1C as they both have a carbonyl group present in their structures which may contribute to their inhibitory activity against BACE-1. However, this rule does not apply to all molecules containing a carbonyl group because some may not possess the necessary structural features required for inhibition.
Rule 2: A positively charged nitrogen atom (NH2+) in the structure of a molecule may also suggest its potential to inhibit BACE-1. Molecules s1cc(cc1C)C1(N=C(N)N(C)C1=O)c1cc(ccc1)-c1cncnc1 and S(=O)(=O)(N(C)c1cc2cc(c1)C(=O)NC(COC\C=C/CCN(C)C2=O)C(O)C[NH2+]Cc1cc(ccc1)C(C)C)C follow this rule as they contain NH2+ groups in their structures which may interact with negatively charged residues on the active site of BACE-1. Again, this rule should only be used as a preliminary indicator since other factors such as molecular size, shape, and hydrophobicity may also play a role in determining whether or not a molecule will inhibit BACE-1.
Rule 3: The absence of certain functional groups or atoms in the structure of a molecule may also affect its ability to inhibit BACE-1. For example, molecules Fc1ccc(cc1-c1cncnc1)[C@@]1(N=C(N)N(C)C1=O)c1ccc(OC(F)(F)F)cc1 and

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in a molecule may indicate that it can inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules S and T.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbamate group (-COOR) where R is an alkyl or aryl group, then it may not be able to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecule U.
Rule 3: A molecule containing a guanidine group (-NR2R') may have the potential to inhibit BACE-1. However, this rule should be used cautiously as there may be exceptions. This rule applies to molecule V.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in a molecule may indicate its ability to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules S and O.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a guanidine group (-C(NH2)=NR-) may also have the potential to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules P and Q.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains both a sulfonamide group and a guanidine group, it may have a higher likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1 compared to those containing only one of these groups. However, this rule should be used cautiously as there could be other factors affecting the inhibitory activity of the molecule.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a functional group such as -C(=O)N- or -CONH- in a molecule may indicate its ability to inhibit BACE-1. This is because these groups have been shown to interact with the active site of BACE-1 and block its activity.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a heterocyclic ring system such as thiophene or pyridine may also exhibit inhibitory activity against BACE-1. This is due to the fact that these rings can mimic the structure of natural substrates of BACE-1 and bind to its active site.
Rule 3: The absence of certain functional groups or structural features in a molecule may suggest that it does not possess any BACE-1 inhibitory activity. For example, molecules without a -C(=O)N- or -CONH- group do not seem to show significant inhibition towards BACE-1. Similarly, molecules lacking a heterocyclic ring system or other specific structural motifs are less likely to display inhibitory activity.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom in the molecule, then it can inhibit BACE-1. The presence of fluorine atoms can increase the lipophilicity and metabolic stability of molecules, which may enhance their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and interact with target proteins like BACE-1. However, this rule alone does not guarantee whether or not a molecule will actually inhibit BACE-1, as other factors such as molecular size, shape, and charge also play important roles.
Rule 2: If there is a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms in a five-membered ring structure, then it cannot inhibit BACE-1. This type of structural motif is commonly found in many drugs and pharmaceuticals, but it appears to be incompatible with inhibition of BACE-1. It is possible that the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom interferes with binding to the active site of BACE-1.
Rule 3: If there is a carbonyl group (C=O) present in the molecule, then it cannot inhibit BACE-1. Carbonyl groups are often involved in hydrogen bonding interactions, which can affect the conformation and reactivity of the molecule. It is possible that these interactions prevent the molecule from binding to the active site of BACE-1.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a fluorine atom on the benzene ring in compound 1 indicates that it can inhibit BACE-1. This may be due to the electronegativity of fluorine, which can affect the electronic structure and binding affinity of the molecule towards BACE-1. However, this rule should not be applied universally as other compounds without fluorines also show inhibitory activity against BACE-1.
Rule 2: The presence of a nitrile group in compound 4 suggests that it cannot inhibit BACE-1. This may be because the nitrile group is highly polar and can disrupt the hydrophobic interactions between the inhibitor and the enzyme active site. Therefore, the absence of such groups or their replacement by less polar functional groups may improve the potency of the inhibitors.
Rule 3: Compounds containing a benzimidazole moiety like compound 7 have been shown to exhibit potent BACE-1 inhibition. This may be attributed to the ability of the imidazole ring to form hydrogen bonds with the catalytic aspartic acid residues in the active site of BACE-1. Additionally, the presence of electron-withdrawing substituents like carbonyl groups on the phenyl ring can enhance the binding affinity of the inhibitor through additional electrostatic interactions.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a functional group such as -COOH or -CONH2 in a molecule may indicate its ability to inhibit BACE-1. This is because these groups can form hydrogen bonds with the active site of BACE-1 and block its activity. However, this rule alone does not guarantee inhibition since other factors such as molecular size and shape also play a role.
Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic rings such as phenyl or indole may have a higher likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1 due to their planar structure which can fit into the active site of BACE-1 better than non-aromatic molecules.
Rule 3: A molecule's hydrophobicity may affect its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the target site within the brain where BACE-1 is located. Therefore, hydrophobic molecules may have a greater chance of being effective inhibitors compared to hydrophilic ones.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a beta-secretase inhibitor group such as "[NH3+]" or "[NH2+]" in the structure of a molecule indicates that it can potentially inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules 4 and 5.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a functional group like "C=ONHC(=O)" or "C=ONHCOCN", it may also have inhibitory activity against BACE-1. This rule applies to molecule 9.
Rule 3: A molecule containing a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group may also exhibit inhibition towards BACE-1. This rule applies to molecule 8.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a carbonyl group present in the structure of the molecule and it is connected to a five or six membered ring containing at least one nitrogen atom, then the molecule has the potential to inhibit BACE-1. The presence of this functional group may form hydrogen bonds with the active site of BACE-1, which could lead to inhibition.
Example: OC(C(NC(=O)C1CC(CCC1)C(N(C(=O)CC)C)(C)C)Cc1ccccc1)C[NH2+]Cc1cc(ccc1)C(C)C 0
Rule 2: If there is a ferrocene group present in the structure of the molecule, then the molecule does not have the potential to inhibit BACE-1. Ferrocene is a stable organic compound that is not reactive enough to interact with enzymes like BACE-1.
Example: Fc1c2c(ccc1)C(N=C2N)(c1cc(ccc1)-c1cncnc1)c1cc(ncc1)C(F)(F)F 0
Rule 3: If there is a sulfonamide group present in the structure of the molecule, then the molecule has the potential to inhibit BACE-1. Sulfonamides are known to bind to enzymes through hydrogen bonding and other non-covalent interactions.
Example: S(=O)(=O)(N(c1cc(ccc1)C(=O)NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(O)C[NH2+]C(C(=O)NC1CCCCC1)C)c1cc(OC)ccc1)C 1

================================

Rule 1: If there is a chlorine atom present on the aromatic ring and no other functional group is attached to it, then the molecule will have the ability to inhibit BACE-1 enzyme. This rule applies to molecules 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 in the given dataset.
Rule 2: If there is a sulfonamide group present in the molecule, then it will not have the ability to inhibit BACE-1 enzyme. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 in the given dataset.
Rule 3: If there is a fluorine atom present on the aromatic ring and another functional group such as carbonyl or cyano group is also present, then the molecule may have the ability to inhibit BACE-1 enzyme. This rule applies to molecules 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 2

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the structure of a molecule may indicate its ability to inhibit BACE-1. This rule is based on the fact that many known inhibitors of BACE-1 contain a carbonyl group as part of their functional groups. However, this rule alone does not guarantee inhibition of BACE-1 since other factors such as molecular size and shape also play important roles.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a heterocyclic ring system such as thiophene or pyridine may have a higher likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1 compared to molecules without these rings. These rings may provide additional interactions with the active site of BACE-1 through hydrogen bonding or π-π stacking.
Rule 3: A positively charged nitrogen atom in the structure of a molecule may increase its affinity for binding to BACE-1 due to electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged aspartate residues in the enzyme's active site. Therefore, molecules containing basic amines or ammonium ions may have a greater chance of being able to inhibit BACE-1 than neutral compounds.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in a molecule may indicate that it can inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules S and O4.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a guanidine group (-C(=NH2)NR2R3) or a urea group (-CONHR), it may not be able to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules F and G5.
Rule 3: A molecule containing a carbamate group (-OCONHR) may have some potential to inhibit BACE-1. However, this rule should be used cautiously as there may be exceptions. This rule applies to molecules H6 and I7.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a functional group such as an amide or an amine in the structure of a molecule may indicate its ability to inhibit BACE-1. This is because these groups have been shown to interact with the active site of BACE-1 and block its activity.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a heterocyclic ring system such as thiophene or pyridine may also exhibit inhibitory activity against BACE-1. These rings may mimic the structure of natural substrates of BACE-1 and bind to its active site.
Rule 3: The length and flexibility of the carbon chain connecting the functional group or heterocycle to the rest of the molecule may also affect its ability to inhibit BACE-1. Longer chains may make it difficult for the molecule to fit into the active site of BACE-1, while more rigid structures may prevent it from adopting the correct conformation required for binding.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the structure of a molecule may indicate its ability to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules such as OC(C(NC(=O)c1cc(Nc2ccccc2)ccc1)Cc1ccccc1)C[NH2+]C(C(=O)NC1CCCCC1)C and O=C1N(C)C(=NC(C1)(CCc1cc(ccc1)-c1ccccc1)C)N.
Rule 2: The absence of a carbonyl group but the presence of other functional groups like amines or amides may also suggest the potential of a molecule to inhibit BACE-1. For example, Fc1cc(cc(F)c1)CC(NC(=O)C)C(O)C[NH2+]C1(CCCCC1)c1cc(ccc1)-c1occc1 and Clc1cc(-c2cc3c(Oc4c(cc(OC)cc4)[C@@]34N=C(OC4)N)cc2)c(F)cc1 follow this rule.
Rule 3: The position and orientation of functional groups in a molecule play a crucial role in determining its inhibitory activity against BACE-1. For instance, S(=O)(=O)(N(c1cc(ncc1)C(=O)NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(O)C[NH2+]Cc1cc(ccc1)C(F)(F)F)c1ccccc1)C has a sulfonyl group attached to a benzene ring, which may hinder its interaction with BACE-1 active site due to steric hindrance. On the contrary, FC(F)Oc1ccc(cc1C)[C@@]

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a beta-secretase inhibitor group such as "-NHCHRCOOH" or "-CONHR" in the structure of a molecule indicates that it can potentially inhibit BACE-1 enzyme activity and thus has the potential to treat Alzheimer's disease.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a sulfonamide group "-SO2NR" may not have inhibitory effects on BACE-1 but could still interact with other biological targets related to AD pathology. Therefore, it should be further evaluated for its therapeutic potential against AD.
Rule 3: Molecules without any functional groups commonly found in known BACE-1 inhibitors, such as those mentioned above, may not exhibit significant inhibition towards this target protein. However, they might still possess some other mechanisms of action relevant to treating AD, which need to be explored through additional experiments.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could help in predicting whether a molecule can inhibit BACE-1 or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as -COOH, -CONH2, or -SO3H, then it has a high probability of inhibiting BACE-1. This rule is supported by the fact that these groups have been previously reported to interact with active sites of BACE-1 and inhibit its activity. For example, compounds containing the -COOH group, such as S1(=O)(=O)NN(C)C(=O)SC1(=O)c1ccc(Br)cc1 (label 1) and Clc1cc(Cl)ccc1C(=O)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 (label 0), show contrasting inhibitory activities against BACE-1.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a heterocyclic ring system such as thiophene, pyridine, or pyrimidine, then it also has a high probability of inhibiting BACE-1. This rule is supported by the fact that these rings have been shown to interact with active sites of BACE-1 and inhibit its activity. For example, compound Fc1ccc(cc1C#CC)[C@]1(N=C(N)N(C)C1=O)c1ccc(OC(F)F)cc1 (label 1) contains a thiophene ring and shows strong inhibition of BACE-1, while compound n1cc(ccc1)-c1cc(ccc1)C1(N=C(C)C(=N1)N)c1ccccc1 (label 0) does not contain any heterocycle but still exhibits weak inhibition of BACE-1.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a long carbon chain attached to a polar functional group, such as -OH or -NH2, then it may not necessarily inhibit BACE-1. However, if this

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in a molecule increases its likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules S(CCC([NH3+])(Cc1ccccc1)CO)c1cc(cc(N(S(=O)(=O)C)C)c1)C(=O)NC(C)c1ccc(F)cc1 and FC1(F)COC(=NC1(C)c1cc(NC(=O)c2ncc(OC(F)(F)C(F)F)cc2)ccc1F)N from the given dataset.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a guanidine group (-C(NH2)=NNHC(NH2)=NH-) has a higher probability of being able to inhibit BACE-1 compared to one without it. This rule applies to molecules O=C(N1CCC(CC1)c1ccccc1)C1C[NH2+]CC1c1ccccc1 and Fc1ncccc1-c1cc(ccc1)[C@]1([NH+]=C(N2CC(N=C12)(C)C)N)c1ccc(OC(F)(F)F)cc1 from the given dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains both a sulfonamide group and a guanidine group, it is more likely to have inhibitory activity against BACE-1 than either one alone. This rule applies to molecule S(c1cc(cc(c1)C(=O)NC(Cc1cc(F)cc(F)c1)C(O)C[NH2+]Cc1cc(OC)ccc1)C(=O)N(CCC)CCC)c1ccccc1 from the given dataset.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in a molecule may indicate its ability to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules S and T.
Rule 2: A molecule containing both a carbamate group (-CONHR-) and a guanidine group (-NR'R''NHC(=NH)NH-) may have the potential to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecule U.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) attached to a benzene ring, it may not be able to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecule V.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the structure of a molecule may indicate its ability to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules such as Fc1ncccc1-c1cc(ccc1)C1(N=C(N)N(C)C1=O)c1ccncc1 and O1c2ncc(cc2C([NH2+]CC(O)C(NC(=O)COC)Cc2cc(ccc2)C#CC)CC12CCC2)CC(C)(C)C.
Rule 2: Molecules containing a sulfonyl group (SO2) or a carbamate group (-O-CO-NR2R3) may not be able to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules such as S(=O)(=O)(Cc1cc(ccc1)C(=O)NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(O)C[NH2+]C(C(=O)NC1CCCCC1)C)c1ccccc1 and FC(F)(F)c1cc(ccc1)-c1cc(ccc1)C1(N=C(N)N(C)C1=O)c1ccncc1.
Rule 3: A molecule's ability to inhibit BACE-1 may depend on whether it contains a positively charged nitrogen atom within a certain distance from the functional group responsible for inhibiting BACE-1. For example, molecules like Clc1cc(cc(F)c1)CC(NC(=O)C(N1CCC(C(C)C)C1=O)CCc1ccccc1)C(O)C1[NH2+]CC(OCCC)C1 and fc1cc(cc(f)c1)

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom in the structure of a molecule increases its likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules FC(F)(F)c1cc(ccc1)C[NH2+]CC(O)C(NC(=O)c1cc(N2CCCC2=O)c2n(cc(c2c1)CC)C)Cc1ccccc1 and Brc1cc2n(ccc2cc1)CC(=O)NC(=[NH2+])NCc1cc(Cl)c(NC(=O)C)c(Cl)c1.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group attached to a carbon atom that is part of a five-membered ring, it may not be able to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to S(=O)(=O)(N(c1cc(cc(c1)C(=O)N[C@H]([C@@H](O)C[NH2+]Cc1cc(OC)ccc1)Cc1cc(F)cc(F)c1)C(=O)C)c1ccccc1)C.
Rule 3: A molecule containing a sulfonamide group may not be able to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to Fc1cc(cc(F)c1)CC(NC(=O)C(N1CCC(CCCC)C1=O)C)C(O)C1[NH2+]Cc2c(C1)cccc2.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a fluorine atom present on the benzene ring and the nitrogen atom is connected to the carbon atom next to the benzene ring through a single bond, then the molecule can inhibit BACE-1. The presence of fluorine atoms increases the polarity of the molecule which may enhance its ability to interact with the active site of BACE-1.
Rule 2: If there is a carbonyl group attached to the cyclopentane ring and the nitrogen atom is connected to one of the carbon atoms in the ring through a double bond, then the molecule can inhibit BACE-1. This structure may mimic the transition state of the substrate during catalysis by BACE-1.
Rule 3: If there is a sulfonamide group present in the molecule and the nitrogen atom is connected to the sulfur atom through a double bond, then the molecule cannot inhibit BACE-1. Sulfonamides are known to act as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and do not have any BACE-1 inhibitory activity.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a beta-secretase inhibitor group such as a sulfonamide or a hydroxymethylketone in a compound increases its likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1. This rule applies to compounds S and T.
Rule 2: A compound containing a carbamate functional group may not be able to inhibit BACE-1 due to its instability under physiological conditions. This rule applies to compound U.
Rule 3: Compounds containing a tertiary amine or a guanidine group have a higher probability of being able to inhibit BACE-1 compared to those containing primary or secondary amines. This rule applies to compounds V and W.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the structure of a molecule may indicate its ability to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules S and V.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a positively charged nitrogen atom (NH3+ or NR3+), it may not be able to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z, AA, AB, AC, AD, AE, AF, AG, AH, AI, AJ, AK, AL, AM, AN, AO, AP, AQ, AR, AS, AT, AU, AV, AW, AX, AZ, BA, BB, BC, BD, BE, BF, BG, BH, BI, BJ, BK, BL, BM, BN, BO, BP, BQ, BR, BS, BT, BU, BV, BW, BX, BY, BZ, CA, CB, CC, CD, CE, CF, CG, CH, CI, CJ, CK, CL, CM, CN, CO, CP, CQ, CR, CS, CT, CU, CV, CW, CX, CY, CZ, DA, DB, DC, DD, DE, DF, DG, DH, DI, DJ, DK, DL, DM, DN, DO, DP, DQ, DR, DS, DT, DU, DV, DW, DX, DY, DZ, EA, EB, EC, ED, EE, EF, EG, EH, EI, EJ, EL, EM, EN, EO, EP, EQ, ER, ES, ET, EU, EV, EW, EX, EZ, FA, FB, FC, FD, FE, FF, FG, FH, FI, FJ, FK, FL, FM, FN, FO, FP, FQ, FR, FS, FT, FU, FV, FW, FX, FY, FZ,

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a positively charged functional group such as ammonium or amine in the structure of a molecule increases its likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules 1 and 5.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a carbonyl group conjugated with an alkene or alkyne has a higher probability of being able to inhibit BACE-1 compared to one without conjugation. This rule applies to molecules 6 and 7.
Rule 3: Molecules with a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group have a lower chance of inhibiting BACE-1 than those without this substitution. This rule applies to molecules 8 and 9.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a beta-secretase inhibitor group such as a carbamate or urea in a compound increases its likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1. This rule applies to compounds 4 and 5.
Rule 2: Compounds containing a heterocyclic ring system such as thiophene or furan have a higher probability of being able to inhibit BACE-1 compared to those without them. This rule applies to compounds 6 and 7.
Rule 3: A positively charged nitrogen atom in a compound may increase its ability to bind to BACE-1 due to electrostatic interactions. However, this rule should be used cautiously since it does not always hold true. For example, compound 8 contains a positively charged nitrogen but has no inhibitory activity against BACE-1.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a beta-secretase inhibitor group such as N=C-N or C=ONHC in a compound indicates that it may have inhibitory activity against BACE-1.
Rule 2: A negatively charged functional group such as SO3- or COO- attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a nitrogen atom in a compound suggests that it has potential for inhibiting BACE-1.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a heterocyclic ring system with at least one nitrogen atom and a carbonyl group connected by a single bond, then it could potentially act as a BACE-1 inhibitor.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a beta-secretase inhibitor group such as "FC1(F)COC(=NC1(C)c1cc(NC(=O)c2ncc(OCC#C)nc2)ccc1F)N" in a compound indicates that it has the potential to inhibit BACE-1 activity and may have therapeutic benefits for Alzheimer's disease patients.
Rule 2: A compound containing a negatively charged functional group like "O=C(N[C@H]([C@@H](O)C[C@H](C(=O)NCCCC)C)Cc1ccccc1)[C@H]1C[C@H](CCC1)C(NC(=O)C)(C)C" may not be able to cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore may not be effective in treating neurological disorders.
Rule 3: A compound having a sulfonamide group such as "S1CC(N=C1N)(C)c1cc(NC(=O)c2ncccc2)ccc1" may not be suitable for use as a drug due to its potential toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a sulfonamide group present in the molecule, then it can inhibit BACE-1. The presence of this functional group is indicated by the S(=O)2R notation in the SMILES string. This rule applies to molecules 4 and 5.
Rule 2: If there is a guanidine or amidine group present in the molecule, then it can inhibit BACE-1. These groups are represented as R2NHR'NR'' and R2NRR' respectively in the SMILES strings. This rule applies to molecules 6 and 7.
Rule 3: If there is a carbonyl group present next to a double bond in the molecule, then it can inhibit BACE-1. This functional group is denoted as C=C(OR) in the SMILES strings. This rule applies to molecules 8 and 9.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a sulfonamide group present in the molecule, then it can inhibit BACE-1. The presence of this functional group is indicated by the S(=O)(=O)N(*) fragment in the SMILES notation. This rule applies to molecules 4 and 5.
Rule 2: If there is a carbonyl group present in the molecule, then it may or may not inhibit BACE-1. However, if the carbon atom attached to the oxygen atom also has two hydrogen atoms, as in C(=O)CH2R', where R' is any substituent, then it cannot inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules 6 and 7.
Rule 3: If there is a fluorine atom present on one of the aromatic rings, then it can increase the likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules 8 and 9.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) in the structure of a molecule may indicate its ability to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules numbered 1 and 46.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a benzimidazole ring, it may not be able to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules numbered 57 and 89.
Rule 3: A molecule containing a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) may not be able to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules numbered 64 and 96.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a carbonyl group present in the structure of the molecule and it is connected to a five or six membered ring containing at least one nitrogen atom, then it can potentially inhibit BACE-1. The presence of this functional group and structural feature indicates that the molecule may interact with the active site of BACE-1 through hydrogen bonding and other non-covalent interactions.
Example molecules that follow Rule 1:
- Clc1cc(ccc1OC)C1(N=C(N)N(C)C1=O)c1cc(ccc1)-c1cccnc1 (label 1)
- O(C)c1ccc(cc1C)C1(N=C(N)N(C)C1=O)c1cc(ccc1)-c1cccnc1 (label 0)
Rule 2: If there is a sulfonamide group present in the structure of the molecule, then it cannot inhibit BACE-1. This functional group is known to have a high binding affinity for zinc ions, which are essential for the catalytic activity of many enzymes including BACE-1. Therefore, the presence of a sulfonamide group likely disrupts the interaction between the inhibitor and the enzyme.
Example molecules that follow Rule 2:
- Fc1nn(C)c2nccc(C)c2n1 (label 0)
- Brc1cc(ccc1)C12N=C(Nc3ccccc3Br)ON1C2 (label 0)
Rule 3: If there is a carbamate group present in the structure of the molecule, then it can potentially inhibit BACE-1. Carbamates are known to be good inhibitors of proteases due to their ability to form stable tetrahedral intermediates during catalysis. However, they should only be considered as potential inhibitors when used in combination with other structural features that promote specific interactions with the target protein.
Example molecules that follow Rule 3:

================================

Rule 1: If there is a positively charged nitrogen atom in the structure of the molecule, then it can potentially inhibit BACE-1. The presence of this functional group may help in binding to the active site of BACE-1. However, not all molecules containing this group will necessarily inhibit BACE-1.
Example: s1cc(nc1C1([NH2+]CC(O)C(NC(=O)C)Cc2cc(F)cc(F)c2)CC1)CC(C)(C)C 0
Rule 2: If there is a fluorine atom present on a cycloalkane ring in the structure of the molecule, then it can potentially inhibit BACE-1. Fluorine atoms have high electronegativity and can affect the electronic distribution of the molecule, which may lead to better interaction with the active site of BACE-1.
Example: Fc1cc(cc(F)c1)CC(NC(=O)C(N1CCC(COC)C1=O)CCc1ccccc1)C(O)C[NH2+]Cc1cc(OC)ccc1 1
Rule 3: If there is a carbonyl group present next to a double bond in the structure of the molecule, then it can potentially inhibit BACE-1. This functional group may form hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions with the active site of BACE-1.
Example: S1(=O)(=O)N(c2cc(cc3c2n(cc3CC)CC1)C(=O)NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(O)C[NH2+]C1CCOCC1)C 1

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in a molecule may indicate its ability to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules S1 and Fc1cc(cc(F)c1)CC(NC(=O)C)C(O)C[NH2+]C1(CCC(CC1)CCO)c1cc(ccc1)C(C)(C)C.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a carbamate group (-CONH-) may also have the potential to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules O1c2ncc(cc2C([NH2+]CC(O)C(NC(=O)C)Cc2ccccc2)CC12CCC2)CC(C)C and FC(F)Oc1ccc(cc1)[C@@]1(N=C(N)N(C)C1=O)c1cc(ccc1)\C=C\CCCOC.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains both a sulfonamide group and a carbamate group, it has a higher likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1. This rule applies to molecule Clc1cc(ccc1)-c1cc(ccc1)C1(OCCC(=N1)N)C.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in a molecule may indicate that it can inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules S and O.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a guanidine group (-C(=NH2)NR2R3) or a urea group (-CONHR), it may not be able to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules N and P.
Rule 3: A molecule containing a ferrocene group (-Fe(C5H4)2) may not be able to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules Q and R.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a fluorine atom present in the structure of the molecule and it is bonded to two carbon atoms, then the molecule can inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.
Rule 2: If there is a nitrogen atom present in the structure of the molecule and it is bonded to three carbon atoms, then the molecule cannot inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules 2 and 3.
Rule 3: If there is a sulfonamide group present in the structure of the molecule, then the molecule can inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules 17 and 18.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in a molecule indicates that it may be able to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules 4 and 5.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a guanidine group (-C(NH2)=NR2), it may not be able to inhibit BACE-1. This rule applies to molecules 6 and 7.
Rule 3: A molecule containing a carbamate group (-OC(=O)NR2R3) may or may not be able to inhibit BACE-1 depending on its structure. Molecules 8 and 9 do not follow this rule as they contain a urea group instead of a carbamate group but still have different structures.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a carbonyl group (C=O) present in the structure of the molecule and it is conjugated with another double bond or triple bond, then it has a high probability of inhibiting BACE-1. The presence of electronegative atoms like F, Cl, O, N near the C=O group may also enhance its ability to bind to the active site of BACE-1.
Example molecules that follow this rule:
O=C(NCC1CCCCC1)C(Cc1cc2cc(ccc2nc1N)-c1ccccc1C)CC 1; FC(F)(F)c1cc(ccc1)-c1cc(ccc1)C1(N=C(N)N(C)C1=O)c1ccncc1 0; FCCCCC#Cc1cc(ccc1)[C@]1(N=C(N)N(C)C1=O)c1ccc(OC(F)F)cc1 1; S1(=O)(=O)CC(Cc2cc(OCCC)c(N)cc2)C(O)C([NH2+]Cc2cc(ccc2)C(C)(C)C)C1 1; Fc1cc(cc(F)c1)CC(NC(=O)C)C(O)C[NH2+]C1(CCCCC1)c1cc(N2CCOCC2=O)ccc1 0; fc1cc(cc(f)c1) CC( NC(=O) c2 ncc( cc2) C#N) C(O) COC[ NH2+]C1 CCCC1) c1 cc(ccc1) C(C)(C)C 0; FC(F)(F) Oc1ccc(cc1)[C@@]1(N=C(N)N(C)C1=O)c1ccccc1 0; Fc1ccc(NC(

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a beta-secretase inhibitor group such as "-C(=O)NN" or "-CONHNHC(=O)" in a compound increases its likelihood of inhibiting BACE-1. This rule applies to compounds 5 and 6.
Rule 2: Compounds containing electronegative atoms like fluorine tend to have higher lipophilicity than their non-fluorinated counterparts. Therefore, they may have better permeability across cell membranes and could potentially be more effective inhibitors of BACE-1. This rule applies to compounds 7 and 8.
Rule 3: A compound's ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a crucial role in determining whether it can effectively inhibit BACE-1 in the brain. Therefore, compounds with high BBB penetration potential should be considered for further evaluation as BACE-1 inhibitors. This rule applies to all compounds except number 9 since it does not contain any functional groups that enhance membrane permeability.
