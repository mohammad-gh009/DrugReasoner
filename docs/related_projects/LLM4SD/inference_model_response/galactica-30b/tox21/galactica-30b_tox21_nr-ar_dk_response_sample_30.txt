Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a bromine atom bonded to a carbon atom through two single bonds, then it may have potential toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for the first four molecules in the dataset. This rule suggests that the presence of a bromine atom may increase the likelihood of toxicity. However, this rule alone cannot accurately predict all cases of toxicity since there are many other factors that can contribute to toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) connected to another carbon atom through a double bond or triple bond, then it may have potential toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for the fifth molecule in the dataset. This rule suggests that the presence of a carbonyl group conjugated with a double or triple bond may increase the likelihood of toxicity. Again, however, this rule alone cannot accurately predict all cases of toxicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2) attached to a benzene ring, then it may have potential toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for the sixth molecule in the dataset. This rule suggests that the presence of a nitro group attached to a benzene ring may increase the likelihood of toxicity. Once again, however, this rule alone cannot accurately predict all cases of toxicity.

Based on this small dataset, here are three possible rules for predicting if a molecule has toxic activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) or a carboxylic acid group (COOH), then it may have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 6

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for those molecules. This rule is based on the fact that these functional groups are known to be associated with toxicity in many compounds.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-CH=CH-), then it may also have potential toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for one such molecule in the dataset. This rule is based on the fact that this type of conjugation can increase the reactivity of the compound and make it more susceptible to attack by other molecules.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) attached to a carbon atom, then it may also have potential toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for several such molecules in the dataset. This rule is based on the fact that halogens are often associated with toxicity due to their ability to react with other molecules and disrupt normal biological processes.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential toxic effects as these groups are known to be associated with toxicity. Therefore, molecules containing either of these groups should be labeled as having potential toxic effects (label 1).
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), then it may also have potential toxic effects due to their ability to disrupt biological systems. Therefore, molecules containing halogens should also be labeled as having potential toxic effects (label 1).
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5) or a naphthalene ring (C10H8), then it may also have potential toxic effects because these rings are commonly found in many toxic compounds. Therefore, molecules containing these rings should also be labeled as having potential toxic effects (label 1).

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three possible rules for predicting if a molecule has toxic activity towards the androgen receptor in NR signalling pathways based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, it tends to have higher probability of being toxic than molecules without halogens. This rule can be applied to the first four SMILES strings where the presence of Cl or Br atoms leads to a label of 1.
Rule 2: Molecules containing functional groups like carbonyl (C=O), nitro (NO2), or sulfonyl (SO2) tend to have lower probabilities of being toxic compared to those without these groups. This rule can be applied to the last two SMILES strings where the absence of C=O group leads to a label of 1.
Rule 3: The length of the carbon chain also plays a role in determining the toxicity of a molecule. Shorter chains may lead to more toxic compounds while longer ones may result in less toxic compounds. For example, the fifth SMILES string has a shorter chain leading to a label of 1 whereas the twelfth SMILES string has a longer chain resulting in a label of 0.

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-), then it may also have potential toxic effects due to the reactivity of this functional group. Therefore, such molecules should also be labeled as having potential toxic effects (label 1).
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it may have potential toxic effects as this functional group is commonly found in pesticides and other chemicals that are known to be toxic. Therefore, such molecules should also be labeled as having potential toxic effects (label 1).
