Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards PPAR receptors based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This rule applies to molecules 1, 8, 9, and 10.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-), then it is also likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This rule applies to molecules 2, 3, and 4.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a bromine atom (Br) bonded to two carbon atoms, as well as another Br atom attached to one of those carbons, then it is highly likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This rule applies only to molecule 7.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided by this dataset, and should be further validated using larger datasets before being applied to real-world scenarios.

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards PPAR receptors based on its structure and properties:
1. If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as chlorine (-Cl), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors (label 1). This is because these functional groups are known to interact with PPAR receptors and affect their function.
2. If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors (label 0). Sulfonyl groups are often found in drugs that target other proteins and do not interfere with PPAR receptors.
3. If the molecule contains a long chain of carbon atoms without any functional groups, then it is also unlikely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors (label 0). These molecules may simply not bind well to PPAR receptors due to their size and shape.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards PPAR receptors based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (represented by the functional group CCC(=O)O or C=O), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This rule applies to molecules 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine (represented by Cl or Br), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This rule applies to molecules 2, 3, 4, and 22.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (represented by O=S(=O)(O-)), then it may have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This rule applies to molecule 23.
It's important to note that these rules are based on a limited set of data and should be used cautiously when predicting the toxicity of new molecules. Further research and testing would be needed to validate their accuracy and reliability.

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards PPAR receptors based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a bromine atom, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors (label 1). This rule applies only to one molecule in the dataset, which has a bromine atom and a label of 1. However, since there are no other molecules in the dataset with similar structures or properties, we cannot make any strong conclusions about this rule's accuracy or generalizability.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is also likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors (label 1). This rule applies to two molecules in the dataset, both of which have labels of 1. Nitro groups are known to be highly reactive and can interact with biological systems in various ways, so it is not surprising that they might affect PPAR receptors. Again, however, this rule should be considered tentative until more data becomes available.
Rule 3: If the molecule does not contain either a bromine atom nor a nitro group but has a high number of rotatable bonds (>5), then it may not have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors (label 0). This rule applies to four molecules in the dataset, all of which have low numbers of rotatable bonds (<5) and labels of 0. Rotatable bonds allow for flexibility in molecular structure, which can impact how a molecule interacts with biological

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards PPAR receptors based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) or a carboxylic acid group (COOH), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This rule applies to molecules like CC(C)CCOC(=O)C=Cc1ccccc1, CC(=O)OCc1ccccc1, Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, CNC(=O)Oc1c(C(C)(C)C)cc(C)cc1C(C)(C)C, O=C1NC(=O)[C@@]2(CCOc3ccc(F)cc32)N1, NCCN1CCOCC1, CCCc1c(OCCCOc2ccc(OCC(=O)O)cc2)ccc(C(C)=O)c1O, CNC(=O)NNc1ccccc1, NC(=O)CNNc1ccccc1, CCOC(=O)COc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, CCN(CC)CSSCC(=O)NS(=O)(=O)NSC(=O)(=O)NCC, CCSCCC(CC)COC(=O)COc1ccc(Cl)cc1

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards PPAR receptors based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This is because these functional groups are known to interact with PPAR receptors and cause adverse effects. For example, the compound CCCn1cc[n+](C)c1C contains a cyano group and has a label of 0.0, which indicates no toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. On the other hand, the compound C[N+](C)(C)Cc1ccccc1 also contains a cyano group but has a label of 1.0, indicating toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. Therefore, while the presence of a cyano group may indicate potential toxicity, it is not a definitive predictor by itself.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), then it is less likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This is because halogens are often used to modify the physical and chemical properties of molecules without significantly altering their biological activity. For instance, the compounds COOP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl and CNCc1cc(F)ccc1Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 both contain

Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine), it may have toxic activity due to its ability to disrupt protein-ligand interactions within biological systems. This rule applies to molecules such as c1ccc2[nH]cnc2c1, CCCP(=S)(OCC)SCSc1cc(Cl)ccc1Cl, and Oc1ccc(-c2ccccc2)c(Cl)c1.

Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), such as in CCOC(=O)OCS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(I)cc1, then it may have toxic activity due to its ability to bind to proteins and disrupt their function. However, this rule should be used cautiously since there may be other factors involved in determining toxicity.

The molecules containing such groups in the provided dataset all have labels of 1, indicating their ability to bind to PPAR receptors and cause toxicity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-CH=CH-), then it may also have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This is because such structures are similar to natural ligands of PPAR receptors, which contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) conjugated with an alkene group. Therefore, they may mimic the action of natural ligands and activate PPAR receptors, leading to adverse effects. However, this rule should be used cautiously as it is based on limited data and may not apply to all cases.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may not have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This is because sulfonamides are commonly used as antibiotics and do not typically interact with PPAR receptors. None of the molecules containing sulfonamide groups in the provided dataset had toxic activity towards PPAR receptors.
