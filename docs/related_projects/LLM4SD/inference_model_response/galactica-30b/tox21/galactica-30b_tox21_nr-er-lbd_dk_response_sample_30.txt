Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. The two molecules containing this functional group in the dataset both have a label of 0.0, indicating no observed toxicity. However, further research would need to be done to confirm these findings.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. One molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has a label of 0.0, while another does not contain it but still has a label of 0.0. Further analysis would need to be conducted to determine if there is any correlation between the presence of a nitro group and toxicity within the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, it may have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. Two molecules in the dataset contain this functional group and both have a label of 0.0, suggesting possible toxicity. Again, more research would need to be performed to confirm these findings.

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a bromine atom, then it is more likely to have toxic effects compared to molecules without bromine atoms. This rule is supported by the fact that many known toxic compounds contain halogen atoms such as bromine or chlorine. Therefore, we can assume that any compound containing bromine may potentially exhibit some level of toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is highly likely to have toxic effects. Nitro groups are often associated with mutagenicity and carcinogenicity due to their ability to form reactive oxygen species when exposed to certain conditions.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, then it is also likely to have toxic effects. Conjugated systems can increase the reactivity of a molecule and make it more susceptible to oxidation or other types of chemical reactions. These changes can lead to negative impacts on biological systems and potentially result in toxic effects.
