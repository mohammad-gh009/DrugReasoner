Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a bromine atom connected to two carbon atoms through a double bond, then it has toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to the first molecule in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it does not have toxic activity (label 0). This rule applies to the third molecule in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a benzene ring, then it has toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to the eleventh molecule in the dataset.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic activity and should receive a label of 1. This rule applies to molecules 4, 7, 8, 9, 15, and 16.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it is also likely to have toxic activity and should receive a label of 1. This rule applies to molecules 11, 12, and 13.
Rule 3: If the molecule does not contain any of these groups but still has a high probability of being toxic based on its structure, then it may need further investigation before assigning a label. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, and 14.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it is more likely to have toxic effects than molecules without halogens. This rule is supported by the fact that many environmental pollutants contain halogen atoms and are known to be harmful to living organisms.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom bonded to two nitrogen atoms, then it is less likely to have toxic effects compared to other types of molecules. This rule is based on the observation that this type of molecular structure is commonly found in natural compounds and may not pose a significant risk for human health.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, then it is more likely to have toxic effects compared to molecules without a benzene ring. This rule is supported by the fact that many chemicals that are known to be harmful to humans and the environment contain aromatic rings.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a silicon atom and a carbonyl group (C=O), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. The first example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains both a silicon atom and a carbonyl group. However, note that this rule should only be considered as a preliminary observation based on limited data and further research would be needed to confirm its validity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms and no other heteroatoms, then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This is because the second example in the dataset violates this rule by containing a nitrogen atom connected to four carbon atoms instead of just two. Again, more data would be required to validate this rule conclusively.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom and a double bond between two oxygen atoms, then it may have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. The last example in the dataset satisfies this rule but again, additional data would be necessary to establish its reliability.

================================

Based on these data points and their associated labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict whether a given molecule will have toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as fluorine or chlorine, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and a chlorine atom (Cl), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway (label 1). This rule applies to the first molecule in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a thioketone group (-C=S) and a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it is also likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway (label 1). This rule applies to the second molecule in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or an iodo group (-I), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway (label 0). This rule applies to the last two molecules in the dataset.
It's important to note that these rules are based on a limited amount of data and may not apply to all types of molecules. It's always best to consult with experts in the field for more accurate predictions.

================================

Based on this dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential for causing adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a bromine atom or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a bromine atom, it is likely to have toxic activity as indicated by the presence of molecules like BrCCBr and O=S(O)CO[Na] which have label 1. However, this rule may not always hold true since there are also some molecules without bromine atoms that have toxic activity such as Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2cccnc12. Therefore, other factors such as the type of functional groups present in the molecule should also be considered when predicting toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is unlikely to have toxic activity as indicated by the absence of any molecules containing a nitro group with label 1. This rule may not always hold true either because there are some molecules without nitro groups that have toxic activity such as Nc1ccn([C@H]2CC[C@@H](CO)O2)c(=O)n1. Therefore, other factors such as the position and orientation of the nitro group in the molecule should also be taken into account while predicting toxicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (>C=O), it is more likely to have toxic activity as indicated by the presence of several molecules containing a carbonyl group with label 1 such as CC(C)OC(=O)c1ccccc1, C=CC

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a bromine atom and no other halogen atoms, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 56, 78, and 90.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) or a thiocarbonyl group (C=S), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 4

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it is likely to have toxic activity and should receive a label of 1. This rule applies to molecules 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it is likely to have toxic effects towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules like Cl[C@H]1OCCO[C@@H]1Cl, COc1cc(C=O)ccc1O, Cc1ccccc1NC(=N)NC(=N)N, O=C(O)CN(CC(=O)O)CC(=O)O, etc.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have toxic effects towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules like Nc1nc2c(Cl)cccc2s1, c1ccc(OCC2CO2)cc1, CC(COC(C)(C)C)OCCCO, CCC(=O)Oc1ccc2c(c1)CC[C@@H]1[C@@H]2CC[C@]2(C)[C@@H](OC(=O)CC)CC[C@@H]12, etc.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) followed by two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom, i.e., -C=O

================================

Based on these data points and their corresponding labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule will have toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have toxic effects as indicated by the first SMILES string labeled as 0. However, this rule alone cannot accurately determine if a molecule has toxic effects since there are many other factors involved.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), it may also have toxic effects as indicated by the sixth SMILES string labeled as 0. Again, this rule alone cannot accurately determine if a molecule has toxic effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a benzofuran ring system, it may have toxic effects as indicated by the twelfth SMILES string labeled as 1. This rule is more specific than Rules 1 and 2 but still does not provide complete accuracy due to the complexity of predicting toxic effects.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom and a benzene ring connected by a single bond, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This is because chlorinated benzenes are known to be potent agonists for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. The two molecules with label 1 in the dataset contain such a structure.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group and a carbon-carbon double bond separated by one or more atoms, then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This is because alkenes do not activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. The four molecules with label 0 in the dataset contain such a structure.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom and a carbon-carbon triple bond, then it is also unlikely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This is because alkynes do not activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor either. However, note that these rules are based on a limited set of examples and may need to be refined as more data becomes available.

================================

Based on this dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom and no other halogen atoms, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules such as CCl4 or ClCH2COOH.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is highly likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules such as NC(=O)N=NC(N)=O or COc1cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccc1N.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) but no other functional groups, then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules such as CCO or CC(C)COC(=O)C=Cc1ccccc1.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a benzene ring or a similar aromatic system, then it is more likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules like OCCc1ccccc1, COC(C)OC, CC[N+]1(C)CCCC1.O=S(=O)([O-])C(F)(F)F, C=C1/C(=C\C=C2/CCC[C@@]3(C)[C@H]2CC[C@@H]3[C@H](C)/C=C/[C@@H](O)C2CC2)C[C@@H](O)C[C@@H]1O, CCC(=O)[O-])[C@H]1CC[C@H]2[C@@H]3CC[C@@H]4C[C@H](O)CC[C@]4(C)[C@H]3C[C@H](O)[C@@]21C, CN(C)c1ccc(N=NS(=O)(=O)[O-])

================================

Rule 1: The presence of halogen atoms such as chlorine or bromine may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects due to their ability to form covalent bonds with other molecules and disrupt normal biological processes. Therefore, compounds containing these elements should be labeled as toxic.
Rule 2: Compounds containing functional groups such as carbonyls (C=O), nitro groups (NO2), or sulfoxides (SO) may also have increased potential for toxicity. These groups can interact with proteins and enzymes in the body, leading to adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with complex ring structures or multiple conjugated double bonds may also exhibit higher levels of toxicity due to their ability to intercalate into DNA and interfere with replication or transcription.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a bromine atom and no other halogen atoms, then it is likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to molecules 6, 9, and 18.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and no other functional groups, then it is unlikely to have toxic activity (label 0). This rule applies to molecules 7, 10, and 11.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom and a carbon-carbon double bond adjacent to each other, then it is also unlikely to have toxic activity (label 0). This rule applies to molecules 12 and 13.
It's important to note that these rules are based on a limited set of examples and may not apply to all cases. Additionally, there may be many other factors that influence the toxicity of a molecule beyond its structure.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential toxic effects as indicated by the label "1" for those molecules. This rule is based on the fact that these functional groups are known to be associated with toxicity activities in certain compounds.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-), then it may also have potential toxic effects as indicated by the label "1" for that molecule. This rule is based on the fact that such structures can undergo reactions with other molecules leading to the formation of reactive intermediates which can cause damage to cells.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a bromine atom (Br) attached to an sp3 carbon atom, then it likely has potential toxic effects as indicated by the label "1" for that molecule. This rule is based on the fact that halogen atoms, including bromine, can alter the chemical and biological properties of organic molecules and can increase their reactivity towards other molecules.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential toxic effects as they are known to be associated with various health hazards such as cancer, birth defects, and respiratory problems. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be labeled as "1" for potential toxicity.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-CH=CH-), then it may also have potential toxic effects due to the reactivity of the double bond towards nucleophiles. Such compounds should also be labeled as "1" for potential toxicity.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine), then it may also have potential toxic effects due to their ability to react with other molecules and form reactive intermediates. However, this rule is less specific than Rule 1 and Rule 2, and additional information about the context and concentration of the compound would be needed to determine its actual toxicity. Compounds containing halogens but without any other structural features mentioned above should be labeled as "0" for lack of evidence of potential toxicity.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules CCC1(C)CC(=O)NC1=O, CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O, COc1cc(-c2ccc(N=C=O)c(OC)c2)ccc1N=C=O, CN(C)c1ccc(N=O)cc1, CCOP(=O)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, O=C(CCl)c1ccccc1, NC1CCC(CC2CCC(N)CC2)CC1, COc1cc(-c2ccc(N=C=O)c(OC)c2)ccc1N=C=O, ClC(Cl)=C(Cl)Cl, FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1Cl, NS(=O)(=O)c1cc2c(cc1C(F)(F)F)NCNS2(=O)=O, FCC(F)(F)CF,

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 4, 9, 15, and 16.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 7 and 8.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecule 11.
Note that these rules are just examples and should not be considered definitive. It's important to use caution when making predictions about toxicity based solely on structural features.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a benzene ring or a similar aromatic system, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules like Cc1ccc2ncccc2c1, O=CC1CC=CCC1, CSc1ccc(Oc2ccc(S(N)(=O)=O)cc2CN(C)C)cc1C, CCC(C)=NO, CCSC, COc1ccc(C(=O)c2ccc(C)cc2)c(O)c1, CNCCO, NCC(O)COc1ccccc12, NC[C@@H]1CC[C@@H](N)[C@@H](O[C@@H]2[C@@H](N)C[C@@H](N)[C@H](O[C@H]3O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)[C@H](N)[C@H]3O)[C@H]2O)O1, ClCc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, etc.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), then it is also likely to have

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a benzene ring and a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This is because the aromatic ring and the polar carbonyl group may interact with the receptor and trigger its activation. The molecules CCCC(C)(C)OO and CCOC(N)=O both contain these functional groups and have labels of 1.0, indicating their potential for toxicity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom, then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This is because halogen atoms like chlorine are often associated with increased metabolic stability and decreased reactivity, which may reduce their ability to interact with the receptor. The molecules O=[N+]([O-])c1ccc(CCl)cc1 and Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1 both contain chlorine atoms but have labels of 0.0, indicating no evidence of toxicity.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom bonded to two oxygen atoms, then it is also unlikely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This is because sulfur dioxide is a gas at room temperature and may not be able to penetrate

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br) attached to a benzene ring, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway and should be labeled as 1. This rule applies to molecules 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 5

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2) or a thiocarbonyl group (C=S), then it is likely to have no toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway and should be labeled as 0.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O), then it is likely to have no toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway and should be labeled as 0.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a bromine atom attached to a carbon atom next to a double bond (C=C), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway and should be labeled as 1.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided by this dataset and may not hold true for all molecules. It's always best to consult with experts in the field before making any predictions about the biological activity of new compounds.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway:

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl), fluorine (F), or bromine (Br), then it may have potential toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings starting with "CCON", "CF", "CCl", etc. For example, the first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and have been labeled as having potential toxic effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may have potential toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings containing "SN" or "OS". For example, the fifth molecule in the dataset contains this group and has been labeled as having potential toxic effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a benzene ring (c1ccccc1), then it may have potential toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings containing "c1ccccc1" or "C1CCCCC1". For example, the last four molecules in the dataset contain this group and have been labeled as having potential toxic effects.

Rule 1: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it is likely to have toxic activity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 4, 9, 15, and 16.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), then it may have toxic activity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 7, 8, 10, and 11.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), then it is highly likely to have toxic activity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecule 13 only.
It's important to note that these rules are just generalizations and should not be used as the sole criteria for predicting toxicity. Other factors such as dosage, exposure time, and individual susceptibility also play a role in determining the overall toxicity of a molecule.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a benzene ring or a similar aromatic structure, then it is more likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules like "CCON(CC)CCOC(=O)C(C)(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1" and "CCCCCCC(=O)CCCCCC/C=C/C[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@@](N)(CO)C(=O)O".
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a functional group such as a carbonyl group (-C=O) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is also more likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules like "CC(C)(CO)[C@@H](O)C(=O)NCCCC(=O)[O-].CC(C)(CO)[C@@H](O)C(=O)NCCCC(=O)[O-]" and "CCOc1ccccc1OCCN[C@H](C)Cc1ccc(OC)c(S(N)(=O)=O)c1

Based on this dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a bromine atom and no other halogen atoms, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules such as BrC(Br)(CH3)CHO or C6H5C(Br)=CHCOOH.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and a double bond between two carbon atoms, then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules such as O=C(O)C(F)(F)CF3 or CH3C(=O)C(=C)C(OH)(NH2).
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom and no other heteroatoms, then it may have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. However, this rule should be used cautiously since there are exceptions to this trend. For example, CC(C)S does not follow this pattern but still has toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway.

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-CH=CH-), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules like CC(Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl)C(=O)O (with label 0) and O=C(O)CCCCCCCC(=O)O (with label 0).

This rule applies to molecules 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 7, 9, 16, and 28.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is highly likely to have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecule 22.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. However, this rule is less certain than Rules 1 and 2 since only one molecule in the dataset contains a carbonyl group but does not have toxic activity (molecule 10).

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring, then it is likely to have toxic activity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This is because chlorine is known to increase the lipophilicity of molecules, which can lead to increased absorption into cells and potentially harmful interactions with biological systems. The molecule NC1ccc(Cl)cc1 1.0 in the dataset supports this rule.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) connected to a carbon chain, then it may not have toxic activity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This is because carbonyl groups are often involved in hydrogen bonding, which can affect the solubility and reactivity of molecules. The molecule CC(C)OC(=O)/C=C(/C)O[AlH3](OC(C)CC)OC(C)CC 0.0 in the dataset supports this rule.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), then it may not have toxic activity against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This is because sulfonyl groups are often used as protecting groups for other functional groups, and do not themselves contribute significantly to the overall toxicity of a molecule. The molecule O=P([O-])([O-])OC[C@@

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a benzene ring or a similar aromatic system, then it is more likely to have toxic activity than one without such a structure. This is because the aryl hydrocarbon receptor is known to bind to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other molecules containing aromatic rings. Therefore, any molecule that resembles these structures may also interact with the receptor and exhibit toxic effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (i.e. a carbon-oxygen double bond), then it is less likely to have toxic activity compared to ones without such a functional group. Carbonyl groups are often found in organic compounds that are essential for life, so they may not necessarily indicate harmful activity. However, some studies suggest that certain types of carbonyl groups may interfere with normal cellular processes and lead to negative health outcomes.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains chlorine atoms, then it is less likely to have toxic activity compared to ones without them. Chlorine is a halogen element that is commonly used in pharmaceuticals and other industrial applications due to its ability to modify chemical properties and enhance stability. However, excessive exposure to chlorinated compounds can sometimes lead to negative health effects, including cancer and reproductive problems.

It's important to note that these rules are based on a limited set of examples and may not apply to all cases. Additionally, other factors such as concentration, exposure time, and individual susceptibility may also play a role in determining the overall toxicity of a particular compound.
