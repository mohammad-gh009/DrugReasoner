Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61,

================================

Based on these data points, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential for causing adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a nitro group (-NO2), it may have toxic activity towards the NR signaling pathway. This is because both groups are known to be highly reactive and can interact with various biological molecules, leading to negative health outcomes. Therefore, compounds containing these functional groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it may also have toxic activity towards the NR signaling pathway. Sulfonyl groups are commonly found in drugs such as sulfonamides, which are known to have adverse effects including hypersensitivity reactions and idiosyncratic toxicities. Therefore, caution should be taken when using compounds containing this functional group.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as bromine or chlorine), it may have high reactivity and potentially cause adverse effects due to its ability to form covalent bonds with other molecules. However, the specific impact of halogens on toxicity depends on several factors such as the position and number of halogen atoms, as well as the overall chemical context of the compound. Therefore, further evaluation would be needed to determine the exact risk associated with each individual case.

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have potential toxic effects. The first example in the dataset contains a nitro group and has a label of 1, indicating possible toxicity. Similarly, the last two examples contain Cl atoms and also have labels of 1.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (C=C), then it may have potential toxic effects. This is because conjugation can increase the reactivity of the C=O bond, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by biological molecules. The second example in the dataset contains a C=O group conjugated with an alkene group and has a label of 0, indicating no apparent toxicity. However, the third example does not contain any conjugated groups but still has a label of 0, suggesting that other factors may contribute to toxicity.

The sixth example in the dataset contains a sulfonate group and has a label of 0, indicating no apparent toxicity. However, the seventh example contains both a sulfonate group and a benzene ring, which may contribute to toxicity.

Carbonyl groups are commonly found in natural products and are important for their biological activities. However, some carbonyl containing compounds may still exhibit toxic effects due to their reactivity towards other biomolecules.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it is more likely to have toxic effects compared to molecules without this functional group. Sulfonyl groups are often present in pesticides and other industrial chemicals which are known to have toxic effects.

Rule 2: If a compound contains a cyano group (-CN), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecule 12.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a sulfonate group (-SO3-), then it may have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecule 17.
It's important to note that these rules are just educated guesses based on limited data and should be used with caution. Further research and testing would be needed to confirm their validity.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three possible rules for predicting if a given molecule has toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the NR signaling pathway based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a bromine atom (Br) or a chlorine atom (Cl), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 7, 8, 9, 16, and 17.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) conjugated with another double bond such as a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) or a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), then it is also likely to have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom (N) bonded to at least one other non-hydrogen atom, then it may be less likely to have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the NR signaling pathway. However, further research would be needed to confirm this hypothesis. This rule applies to molecules 18, 19, and 20.

This rule is supported by research showing that compounds containing these functional groups can cause adverse health effects such as cancer and other diseases.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may also have potential toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for one of the molecules in the dataset. Sulfonyl groups are known to be toxic and can cause skin irritation, respiratory problems, and other health issues.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains multiple chlorine atoms (-Cl), then it may also have potential toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for two of the molecules in the dataset. Chlorine is a highly reactive element that can interact with other chemicals in the body and cause adverse health effects such as cancer and birth defects.

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a bromine atom, it may have potential toxic effects as indicated by the presence of two molecules labeled with 1 out of four containing bromine atoms. However, this rule alone cannot accurately predict all cases of toxicity since there are also molecules without bromine atoms that are labeled with 1.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), it may have potential toxic effects as indicated by one molecule labeled with 1 out of five containing a cyano group. Again, this rule alone cannot accurately predict all cases of toxicity since there are also molecules without cyano groups that are labeled with 1.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it may have potential toxic effects as indicated by one molecule labeled with 1 out of six containing a sulfonyl group. This rule suggests that the sulfonyl group may play a role in causing toxicity but again, it cannot accurately predict all cases of toxicity since there are also molecules without sulfonyl groups that are labeled with 1.
It's important to note that these rules are based on a limited set of data and should be used cautiously when predicting toxicity for new compounds. It's always best to consult with experts in the field or conduct further research before making any conclusions about the safety of a particular compound.

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, such as in the case of "CCOO", "CC(C)CNCC(C)C", "CC(C)CH", etc., then it may also have toxic activity towards NR signaling pathways.

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have potential toxic effects as indicated by the presence of label 1 for those molecules containing these groups. This rule is supported by research showing that compounds containing these functional groups can disrupt normal cellular processes and lead to negative health outcomes.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (-Cl) or bromine (-Br), then it may also have potential toxic effects as indicated by the presence of label 1 for some of those molecules. Halogen atoms can alter the chemical and physical properties of a compound, which can affect its reactivity and ability to interact with biological systems.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) or a phosphate group (-OPO3R2), then it may have potential toxic effects as indicated by the presence of label 1 for several of those molecules. These functional groups can act as haptens and trigger immune responses, leading to allergic reactions or other negative health outcomes.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three possible rules for predicting if a molecule has toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the NR signaling pathway based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to carbon or oxygen atoms, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the NR signaling pathway.

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to a carbon chain, then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecule 4 only.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) attached to a benzene ring, then it may have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecule 22 only.
Note that these rules are just educated guesses based on the limited information provided in the given dataset. Further research and analysis would be needed to confirm their validity and applicability to other types of molecules and biological systems.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential for causing adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a phosphate group (-OPO32-), it may have toxic effects. The two molecules containing these groups in the dataset both have labels of 0.0, indicating no known association with toxicity. However, further research would need to be done to confirm any link between these functional groups and toxicity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-CH=CH-), it may have toxic effects. This rule is supported by the fact that one of the molecules containing such a group in the dataset has a label of 1.0, indicating a known association with toxicity. Further investigation into the specific structural features required for conjugation would need to be conducted before using this as a predictive rule.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have toxic effects. One of the molecules containing a nitro group in the dataset has a label of 1.0, while another has a label of 0.0. Again, more research would need to be done to determine how common a relationship between nitro groups and toxicity is.
