Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. The presence of these functional groups may increase the binding affinity of the molecule for the target protein.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as fluorine (-F), chlorine (-Cl), bromine (-Br), or iodine (-I), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. Halogen atoms are often used in drug design to improve the pharmacokinetic profile of a compound but may also affect its biological activity.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) or an ester group (-COOR), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. These functional groups may form hydrogen bonds or other interactions with the target protein. However, this rule should be taken with caution since some molecules containing these groups may still have low or no toxicity due to their structure and other factors.

These functional groups are known to be highly reactive and can cause adverse reactions in biological systems.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains multiple aromatic rings, such as c1ccc2c(c1)CCCC2, then it may also have potential toxic effects due to their ability to interact with proteins and disrupt normal cellular processes. This is supported by the fact that many carcinogens contain aromatic rings.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1, then it may also have potential toxic effects because chlorine is often used as a disinfectant and can react with other molecules to form harmful compounds. However, this rule should be taken with caution since some chlorinated compounds are still widely used in medicine and industry without causing significant harm.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a benzene ring or a similar aromatic system, it is more likely to have toxic effects than one without such a system. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 for having potential toxic effects but also applies to some molecules labeled as 0 because they may contain other structural features that contribute to their overall toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a similar functional group that can react with other molecules, it is more likely to have toxic effects than one without such a group. Again, this rule applies to both positive and negative examples in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a long carbon chain or a large ring system, it is less likely to have toxic effects than one with a smaller or simpler structure. This rule only applies to negative examples in the dataset since all positively labeled molecules have relatively small structures.

Therefore, molecules containing either of these functional groups should be labeled as having potential toxic effects (label 1).
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (-C=O) through a single bond, then it may also have potential toxic effects due to the presence of the carbonyl group which can react with other molecules leading to unwanted reactions. Therefore, such molecules should also be labeled as having potential toxic effects (label 1).

Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have potential toxic effects as indicated by the label 0.5 for both molecules containing these groups. However, this rule alone cannot accurately determine if a molecule will have toxic effects since other factors such as concentration, exposure time, and individual susceptibility also play a role.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) attached to an sp3 carbon, then it may have potential toxic effects as indicated by the label 0.5 for one of the molecules in the dataset. This rule suggests that the presence of a halogen atom may increase the reactivity of the molecule and potentially lead to adverse reactions.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, then it may have potential toxic effects as indicated by the label 0.75 for two of the molecules in the dataset. Conjugated systems are known to be highly reactive and can interact with biological molecules leading to adverse effects.

Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) or a thiocarbonyl group (C=S), then it may have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67,

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three possible rules for predicting if a molecule has toxic activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a bromine atom, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway (label 1). This rule applies only to one molecule in the dataset, but it suggests that halogen atoms may play a role in determining toxicity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway (label 0). These functional groups may be associated with reduced toxicity compared to other molecules in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it is more likely to have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway (label 1). Carbonyl groups are commonly found in organic compounds and may contribute to their biological activity. However, this rule should be used cautiously as it does not apply to all molecules containing carbonyl groups.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label "1" for those molecules. This rule is supported by research showing that these functional groups can cause adverse health effects such as skin irritation, respiratory problems, and cancer.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it may also have toxic effects as indicated by the label "1" for one of the molecules in the dataset. Cyano groups can be toxic due to their ability to interfere with cellular respiration and oxidative phosphorylation.
Rule 3: If the molecule does not contain any of the above mentioned functional groups but has a high degree of conjugation, then it may still have toxic effects as indicated by the label "1" for two of the molecules in the dataset. Conjugation can increase the reactivity of the molecule, which can lead to more severe toxic effects. However, this rule should be taken with caution since there may be other factors involved in determining the overall toxicity of a molecule.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three possible rules for predicting if a molecule has toxic activity towards the androgen receptor in NR signalling pathways based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, it tends to have higher probability of being toxic than molecules without halogens. This rule can be applied to the first four SMILES strings where the presence of Cl or Br atoms leads to a label of 1.
Rule 2: Molecules containing functional groups like carbonyl (C=O), nitro (NO2), or sulfonyl (SO2) tend to have lower probabilities of being toxic compared to those without these groups. This rule can be applied to the last two SMILES strings where the absence of C=O group leads to a label of 1.
Rule 3: The length of the carbon chain also plays a role in determining the toxicity of a molecule. Shorter chains may lead to more toxic compounds while longer ones may result in less toxic compounds. For example, the fifth SMILES string has a shorter chain leading to a label of 1 whereas the twelfth SMILES string has a longer chain resulting in a label of 0.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential toxic effects as these groups are known to be associated with toxicity. Therefore, molecules containing either of these groups should be labeled as having potential toxic effects (label 1).
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), then it may also have potential toxic effects due to their ability to disrupt biological systems. Therefore, molecules containing halogens should also be labeled as having potential toxic effects (label 1).
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5) or a naphthalene ring (C10H8), then it may also have potential toxic effects because these rings are commonly found in many toxic compounds. Therefore, molecules containing these rings should also be labeled as having potential toxic effects (label 1).

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a bromine atom bonded to a carbon atom through two single bonds, then it may have potential toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for the first four molecules in the dataset.

However, this rule alone cannot accurately predict all cases of toxicity since there are many other factors that can contribute to toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) connected to another carbon atom through a double bond or triple bond, then it may have potential toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for the fifth molecule in the dataset. This rule suggests that the presence of a carbonyl group conjugated with a double or triple bond may increase the likelihood of toxicity. Again, however, this rule alone cannot accurately predict all cases of toxicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2) attached to a benzene ring, then it may have potential toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for the sixth molecule in the dataset. This rule suggests that the presence of a nitro group attached to a benzene ring may increase the likelihood of toxicity. Once again, however, this rule alone cannot accurately predict all cases of toxicity.

For example, the first four molecules in the dataset contain these functional groups and all have a label of 0.0 indicating no toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2) or a nitrogen-containing ring, such as pyridine or pyrimidine, then it may have potential toxic effects.

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a phenyl ring (c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1 or c1cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccc1), then it is likely to have some toxicity activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 8, 12, 18, 21, and 29.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) attached to a phenyl ring (c1ccc(OS(=O)(=O)NN)cc1 or c1cc(OS(=O)(=O)NN)ccc1), then it is likely to have high toxicity activity towards the androgen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 10, 13, 16, 22, and 27.
