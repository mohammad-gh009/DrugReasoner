Based on this dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule will have toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, it has a higher chance of causing genotoxic damage than molecules without halogens. Therefore, any compound containing these atoms should be labeled as having potential toxicity activity (label 1). This rule applies to compounds 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) or a carboxylic acid group (COOH), then it may have genotoxic effects due to their ability to form covalent bonds with DNA strands. Therefore, molecules containing these functional groups should be labeled as 1 (toxic).
Example: O=C(O)c1ccccc1-c1ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc1 (label 0.0)
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), then it may have mutagenic effects due to its ability to interact with DNA bases and cause mutations. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should also be labeled as 1 (toxic).
Example: Nc1ccccc1-c1ccccc1 (label 0.0)
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br), then it may have endocrine disrupting effects due to their ability to mimic natural hormones. Therefore, molecules containing these atoms should also be labeled as 1 (toxic).
Example: Cc1cccc2[nH]nnc12 (label 0.0)

================================

Based on this dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), or iodine (I), then it is likely to have toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules labeled with 1 in the dataset. For example, CC(CO)(CO)[N+](=O)[O-], FC(F)(F)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, BrCCCBr, O=C(O)CCCl, etc.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), then it may also have toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules labeled with both 0 and 1 in the dataset. For example, CC(=O)C(=O)[O-], Nc1ccc(C(=O)NCC(=O)O)cc1, Cc1ccc(-c2cc(C(F)(F)F)nn2-c2ccc(S(N)(=O)=O)cc2)cc1, etc.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2), then it is less likely to have toxic effects. This rule only applies to

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) and halogen atoms like chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br) may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects. These functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions.
Rule 2: The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule may also increase its potential for causing adverse effects due to their ability to form π-π interactions with other molecules. This can lead to changes in protein structure and function.
Rule 3: The absence of polar functional groups such as hydroxyl (OH) or amine (NH2) groups in a molecule may decrease its potential for causing adverse effects because these groups can interact with water molecules and make the compound more hydrophilic. This makes it easier for the compound to be excreted from the body.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a nitro group (NO2), then it is likely to have genotoxic effects as indicated by ATAD5 in the SR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70

================================

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-), then it is also likely to have genotoxic effects and may cause damage to DNA. Therefore, such molecules should also be labeled as 1 (toxic).
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) attached to an sp3 carbon, then it may disrupt normal cell function and lead to harmful effects. Therefore, such molecules should also be labeled as 1 (toxic).

This rule applies to molecules 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 6

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards ATAD5 in the SR signalling pathway based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards ATAD5 in the SR signalling pathway. This rule applies to molecules Cc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1C, O=C1Nc2ccccc2C1=O, Cl[Si](Cl)(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1, CC(=O)OCC(=O)[C@@]1(OC(C)=O)[C@@H](C)C[C@H]2[C@@H]3C[C@H](F)C4=CC(=O)C=C[C@]4(C)[C@@]3(F)[C@@H](O)C[C@@]21C, CCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)O[Sn](CCCC)(CCCC)OC(=O)CCCCCCCCCCC, Nc1ccccc1C(=O)Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1, COc1ccc(NC(C)=O)cc1N, c1ccc2nccnc

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a silicon atom bonded to two other carbon atoms or oxygen atoms, then it may have genotoxic effects as indicated by ATAD5 in the SR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules #6, #7, and #8.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains bromine atoms attached to the same carbon atom, then it may also have genotoxic effects as indicated by ATAD5 in the SR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecule #9.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom connected to at least one carbon atom and one hydrogen atom, then it may not have any significant genotoxic effects as indicated by ATAD5 in the SR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25, #26, #27, #28, #29, #30, #31, #32, #33, 

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as nitro group (-NO2) and halogen atoms like chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br) increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects. These functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions.
Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic rings have a higher chance of being toxic than those without them. This is because they are more stable and can easily bind to proteins and enzymes, leading to adverse effects.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule also play a role in its toxicity. Longer chains and complex structures may hinder their ability to cross cell membranes and reach target sites within the body. Therefore, simpler compounds tend to be less toxic than larger ones.

================================

Based on this dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains bromine atoms, it is more likely to have toxic effects than molecules without them. This rule applies to five out of ten molecules labeled as having toxic effects (i.e., they contain bromine atoms) but only one out of nine molecules labeled as non-toxic. Therefore, we can say that the presence of bromine atoms increases the likelihood of a molecule being toxic.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains sulfur atoms, it is less likely to have toxic effects than molecules without them. This rule applies to four out of eleven molecules labeled as non-toxic (i.e., they do not contain sulfur atoms) but none of the molecules labeled as toxic. Therefore, we can say that the absence of sulfur atoms increases the likelihood of a molecule being toxic.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains oxygen atoms, it is also less likely to have toxic effects than molecules without them. This rule applies to six out of eight molecules labeled as non-toxic (i.e., they contain oxygen atoms) but no molecules labeled as toxic. However, note that these two rules may not apply universally since there are exceptions to each one. For example, some molecules containing bromine or sulfur atoms may still be non-toxic, while others lacking oxygen atoms may still be toxic.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of halogen atoms such as chlorine and bromine may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects due to their ability to disrupt protein-ligand interactions or alter the electronic structure of the molecule. Therefore, molecules containing these elements should be labeled as 1 if they have any potential for genotoxicity.
Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyls, esters, and amides may also increase the probability of causing adverse effects because they can form hydrogen bonds or other electrostatic interactions with biological targets. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should also be labeled as 1 if they have any potential for genotoxicity.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of the carbon chain may also play a role in determining the likelihood of causing adverse effects. Longer chains may provide more opportunities for interaction with biological targets, while branched or cyclic structures may limit flexibility and accessibility. Therefore, molecules with longer linear chains or fewer branches or rings should be labeled as 1 if they have any potential for genotoxicity.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have genotoxic effects as indicated by ATAD5 in the SR signaling pathway. The presence of this functional group in Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)nn2)cc1 and CC(C)Br suggests they may have such effects. However, further testing would be needed to confirm these predictions.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom like chlorine (Cl), it may also have genotoxic effects. This is evident from O=C(O)c1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl and CCC[N+]1(C)CCCC1.O=S(=O)([O-])C(F)(F)F containing both groups. Again, more research would be necessary to determine their exact impact on toxicity.
Rule 3: Compounds with a carbonyl group (-C=O) or a double bond between carbon atoms (C=C) may also exhibit some level of toxicity. Examples include C=CCOC(=O)CCC1CCCCC1, COC(=O)CC(CC(=O)OCC)(OC(C)=O)C(=O)OCC, and N#CC(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a phosphorus-containing group (e.g. O=PPh3), then it may have genotoxic effects due to their ability to react with DNA and proteins. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be labeled as "1" for potential toxicity.
Rule 2: Molecules containing nitro groups (NO2) or halogens (e.g. Cl, Br, I) may also have genotoxic effects because they can interact with DNA and cause damage. Therefore, such molecules should also be labeled as "1" for potential toxicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) conjugated with an alkene or alkyne functional group, then it may have mutagenic effects due to the ability of this functional group to form adducts with DNA. Therefore, such molecules should also be labeled as "1" for potential toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of negatively charged ions such as [O-] and [OH-] in the molecular structure may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on DNA damage or oxidative stress responses. Therefore, molecules containing these ions should be labeled as 1 if they have any genotoxic activities.
Example: O=C([O-])[O-].[Sr+2] has two negatively charged oxygen atoms which may contribute to its toxic activity towards SR pathways. Hence, this compound was labeled as 0.0.
Rule 2: The presence of halogen atoms such as chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I) in the molecular structure may also increase its potential for causing adverse effects due to their ability to disrupt protein-protein interactions or induce oxidative stress. Therefore, molecules containing halogens should be labeled as 1 if they have any genotoxic activities.
Example: C=CCOC(=O)CCCCCCCC contains one chlorine atom and was labeled as 0.0 because it does not contain any other potentially hazardous features.
Rule 3: Molecules containing functional groups such as carbonyl (C=O), carboxyl (COOH), and sulfhydryl (SH) may interact with proteins or enzymes involved in cellular processes and lead to adverse effects. Therefore, molecules containing these functional groups should be labeled as 1 if they have any genotoxic activities.
Example: CC(=O)Oc1cccc2c1C(=O)

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three possible rules for predicting if a given molecule will have toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl), fluorine (F), bromine (Br), or iodine (I), then it has a high probability of being toxic. This rule applies to molecules 6, 9, 17, 28, and 30.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (C=O) conjugated with an alkene double bond (C=C), then it may be toxic. This rule applies to molecules 10, 11, and 12.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), then it may be toxic. This rule applies to molecules 13 and 14.
It's important to note that these rules are just educated guesses based on limited data and should be used with caution. It's always best to consult with experts in the field before making any conclusions about the toxicity of a particular substance.

================================

Based on this dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a tin atom or a halogen atom such as chlorine, it may have genotoxic effects due to their ability to disrupt cellular processes. Therefore, compounds containing these atoms should be labeled as having potential toxicity activities (label 1).
Rule 2: Compounds containing functional groups like carbonyl (C=O) or carboxylic acid (COOH) may also have toxic effects because they can interact with biological molecules and disrupt normal cell functions. Therefore, compounds containing these functional groups should also be labeled as potentially toxic (label 1).
Rule 3: Compounds containing sulfur or nitrogen atoms bonded to multiple carbon atoms (e.g., C-S-C or C-N-C) may also have toxic effects since they can form covalent bonds with other biomolecules and interfere with their function. Therefore, compounds containing these structures should also be labeled as potentially toxic (label 1).

================================

Based on this dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule will have toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a phosphate group (O=P(O)(O)O) or a sulfonate group (SO3R), it has a high probability of causing genotoxic damage as measured by ATAD5 expression in the SR signaling pathway. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be avoided in drug development.
Rule 2: Molecules containing conjugated double bonds such as CC/C=C\CCCCCO may also have a higher likelihood of causing genotoxic damage due to their ability to interact with DNA. Therefore, they should also be avoided during drug design.
Rule 3: Molecules containing halogen atoms such as chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br) may also increase the risk of toxicity because of their ability to form reactive free radicals which can damage cells. Therefore, drugs containing halogens should be carefully evaluated for potential side effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of chlorine atoms and other halogens may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects as they can disrupt normal biochemical processes within cells. Therefore, molecules containing these elements should be given lower scores for their potential toxicity.
Rule 2: Molecules containing functional groups such as carbonyls or carboxylic acids may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects due to their ability to interact with biological systems. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be given lower scores for their potential toxicity.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure may also play a role in its potential toxicity. Longer chains and more complex structures may make it harder for the body to break down and eliminate the molecule, leading to accumulation and potential harm. Therefore, simpler molecules with fewer rings and branches may be less likely to cause adverse effects.

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it is more likely to have toxic effects than molecules without such a bond. This rule is supported by the fact that ClC(Cl)(Cl)c1ccccc1 and O=S(=O)(Cl)c1c(Cl)cccc1Cl both have a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom and they both have labels of 1. On the other hand, Cc1ncc(CNC(=O)N(CCCl)N=O)c(N)n1 does not contain any chlorine atoms but still has a label of 0.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it is also more likely to have toxic effects. This rule is supported by the fact that CCON(Cc1cccc(S(=O)(=O)[O-])c1)c1ccc(C(=C2C=CC(=[N+](CC)Cc3cccc(S(=O)(=O)[O-])c3)C=C2)c2ccccc2)cc1 and CN(C)CCCCCCN(C)C both contain a nitro group and they both have labels of 0. However

Rule 2: Compounds containing nitro groups (-NO2) may also exhibit genotoxic effects through the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during metabolism. Hence, such molecules should also be considered potentially toxic.
Rule 3: The presence of certain functional groups like carbonyl (C=O), carboxylic acid (COOH), and sulfonic acid (SO3H) may indicate high reactivity and potential toxicity of a compound. These functional groups can interact with biological systems and disrupt normal cellular processes.

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups such as nitro groups or aromatic rings may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, molecules containing these groups have been shown to interact with DNA and disrupt its normal function, leading to genotoxic effects. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be labeled as toxic (label 1).
Rule 2: Molecules containing polar groups such as hydroxyl or amine groups may also increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds with other molecules. These interactions can lead to changes in protein structure and function, which can result in adverse effects. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should also be labeled as toxic (label 1).
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule may also play a role in determining its toxicity. Longer and more complex molecules may be harder for the body to break down and process, leading to accumulation of toxic metabolites and increased risk of adverse effects. Therefore, molecules with longer chains or multiple branches should be labeled as potentially toxic (label 0.5) until further research is conducted to determine their safety.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three possible rules for predicting if a molecule has toxic activity towards genotoxic stress response based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) or a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), then it may have toxic activity towards genotoxic stress response (label 1). This rule applies to molecules such as C=CC(=O)NC(C)(C)CC(C)=O, Nc1ccc(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2N)cc1, O=C/C(Cl)=C(/Cl)C(=O)O, CCSCC(C)CS, CN(C)CC[C@@H](c1ccc(Br)cc1)c1ccccn1, CNC(=O)N(C)c1nnc(C(C)(C)C)s1, BrC(Br)Br, COC(=O)c1ccccc1N, ClCCBr, OC(C)(C)CO, CCC(CO)CO, CCS(C)(=O)=O, NCCSN(C)C, Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(O)cc2)cc1, CCNC(=O)ON=CC(C)(C)SC, O=[Mo](=O)=O, CSC(=O)N(CC(C)C)CC(C)C, NC(=O)N=NC(N)=O, C=CCOC(C)=O, CN[C@H]1

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have genotoxic effects and potentially lead to adverse health outcomes. The molecules Cc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])c(C)c1 and CCC(C)C(C(=O)OCC[N+](C)(CC)CC)c1ccccc1 both contain these groups and have been labeled as having potential toxicity activities.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it may also have genotoxic effects due to its ability to react with DNA. The molecule CC(C)CC(C)(O)C#CC(C)(O)CC(C)C contains two chlorines and has been labeled as having potential toxicity activity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, then it may have electrophilic reactivity and potentially interact with biological systems. The molecule O=C(O)c1ccc(SC(=O)NS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(Cl)cc2)cc1 contains a conjugated system of double bonds and has been labeled as having potential toxicity activity.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a germanium atom, then it is likely to have genotoxic effects as indicated by ATAD5 in the SR signaling pathway. Therefore, molecules containing Ge should be labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have genotoxic effects due to its ability to form reactive radicals. Therefore, such molecules should also be labeled as 1.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) or a double bond between two carbon atoms, then it may have cytotoxic effects. Such molecules should therefore be labeled as 0.
It's important to note that these rules are based on limited data and may need further validation before being applied more broadly. Additionally, other factors such as concentration, exposure time, and individual susceptibility may also play a role in determining the overall toxicity of a particular compound.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have genotoxic effects as indicated by ATAD5 in the SR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules O=C1c2c(O)cccc2[C@H]([C@@H]2O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H]2O)c2cc(CO)cc(O)c21, C=CSc1ccccc1NS(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1F, COC(=O)NNC(=O)CSC1CCCCCC1, CCONC(=O)CSCC1CCCCCC1, CCC(C(=O)OCCSN(C)C)c1ccccc1, CCS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(I)cc1, CN(C)C(=O)OS(C)(=O)=O, FCCCCCCCCCCCF, ClCNN(C)C(=O)OCCSCO, CF3CONHC(=O)C(C#N)C(=O)OH, FCNS(=O)

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three possible rules for predicting if a given molecule will have toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (represented by the SMILES string c1ccc2ccccc2c1 or similar), then it has a high probability of causing genotoxic effects as indicated by ATAD5 in the SR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (represented by the SMILES string Cl or similar), then it may be more likely to cause genotoxic effects due to its ability to react with other molecules. This rule applies to molecules 3, 4, and 5.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (represented by the SMILES string O=NO2 or similar), then it may also be more likely to cause genotoxic effects due to its reactivity. This rule applies to molecule 11 only.
It's important to note that these rules are based on a limited set of examples and should be used with caution when making predictions about new molecules. It's always best to consult with experts in the field before making any decisions based on these rules.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have genotoxic effects as indicated by ATAD5 in the SR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules COc1cnc(NS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(N)cc2)nc1, CC12CCC(CC1=O)C2(C)C, C=CC(=O)CCCCC, CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC(C)C, N=C(N)N.N=C(N)N.O=C(O)O, c1ccc(N)cc1, O=C(Nc1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1)c1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1O, BrC(Br)Br, C=CCn1c(=O)n(CC=C)c(=O)n(CC=C)c1=O, cc1ccc2c(c1)Sc1ccccc1N2CC1CN2CCC1CC2, Cc1cnc(C)c(C)n1, C=CC(=O)NC(C)(C)CC(C)=O, CCSOC(=O)C(C)CC, CCN(C(=O)

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three possible rules for predicting if a given molecule has toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it may have genotoxic effects due to its ability to bind to DNA and disrupt normal cellular processes. Therefore, compounds containing SO2R should be labeled as 1 (toxic).
Rule 2: Compounds containing nitro groups (NO2) may also have genotoxic effects due to their ability to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can damage DNA. Therefore, compounds containing NO2 should also be labeled as 1.
Rule 3: Compounds containing aromatic rings may have higher chances of being toxic compared to those without them. This is because many known carcinogens contain aromatic rings, which can interact with DNA and disrupt normal cellular functions. However, this rule is more general and may need further refinement based on additional data.

================================

Based on this dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a bromine atom, it is more likely to have toxic effects than one without. This is because bromine is known for its ability to disrupt biological systems through oxidative damage or other mechanisms. Therefore, molecules containing bromine may be more likely to trigger the SR signaling pathway and exhibit genotoxic effects.
Rule 2: Molecules with a carbonyl group (C=O) are also more likely to have toxic effects compared to those without. Carbonyl groups can react with amino acids in proteins and alter their function, which can lead to cellular damage and apoptosis. These types of interactions may also activate the SR signaling pathway and contribute to genotoxic effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with a nitro group (NO2) are particularly prone to causing toxic effects due to their high reactivity and ability to form free radicals. Nitro compounds can interact with DNA and RNA, leading to mutations and cell death. They can also interfere with mitochondrial respiration and ATP production, leading to tissue injury and organ failure. Therefore, molecules containing nitro groups may be highly toxic and should be carefully evaluated for potential risks.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfur atom bonded to two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom, then it may have genotoxic effects due to its ability to form covalent bonds with DNA. Therefore, compounds containing this structural feature should be labeled as having potential toxicity activities (label 1). This rule applies to the second SMILES string in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring, then it may have mutagenic effects due to their ability to interact with DNA. Therefore, compounds containing these structural features should also be labeled as having potential toxicity activities (label 1). This rule applies to the thirteenth and fourteenth SMILES strings in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-), then it may have carcinogenic effects due to its ability to react with DNA. Therefore, compounds containing this structural feature should also be labeled as having potential toxicity activities (label 1). This rule applies to the sixteenth SMILES string in the dataset.

================================

Based on this dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) or a thiocarbonyl group (C=S), it may have toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules such as COC(=O)C(C)C(C)=O, OCS, CSCO, CCONHC(=O)CH3, etc. These functional groups are known to be reactive and can interact with other molecules, leading to potential toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains halogen atoms such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), it may also have toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules such as Clc1cccc(Cl)c1, F(CF2)6COOH, CF3SO2NH2, CCl4, etc. Halogen atoms can disrupt normal biochemical processes and lead to cellular damage.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2) or an azide group (N3), it may have toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules such as NO2C6H4OH, N3C6H5, NC(=O)NNC(=O)OCH3, etc. Nitro and azide groups are highly reactive and can interfere with various biological processes, leading to potential toxicity.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it is likely to have genotoxic effects as indicated by ATAD5 in the SR signaling pathway. The molecules with labels "1.0" contain such a functional group while those with labels "0.0" do not.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene or alkyne group (-C=C- or -C≡C-), then it may also have genotoxic effects due to the presence of a reactive enone or ynone intermediate. This rule applies to molecules with labels "1.0" and "0.0".
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (e.g. F, Cl, Br, I) attached to an sp3 carbon, then it may have some degree of reactivity towards nucleophiles like DNA or proteins. Therefore, it is possible that these types of compounds could exhibit genotoxic effects. However, further analysis would be needed to confirm this hypothesis. This rule only applies to molecules with labels "0.0" since none of the molecules with labels "1.0" contain halogens.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards ATAD5 in the SR signalling pathway (label 1). This rule applies to molecules NS(=O)(=O)c1cc2c(cc1Cl)NC(Cc1ccccc1)NS2(=O)=O and CC(C)CNC(=O)CSc1ccc(Cl)s1.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene or alkyne group (-C=C- or -C≡C-), then it is also likely to have toxic activity towards ATAD5 in the SR signalling pathway (label 1). This rule applies to molecules Cc1cccc(Ns2ns(C)(=O)c3ccccc3c2)c1 and CCCCONC(=O)CSCc1ccccc1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as bromine (-Br), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards ATAD5 in the SR signalling pathway (label 0). This rule applies to molecules Cc1ccc2c(Br)cc(Br)c(O)c2n1 and BrC(Br)C(Br)(Br)Br.
It's important to note that these rules are based on a limited set of examples and may not apply to all cases.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three possible rules for predicting if a given molecule will have toxic effects based on its structure and properties:

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a nitrogen atom, then it may also have potential genotoxic effects. This is because the carboxylic acid group can react with DNA and cause mutations. The third molecule in the dataset contains this group and has a label of 0.0 indicating no observed toxicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it may have potential mutagenic effects due to their ability to interact with DNA. The last four molecules in the dataset contain either chlorine or bromine atoms and all have labels of 0.0 indicating no observed toxicity.
