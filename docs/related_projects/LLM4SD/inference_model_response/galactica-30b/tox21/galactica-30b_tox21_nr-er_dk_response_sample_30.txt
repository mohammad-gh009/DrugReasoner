Based on these data points and their corresponding labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), then it may have toxic effects as indicated by two out of four molecules labeled as 1 containing this functional group. However, there are also several examples where molecules without C=O groups are still labeled as 1, indicating that other factors such as size, shape, and charge distribution may play a role in determining toxicity.
Rule 2: Molecules with sulfur atoms appear more likely to have toxic effects than those without them, as seen from five out of six molecules labeled as 1 containing sulfur. This suggests that sulfur-containing compounds may have specific interactions with biological systems that lead to adverse outcomes.
Rule 3: There does not seem to be any clear pattern relating molecular weight or hydrophobicity to toxicity, as both positive and negative labels are found across a range of values for these properties.

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. This is because these functional groups are known to interact with receptors in the NR family and disrupt their normal function. The molecules containing these groups in the provided dataset all have labels of 1, indicating they do indeed have such toxic effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sodium ion (Na+) bonded to a sulfate group (-OSO3-), then it may also have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. This is because Na+ ions can interfere with the binding of ligands to receptors in the NR family, leading to dysregulation of downstream signaling pathways. The molecule containing both Na+ and SO42- in the provided dataset has a label of 1, supporting this rule.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl) attached to a carbon atom that is part of a ring structure, then it may have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. This is because Cl atoms can act as electron-withdrawing groups, which can alter the electronic properties of nearby functional groups and potentially affect their interactions with receptors in the NR family. The two molecules containing Cl atoms in the provided dataset both have labels of

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. This is because these functional groups are known to be highly reactive and can interact with various biological molecules, leading to adverse health outcomes. For example, the first two SMILES strings in the dataset contain such groups and both have been labeled as having toxic effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may also have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. This is because halogens can form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues in proteins, which can alter their function and lead to negative consequences. The fifth and sixth SMILES strings in the dataset contain such groups and both have been labeled as having toxic effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen-containing ring (such as pyridine or pyrimidine), then it is less likely to have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. This is because such rings are commonly found in natural products and drugs, and are generally considered to be safe for human use. However, it's important to note that there are exceptions to this rule, and some nitrogen-containing rings can still have toxic

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (C=O) or a sulfonyl group (SO2R), then it may have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to compounds 6, 8, 9, 17, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32, 33, 35, and 36.
Rule 2: If a compound contains halogen atoms such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, then it may also have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to compounds 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, and 34.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a nitro group (NO2), then it may have toxic effects towards the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies only to compound 7.
It's important to note that these rules are just generalizations and should not be used as the sole basis for predicting toxicity without further testing.

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains two Cl atoms. Therefore, we can assign a label of 1 for this molecule.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. The second last molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule but its label is 0, which indicates no toxic activity. This suggests that Rule 2 may not be a strong predictor of toxic activity.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. The third molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule and its label is 1, indicating toxic activity. However, note that there are other molecules in the dataset that do not contain NO2 groups yet they still have toxic activity, so this rule should be used cautiously.

This rule is based on the fact that bromine atoms are known to increase the reactivity of molecules and may interact with biological systems in ways that lead to toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of alternating single and double bonds, such as in the case of CC(C)=CCC/C(C)=C/CC/C(C)=C/CC/C=C(\C)CC/C=C(\C)CCC=C(C)C, then it is also likely to have toxic effects as indicated by a label of 1. Conjugated systems are often associated with increased reactivity and may interact with biological systems in ways that lead to toxicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom bonded to two carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom in a ring structure (CS/C(C)=N/OC(=O)N(C)SN(C)C(=O)O/N=C(\C)SC), then it is unlikely to have toxic effects as indicated by a label of 0. Sulfur-containing rings are common in natural products and do not typically exhibit significant toxicity.

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-), then it is also likely to have toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (-C6H5) or a naphthalene ring (-C10H7), then it may have toxic effects towards the estrogen receptor in the NR signaling pathway. However, this rule is less specific than Rules 1 and 2. It applies to molecules 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
