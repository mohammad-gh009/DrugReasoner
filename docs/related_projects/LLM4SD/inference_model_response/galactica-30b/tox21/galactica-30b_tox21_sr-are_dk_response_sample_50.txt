Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to have toxic activity as indicated by the presence of the label "1" for the SMILES strings starting with "O=C(N/N=C/c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])o1)c1cc([N+](=O)[O-])cc([N+](=O)[O-])c1O" and "NCCNc1cccc2ccccc12". Nitro groups are known to be highly reactive and can cause adverse effects such as mutagenicity and carcinogenicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-), it is also likely to have toxic activity as indicated by the presence of the label "1" for the SMILES string starting with "CCCC1CCCC(=O)O1". Conjugated carbonyl groups can react with DNA and proteins leading to adverse health effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains chlorine atoms, it is less likely to have toxic activity as indicated by the absence of any label "1" for the SMILES strings containing Cl atoms except for one case where the compound was labeled as having no toxic activity due to the presence of fluorine atoms instead of chlorine atoms. Fluorine

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a bromine atom, then it is likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to molecules 4, 9, 15, and 26.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), then it may have toxic activity (label 0 or 1). This rule applies to molecules 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24. However, note that some carbonyl groups may not contribute to toxicity, so further analysis would be needed to determine their impact.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), then it is highly likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to molecule 2 only.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This is because the nitro group is known to be highly reactive and can cause adverse effects by interacting with other molecules in the body.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it is also likely to have toxic activity (label 1). Chlorine atoms are often associated with environmental pollutants and can disrupt normal biological processes.
Rule 3: If the molecule does not contain any of these features but still has toxic activity (label 1), then it may indicate that there are other factors at play such as hydrophobicity, molecular weight, or charge. These factors should be further investigated to determine their impact on toxicity.

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards Nrf2 ARE SR signaling pathway based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards Nrf2 ARE SR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules ClCc1ccccc1Cl, O=C(O)c1c(Cl)ccc2cc(Cl)cnc12, NC(=O)C(Cl)Cl, C=CCCC#N, CCC[N+](=O)[O-], CC(=O)N(c1onc(C)c1C)S(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, CNS(=O)(=O)Cc1ccc2[nH]cc(CCN(C)C)c2c1, COC1=C(OC)C(=O)C(CCCCCCCCCCO)=C(C)C1=O, CN/C(=N\C#N)NCCSCc1nc[nH]c1C, CCS(C)(=O)OCCCC, CNC(=O)O/N=C/C(C)(C)S(C)=O, c1cc[nH]c(=O)[nH]1, NCCCCCCCP(=O)(O)O, OC(CCl)Nc1ccccc1, CNS(=O)(=O

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:

Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it is likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to molecules 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 6

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains iodine atoms, it tends to have higher chances of causing adverse effects as indicated by the presence of two molecules with label 1 containing iodine atoms out of four total molecules labeled as 1. However, this rule alone may not be sufficient to make accurate predictions since there are also other factors such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and charge that could affect the toxicity of a molecule.
Rule 2: Molecules with high electronegativity elements like fluorine tend to have lower toxicity due to their ability to form strong bonds with other atoms which makes them less reactive. This is supported by the fact that all five molecules without any halogen atoms have been labeled as 0 while only one molecule with fluoride atoms has been labeled as 1. Therefore, we can conclude that the absence of highly electronegative elements like fluorine in a molecule increases its likelihood of being toxic.
Rule 3: The presence of multiple rings in a molecule does not necessarily increase its toxicity as seen from the examples provided where both molecules with single ring and those with multiple rings have been labeled as either 0 or 1. Therefore, the number of rings in a molecule may not be a significant factor when predicting its toxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom, then it is likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to molecules like ClC/C=C/CCl and CCC(=O)C1CC(C(C)C)CC=C1C.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is highly likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to molecules like Nc1ncn([C@@H]2O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)[C@H]2O)c(=O)n1 and O=Cc1cccc(Br)c1.
Rule 3: If the molecule does not contain any of the above features but has a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have some level of toxic activity (label 0 or 1). This rule applies to molecules like CCON(C)CCCC(C#N)(c2ccc(OC)c(OC)c2)C(C)C and COc1ccc(CCNC(C)(C)C)cc1OC.
It's important to note that these rules are just educated guesses based on the limited information provided by the dataset. Further research and analysis would be

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the SR signaling pathway. This is because the nitro group is known to be highly reactive and can interact with various biological molecules leading to cellular damage. The presence of a nitro group in a molecule may disrupt normal cell function and lead to adverse effects. Therefore, any molecule containing a nitro group should be carefully evaluated for potential toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it is also likely to have toxic activity towards the SR signaling pathway. Chlorine atoms are often present in industrial chemicals and pesticides, which can cause adverse health effects when exposed to humans or animals. These compounds can interfere with normal metabolic processes and lead to tissue damage or other adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it is less likely to have toxic activity towards the SR signaling pathway. Carbonyl groups are commonly found in natural products and are important for maintaining normal physiological functions. However, some carbonyl-containing compounds such as aldehydes and ketones can be harmful at high concentrations and can cause adverse effects such as skin irritation or respiratory problems.
It's worth noting that these rules are based on limited data and may need to be refined as more information becomes available. Additionally, there may

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it tends to have higher toxicity activity towards the SR signaling pathway. This is because the nitro group is known to be highly reactive and can interact with various biological molecules leading to cellular damage and apoptosis. Therefore, compounds containing the nitro group should be avoided as much as possible during drug development.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it also tends to have high toxicity activity towards the SR signaling pathway. However, this rule may not be as strong as Rule 1 since some carbonyl groups are essential for protein function and stability. Therefore, careful consideration must be taken when designing drugs that contain such functional groups.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains halogen atoms like chlorine or bromine, it tends to have lower toxicity activity towards the SR signaling pathway. This is likely due to their inertness and low reactivity compared to other functional groups. Therefore, incorporating halogens into a compound can potentially improve its pharmacokinetic profile without compromising its safety.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to molecules 5, 9, and 16.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may not have toxic activity (label 0). This rule applies to molecules 7 and 8.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) adjacent to a double bond (-C=C-), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity (label 0). This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.
Note that these rules are just educated guesses based on the limited information provided in the dataset. Further research and analysis would be needed to confirm their validity and applicability to other datasets.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as FB(F)F, O=C=NC1CCCCC1, C=CCc1ccc2c(c1)OCO2, CC(C)c1ccccc1O, COP(C)(=O)OC, CCCCCOCCOC(=O)CCCCCCCCC(=O)OCCOCCCC, Brc1cc(-c2ccc(Br)c(Br)c2Br)cc(Br)c1Br, OCSCc1ccccc1, NC=O, Nc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])c(C(F)(F)F)c1, Cc1cc(Cl)ccc1/N=C/N(C)C, Cc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])c([N+](=O)[O-])c1, ClCCOCOCCCl, FCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC/C=C(C)/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C1=C(C)CCCC1(C)C, Oc1ccc(C(=O)C(=O)[O

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it tends to have higher toxicity activity towards the SR signaling pathway than molecules without it. This is because the nitro group is known to be highly reactive and can disrupt cellular processes by binding to proteins and enzymes. Therefore, we can assign a label of 1 for any molecule containing a nitro group regardless of other structural features.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a metal ion such as manganese (Mn+2), it also tends to have high toxicity activity due to the ability of metals to catalyze redox reactions and generate free radicals. Therefore, we can assign a label of 1 for any molecule containing a metal ion.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfhydryl group (-SH), it may have lower toxicity activity compared to those without it since sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen and does not readily form strong bonds with other atoms. However, further research would be needed to confirm this hypothesis. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive prediction about the toxicity activity of molecules containing a sulfhydryl group at this time.

================================

Based on this dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it is likely to have toxic activity (label 1) unless there is another functional group present that cancels out the effects of the chlorine atom. For example, in the case of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1c(Cl)cc(C)cc1Cl, the presence of the sulfur atom may neutralize the toxic effects of the chlorine atom.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a cyclic ring, then it is more likely to have toxic activity (label 1) than if it does not contain such a group. This is because the carbonyl group can react with other molecules and disrupt their normal functions. For instance, CC(C)Oc1ccc2c(=O)c(-c3ccccc3)coc2c1 has a carbonyl group attached to a six-membered ring, which makes it more likely to have toxic activity compared to Cc1cc(Cl)c(C)cc1Cl, which only has a single chlorine atom without any additional functional groups.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms, then it is less likely to have toxic activity (label 0) regardless of what other functional groups are present

This rule applies to molecules 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) followed by a double bond (C=X) where X is any atom except oxygen, then it may have toxic activity against the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 antioxidant responsive element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CC(=O)OCC(=O)[C@H]1CC[C@H]2[C@@H]3CCC4=CC(=O)CC[C@]4(C)[C@H]3CC[C@]12C and O=Cc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyclopropane ring connected to another carbon atom through a single bond, then it may not have toxic activity. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings Cc1cccc(C)c1NC(=O)C(C)N and CCCC(=O)OCCO.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have toxic activity. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings NC(=O)NO and COC(=O)c

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to two carbon atoms, then it is likely to have toxic activity against the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 antioxidant responsive element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway. This rule applies only to the first SMILES string in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) followed by a carbon chain, then it may not have any toxic activity. This rule applies to the second and third SMILES strings in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to four other atoms including one oxygen atom, then it may not have any toxic activity. This rule applies to the last six SMILES strings in the dataset.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it is likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to molecules 4, 7, 8, 15, and 16.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is also likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to molecules 9 and 10.
Rule 3: If the molecule does not contain any of these groups but has a high number of rotatable bonds, then it may still have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to molecules 11, 12, and 13.
Note that these rules are just examples and should not be used as the only criteria for predicting toxicity. It's important to consider other factors such as the dose, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility when evaluating the potential health risks associated with a particular chemical.

Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) bonded to a carbon atom that also has two other bonds, one of which is a double bond (-C=C-), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity (label 0). This rule applies to molecules 8, 9, and 10.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to molecules 11 and 12.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a benzene ring (represented by the SMILES string c1ccccc1), then it is more likely to have toxic activity than molecules without this substructure. This rule applies to five out of ten molecules in the dataset, all of which have a benzene ring and receive a label of 1. However, there are also several molecules without a benzene ring that still exhibit toxic activity, so this rule should only be considered as a general trend rather than a definitive predictor.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a phosphate group (represented by the SMILES string O=P(O)(Oc1ccccc1)Oc1ccccc1), then it is less likely to have toxic activity than molecules without this substructure. This rule applies to one molecule in the dataset, which receives a label of 0 despite containing a phosphate group. It is possible that other factors such as the overall charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule may play a role in determining its toxicity, but this rule provides some insight into how certain functional groups may affect the activity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (represented by the SMILES strings Cl or C(Cl)(Cl)(Cl)Cl), then it is more likely to have toxic activity than molecules without this substructure. This rule applies to four molecules in the dataset, all of which contain at least one chlorine atom and receive a label of

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a metal ion such as chromium or platinum, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards the SR signaling pathway. This rule is supported by the fact that these metals are known to induce oxidative stress and damage DNA, which can lead to cellular apoptosis.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is also likely to have toxic activity towards the SR signaling pathway. This rule is supported by the fact that nitro compounds are known to cause liver injury and other adverse effects due to their ability to generate reactive oxygen species.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), then it may not necessarily have toxic activity towards the SR signaling pathway. However, it is important to note that the presence of a carbonyl group does not necessarily indicate safety, as some molecules containing carbonyl groups have been associated with toxicity. Therefore, additional factors such as the type of carbonyl group, its position within the molecule, and its chemical environment should also be considered when predicting toxicity.

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a silicon atom bonded to four carbon atoms, it may not have any toxic activity towards the SR signaling pathway. This rule applies to C[Si](C)(C)C.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains two nitrogen atoms connected by a carbonyl group (-C=O), it may not have any toxic activity towards the SR signaling pathway. This rule applies to CNC(=O)NC.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the provided dataset and should be further validated using additional experimental evidence before being applied to other compounds.

Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl), then it may have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to molecules 7 and 10.
It's important to note that these rules are based on a limited set of examples and should be used cautiously when predicting the toxicity of new molecules. It's always best to consult with experts in the field for more accurate predictions.

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfur atom bonded to two oxygen atoms, then it is likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to the SMILES string O=S(=O)([O-])[S-] which has a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) known for its toxicity.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-), then it is also likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to the SMILES strings C=C(C)C(=O)OCCCCCCCC(C)C and CC(=O)c1ccc2c(c1)Cc1ccccc1-2. The presence of both groups suggests that they may interact with biological molecules through a mechanism such as Michael addition.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is highly likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to the SMILES string CN(C)CCN(C)CCO which has a nitro group attached to a carbon atom. Nitro compounds are well-known for their toxicity due to their ability to form reactive intermediates during metabolism.

This rule applies to molecules like O=C([O-])P(=O)([O-])[O-] (with label 0) and COc1cc(OC)cc(OC)c1 (with label 0). However, this rule should be taken with caution as some phosphates are essential for cellular functions.

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it is likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to molecules 4, 7, 9, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 122, 124, 126, 128, 130, 132, 134, 136, 138, 140

Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-C#N) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have toxic activity towards the SR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it tends to have high toxicity activity towards the SR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules like CCOP(=S)(S)OCC and CNC(=O)c1ccccc1.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to molecules 5, 7, 9, 16, and 28.

Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have toxic activity (label 1) but there are exceptions like molecule 3 which does not contain any functional groups mentioned above yet still has toxic activity. Therefore, this rule should be taken with caution.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a dioxolane ring, then it is likely to have toxic activity against the NFE2L2 ARE SR pathway. The first two molecules in the dataset contain this ring and both have a label of 1, indicating they have toxic activity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, then it is unlikely to have toxic activity against the NFE2L2 ARE SR pathway. The fourth molecule in the dataset contains this group and has a label of 0, indicating it does not have toxic activity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains chlorine atoms, then it may have toxic activity against the NFE2L2 ARE SR pathway. The last four molecules in the dataset all contain chlorine atoms and have mixed labels, so it's difficult to make a definitive prediction without more information. However, these molecules do suggest that halogenation can increase the likelihood of toxic activity.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it is likely to have toxic activity against the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 antioxidant responsive element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules like CN(C)c1ccc(N=NS(=O)(=O)[O-])cc1 which has a sulfonamide group. The presence of this functional group may disrupt the SR signaling pathway leading to adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a siloxane group (-SiO-), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity against the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 antioxidant responsive element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules like CCO[Si](CC)(OCC)OCC which has a siloxane group. The absence of this functional group may indicate that the molecule does not have any toxic activity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a double bond between two carbon atoms (-C=C-), then it is likely to have toxic activity against the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 antioxidant responsive element in the stress response (SR) signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules like C=CC(=O)CC which has both a carbonyl group and a double bond between two carbon atoms. The presence of these functional groups may increase the reactivity of the molecule leading

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to two carbon atoms, then it has high probability of having toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to molecules like Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl and ClC(Cl)=C(Cl)Cl.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a benzene ring, then it also has high probability of having toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to molecules like Cc1ccccc1N and Nc1ccccc1C(=O)OCCc1ccccc1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) attached to a carbon atom, then it may have low probability of having toxic activity (label 0). However, more data would be needed to confirm this rule. This rule applies to molecules like O=C(O)CS and CC(=O)/C=C/C1=C(C)CCCC1(C)C.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a silicon atom, then it is less likely to have toxic activity as indicated by the first SMILES string labeled as 0.0. This may be due to the fact that silicon is not commonly found in biological systems and therefore does not interact with them in any significant way.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) conjugated with an aromatic ring, such as in the second SMILES string labeled as 1.0, then it is more likely to have toxic activity. This may be because conjugation increases the stability of the carbonyl group, making it more reactive and potentially harmful.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), such as in the third SMILES string labeled as 0.0, then it is also more likely to have toxic activity. This may be because nitro groups are known to be highly reactive and can cause damage to cells through various mechanisms.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a bromine atom, it is likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to the third SMILES string in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may not have toxic activity (label 0). This rule applies to the second SMILES string in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a gold atom (Au) bonded to two chlorine atoms, it is highly likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to the fifth SMILES string in the dataset.
It's important to note that these rules are just generalizations and should not be used as the only criteria for predicting toxicity. Other factors such as dosage, exposure time, and individual susceptibility also play a role in determining the overall impact of a compound on an organism.

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a metal ion such as Mn+2, then it is likely to have toxic activity against the SR signaling pathway. This rule applies only to one molecule in the dataset, which has a manganese ion and a label of 1.

This rule applies to two molecules in the dataset, which do not contain any metals but have a label of either 0 or 1 depending on other factors.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) attached to an aliphatic chain, then it may have toxic activity against the SR signaling pathway. This rule applies to four molecules in the dataset, all of which have a label of 1.
It's important to note that these rules are just generalizations based on the limited information provided by the dataset. The actual mechanism of action for each molecule would need to be studied further to determine its specific effects on the SR signaling pathway.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have toxic activity towards the SR signaling pathway. The first molecule in the list contains this functional group and has a label of 1, indicating toxic activity.

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure and properties:

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure and properties:

It's important to note that these rules are just educated guesses based on limited data and may not apply to all cases. It's always best to consult with experts in the field for more accurate predictions.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), it may have toxic activity as seen in the third SMILES string where the presence of -CN leads to a positive label. However, this rule alone cannot accurately determine if a molecule will have toxic activity since other factors such as concentration, exposure time, and environmental conditions also play a role.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it may have toxic activity as seen in the twelfth SMILES string where the presence of -SO2NH2 leads to a negative label. This rule suggests that certain functional groups may increase the likelihood of toxic activity but again, it should not be used as the sole criterion for predicting toxicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains chlorine atoms, it may have toxic activity as seen in the thirteenth SMILES string where two Cl atoms lead to a positive label. While chlorine is often used as a disinfectant, excessive exposure to chlorination byproducts has been linked to health risks including cancer and reproductive issues. Therefore, the presence of chlorine atoms in a molecule does not necessarily indicate safety but rather highlights potential hazards associated with their use.
