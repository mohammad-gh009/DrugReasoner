Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom, then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for molecules like O=S(=O)(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 and Cc1cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccc1N. However, there may be exceptions to this rule since some molecules without chlorines also have toxic effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), then it is more likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for molecules like CC(C)(C)c1ccc(N)cc1 and CCCSCC(=O)O. This is because carbonyl groups can react with other molecules and disrupt normal cellular processes.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is highly likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for molecules like O=C(NO)c1ccccc1 and COC(=O)CC(C)CCC=C(C)C. Nitro groups can act as electron-withdrawing groups and alter the chemical properties of nearby atoms, which can lead to harmful reactions within cells.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to two carbon atoms, then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for molecules like Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl and Clc1ccc(C(c2ccccc2)C(Cl)Cl)cc1. This rule suggests that the presence of halogen atoms like chlorine may increase the likelihood of toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom bonded to two carbon atoms and no other heteroatoms, then it is unlikely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label 0 for molecules like S=C=S and C#CC(C)(O)CC(C)C. This rule suggests that the presence of only sulfur atoms without any other heteroatoms may not lead to toxicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to one carbon atom and another oxygen atom, then it is also unlikely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label 0 for molecules like CCOSSC(CCO)=C(C)N(C=O)Cc1cnc(C)nc1N and CCC(C(=O)OCCN(CC)CC)c1ccccc1. This rule suggests that the presence of both nitrogen and oxygen atoms together may not lead to toxicity.

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for molecules 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80,

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine, bromine or fluorine, then it is likely to have toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects based on its structure and properties:

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it is likely to have toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules 4, 7, 9, 15, and 16.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a carbon chain, then it may have toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules 8, 10, 11, 12, and 13.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), then it may have toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules 14 and 17.
It's important to note that these rules are just educated guesses based on limited data and should be used with caution. It's always best to consult with experts in the field for accurate predictions.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have toxic effects as seen in the first SMILES string where there is a nitro group present. This rule is supported by research showing that compounds containing nitro groups can cause liver damage and other adverse health effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (>C=O) conjugated with an alkene (-C=C-), it may also have toxic effects as seen in the second SMILES string where there is a carbonyl group present adjacent to an alkene. This rule is supported by research showing that compounds containing such functional groups can cause skin irritation and other adverse health effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl) bonded to an oxygen atom (O), it may have toxic effects as seen in the thirteenth SMILES string where there is a Cl-O bond present. This rule is supported by research showing that compounds containing halogen atoms can cause respiratory problems and other adverse health effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have toxic effects as seen in the first SMILES string with label 1. This rule is based on research showing that sulfonyl groups can disrupt cellular respiration by inhibiting ATP synthesis.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains multiple fluorine atoms, it may also have toxic effects as seen in the second SMILES string with label 1. Fluorine is known to increase lipophilicity which can lead to bioaccumulation and increased toxicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, it may also have toxic effects as seen in the third SMILES string with label 1. Conjugated systems can facilitate electron transfer reactions which can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage cells.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br), then it is likely to have toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 

================================

Based on this dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it may have toxic effects as seen in molecules like N#CCCCl, C[As](C)(=O)O, Nc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1, COC(=O)c1ccccc1N, CCc1cccc(CC)c1NC(=O)CN(CC(=O)O)CC(=O)O, O=c1cc(CO)occ1O, CN1C(=O)CC(c2ccccc2)C1=O, Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl, NCC(CC(=O)O)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, COCC(C)OC(C)=O, CCN/C(=N\C#N)NCCSCc1csc(N=C(N)N)n1, C[C@@H]1C[C@H]2[C@@H]3CCC4=CC(=O)C=C[C@]4(C)[C@@]3(F)[C@@H](O)C[C@]2(C

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the presence of label 1 for molecules CCC#N and O=S(=O)(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c1ccc(Cl)cc1. However, this rule alone may not be sufficient to accurately predict all cases of toxicity since there are other factors such as concentration, exposure time, and individual susceptibility that also play a role.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it is unlikely to have toxic effects as indicated by the absence of label 1 for molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1. This observation suggests that the sulfonyl group may have a stabilizing effect on the molecule's structure and prevent it from causing any adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl) attached to an aromatic ring, then it is more likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the presence of label 1 for molecule Clc1ccc(C2(Cn3cncn3)OCCO2)c(Cl)c1 and BrCc1ccc(Br)cc1. This observation suggests that the halogenated aromatic rings may have

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl chloride group (-SO2Cl), it may have toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for ClSC(Cl)(Cl)Cl. However, this rule alone cannot accurately predict all cases of toxicity since there are other molecules without sulfonyl chloride groups that also have toxic effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for CC(=O)N(O)CCCCCNC(=O)CCC(=O)N(O)CCCCCNC(=O)CCC(=O)N(O)CCCCCN. This rule is supported by previous studies showing that nitro compounds can cause adverse health effects such as cancer and birth defects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), it may have toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for CNC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1. Cyano compounds are known to be highly reactive and can cause damage to DNA and other cellular components.
It's important to note that these rules are just generalizations and should not be used as the sole basis for predicting toxicity. Other factors such as dose, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility must also be considered when evaluating the safety of a chemical.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to have toxic effects as seen in SMILES strings labeled with 1. This is because nitro groups are known to be highly reactive and can cause damage to cells by oxidizing proteins and DNA.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a mercury atom (Hg) bonded to a carbon atom through a carbonyl group (C=O), it may also have toxic effects as seen in one of the SMILES strings labeled with 1. Mercury is a heavy metal that can disrupt cellular processes and lead to cell death.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl) attached to a carbon atom in a position ortho to a nitrogen atom (N), it is less likely to have toxic effects as seen in some of the SMILES strings labeled with 0. Chlorine atoms are often present in pharmaceuticals and other chemicals but are not typically associated with toxicity.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three possible rules for predicting if a molecule has toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as "-NO2" or "-COOH", then it is more likely to have toxic effects compared to molecules without these groups. This rule is supported by the fact that both molecules labeled as 1 contain these groups while none of those labeled as 0 do. However, this rule should be used cautiously since there may be other factors that contribute to toxicity beyond just the presence of certain functional groups.
Rule 2: Molecules containing halogen atoms like fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine tend to have higher toxicity than those without them. This rule is supported by the fact that all four molecules labeled as 1 contain at least one halogen atom while only two out of six molecules labeled as 0 do. Again, however, this rule should be used carefully because some halogens may not necessarily increase toxicity and other factors may play a role.
Rule 3: Molecules with a high degree of symmetry or planarity may also have increased toxicity due to their ability to interact with biological systems in unique ways. This rule is supported by the fact that both molecules labeled as 1 have highly symmetric structures while most of those labeled as 0 do not. However, again, this rule should be used with caution since there may be exceptions and other factors that influence toxicity.

================================

Based on this dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to have toxic effects than molecules without it. This is because nitro groups are known to be highly reactive and can cause damage to cells by oxidizing proteins and DNA. Therefore, any compound containing a nitro group should be carefully evaluated for its potential toxicity.
Rule 2: Molecules with a carbonyl group (-C=O) are also more likely to have toxic effects compared to those without them. Carbonyl groups can react with amino acids in proteins and form adducts, which can lead to cell death or other adverse effects. However, it's important to note that not all compounds with carbonyl groups will exhibit toxicity, so additional factors such as concentration and exposure time must also be considered.
Rule 3: Compounds with a high degree of conjugation between multiple double bonds or aromatic rings may also be more prone to toxicity due to their increased reactivity and ability to interact with biological systems. For example, compounds like naphthalene and benzoquinone have been shown to be highly toxic due to their ability to form covalent bonds with cellular components.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to have toxic effects than molecules without this functional group. This is because nitro groups are known to be highly reactive and can interact with other molecules in biological systems, leading to adverse effects. Therefore, any molecule containing a nitro group should be labeled as having toxic effects (label 1).
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it may also have toxic effects due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and react with other molecules. However, this rule is less specific than Rule 1 since there are many different types of carbonyl groups with varying reactivities. Therefore, any molecule containing a carbonyl group should be labeled as potentially having toxic effects (label 0.5).
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it is unlikely to have toxic effects since these groups are often found in non-toxic compounds such as detergents and solvents. Therefore, any molecule containing a sulfonyl group should be labeled as not having toxic effects (label 0).

================================

Based on this dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), then it is more likely to have toxic effects than molecules without such groups. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1.0 in the dataset. For example, the SMILES strings COC(C)=O, CC(C)(C)c1ccccc1, O=C(O)CNC(=O)c1ccccc1, C=CC(C)CCC=C(C)C, etc. contain a carbonyl group and are all labeled as 1.0. On the other hand, molecules like CCCc1cc(C(N)=S)ccn1 do not contain a carbonyl group but still have toxic effects and are also labeled as 1.0. Therefore, Rule 1 should only be considered as a general guideline and not a definitive predictor of toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2), then it is less likely to have toxic effects compared to molecules without such groups. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 0.0 in the dataset. For instance, the SMILES string O=S(=O)([O-])CCS does not contain any carbonyl group but does not have toxic effects either and is therefore labeled as 0.0. Similarly, molecules like CN/C(=N\[N+](=O)[O-])NCc1cnc(Cl)s1,

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have toxic effects as seen in SMILES strings "CCCC[n+]1ccc(C)cc1.O=S(=O)([O-])C(F)(F)F 0.0" and "OS(=O)(=O)CF(F)(F)C 0.0". This rule is supported by research showing that sulfonyl groups can disrupt cellular processes such as oxidative phosphorylation and ion transport across membranes.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene (-C=C-), it may also have toxic effects as seen in SMILES strings "CCCC1CCCC(=O)O1 0.0" and "C=CCOCC(O)CCl 0.0". This rule is supported by research showing that compounds containing this functional group can form reactive intermediates that can damage DNA and other macromolecules.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have toxic effects as seen in SMILES strings "CN(C(=O)CO)c1c(I)c(C(=O)N

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
1. If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as chlorine (-Cl), it may have toxic effects due to their ability to disrupt cellular processes by interacting with proteins and other molecules within cells. Therefore, these functional groups should be avoided when designing new drugs.
2. Molecules containing sulfur atoms tend to have higher toxicity compared to those without them. This is because sulfur can form strong covalent bonds with other molecules, which can lead to irreversible changes in protein structure and function.
3. The presence of conjugated double bonds between carbon atoms can increase the reactivity of a molecule, making it more likely to interact with other molecules and potentially cause harm. Therefore, molecules with highly conjugated systems should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a bromine atom, then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the presence of molecules such as BrC(Br)Br and C=C(C)[C@H]1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1 which have a bromine atom and have been labeled as having toxic effects. However, this rule alone may not be sufficient to accurately predict all cases of toxicity since there are other factors that can contribute to toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), then it is also likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the presence of molecules such as CC(C)(C)C(=O)CCl and O=C1CCC(=O)O1 which have a carbonyl group and have been labeled as having toxic effects. Again, however, this rule alone may not be sufficient to accurately predict all cases of toxicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, then it is more likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the presence of molecules such as CCC(O)OC(O)CC and OC[C@H]1O[C@@H](n2cnc3c(O)ncnc32)[C@H](O)[C@@H]1O

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic effects and should have a high score for toxicity activity (label 1). This rule applies to molecules like O=[N+]([O-])c1ccc(Cl)cc1, CC1(C)[C@@H](OC(=O)CCC(=O)[O-])CC[C@@]2(C)[C@H]1CC[C@]1(C)[C@@H]2C(=O)C=C2[C@@H]3C[C@@](C)(C(=O)[O-])CC[C@]3(C)CC[C@]21C, CN1C(=O)CC(=O)N(c2ccccc2)c2cc(Cl)ccc21, Cc1cc([N+](=O)[O-])c(O)c([N+](=O)[O-])c1, NC(N)=O.OO, CCC(C)(C)c1ccc(O)c(C(C)(C)CC)c1, NCCC[C@H](N)C(=O)O, CNC(=S)NC, COc1ccc2[nH]

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), then it is more likely to have toxic effects than molecules without this functional group. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is highly likely to have toxic effects regardless of other structural features. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br), then it is less likely to have toxic effects compared to molecules without these atoms. This rule applies to molecules labeled as either 0 or 1.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have toxic effects as seen in the first two molecules listed where they contain this functional group but have different structures. However, this rule alone cannot accurately determine if a molecule will have toxic effects since other factors such as concentration, exposure time, and environmental conditions also play a role.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have toxic effects as seen in the third molecule listed which contains this functional group. Again, this rule alone cannot accurately determine if a molecule will have toxic effects since other factors such as concentration, exposure time, and environmental conditions also play a role.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a metal ion such as zinc, it may have toxic effects as seen in the sixth molecule listed which contains a zinc ion. This rule suggests that metals may contribute to the toxicity of certain compounds by disrupting cellular processes or causing oxidative damage.
It's important to note that these rules are just suggestions and should not be used as the sole basis for predicting toxicity without further testing and analysis.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a bromine atom, then it is likely to have toxic effects (label 1). This rule applies to molecules like BrCC(Br)C1CCC(Br)C(Br)C1 and Oc1c(Br)cc(Br)cc1Br.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), then it may have toxic effects (label 1). This rule applies to molecules like NCCOS(=O)(=O)O and Cc1ccc(OC(=O)CC(C)C)cc1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), then it may have toxic effects (label 1). This rule applies to molecules like Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 and O=[N+]([O-])CCO.
It's important to note that these rules are just educated guesses based on limited data and should be validated using larger datasets before being applied to real-world scenarios.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label "1.0" for molecules like CN(C)c1ccc(N)cc1 and NCCNCCN. This rule is supported by previous studies showing that compounds containing cyano groups can cause liver damage and other adverse health effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may not have toxic effects as indicated by the label "0.0" for molecules like Nc1cc(S(=O)(=O)O)ccc1S(=O)(=O)O and CCOS(=O)(=O)CCSP(=O)(OC)OC. However, further research would be needed to confirm this hypothesis since there are also reports of sulfonyl compounds causing adverse reactions.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (-Cl) or bromine (-Br), then it is unlikely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label "0.0" for molecules like Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1 and BrC(Br)C(Br)Br. Halogen atoms are often used in drug design because they can increase the lipophilicity

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a zinc ion (Zn+2), then it is likely to have no toxic effects as indicated by the label 0 for the second molecule in the dataset. This suggests that metal ions may play a role in reducing toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for the last two molecules in the dataset. Sulfonyl groups are commonly found in pesticides and other chemicals that can harm living organisms.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl), then it is likely to have no toxic effects as indicated by the label 0 for several molecules in the dataset including ClC(Cl)(Cl)Br, NCCNC(=O)c1ccc(Cl)cn1, Cc1ccccc1CCl, CC(C)=CC=O, CSc1ccc(C=O)cc1, CCC(C)(C)C(O)CC, OCCN(CCO)c1cccc(Cl)c1, O=C(O)c1cc(O)nc(O)n1, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2)cc1, FC(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(F)(F)Br, O=C(O)

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the first SMILES string labeled as 1. This rule is supported by research showing that sulfonamides can disrupt mitochondrial function and induce oxidative stress, which can lead to cell death.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have toxic effects as suggested by the second and third SMILES strings labeled as 1. Nitro groups can react with cellular components such as proteins and DNA, leading to damage and apoptosis.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene (-C=C-), then it may have toxic effects as shown by the sixth SMILES string labeled as 1. Carbonyl groups can form adducts with nucleophiles such as amino acids and nucleic acid bases, leading to protein and DNA damage. The presence of an adjacent double bond can enhance this reactivity due to increased electron density.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have toxic effects as indicated by the labels "0.0" for O=S(O)CO[Na] and CCOC(=O)CCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC. These functional groups are known to disrupt cellular processes and lead to adverse health outcomes.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a thiocyanate group (-SCN), then it may also have toxic effects as indicated by the label "0.0" for CN(C)C(=S)[S-]. Thiocyanates are known to be highly toxic due to their ability to bind to proteins and enzymes, leading to disruption of cellular functions.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it may have toxic effects as indicated by the labels "0.0" for OC(CCl)CCl and N#CC(Br)Br. Halogen atoms can interfere with cellular processes and lead to oxidative stress and other forms of damage.

Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it may have toxic effects as seen in molecules like CC(C)[N+]1(C)C2CCC1CC(OC(=O)C(CO)c1ccccc1)C2, C=CC(=O)NC(C)(C)CS(=O)(=O)O, O=C(Cl)/C=C/C(=O)Cl, COC(=O)[C@]1(C)CCC[C@]2(C)[C@H]3CCC(C(C)C)=CC3=CC[C@@H]12, etc. Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2), it may also have toxic effects as seen in molecules like CC(C)[N+]1(C)C2CCC1CC(OC(=O)C(CO)c1ccccc1)C2. However, this rule may not apply for all cases since some molecules containing SO2 groups do not show any toxic effects such as in CCCNNC(=O)SCl. Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), it may have toxic effects as seen in molecules like CNC(=O

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it is likely to have toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules like CNC.O=C(O)COc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, CC(O)CCl, CO[C@H]1[C@H]([C@@]2(C)O[C@@H]2CC=C(C)C)[C@]2(CC[C@H]1OC(=O)/C=C/C=C/C=C/C=C/C(=O)O)CO2, O=C(O)[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)C(=O)O, IC(I)I, CCC[C@@H]1O[C@@H]2C[C@H]3[C@@H]4CCC5=CC(=O)C=C[C@]5(C)[C@H]4[C@@H](O)C[C@]3(C)[C@]2(C(=O)CO)O1, C=CC(=O)NC(C)(C)C, CC(C)CNCC(C)C, CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it may have toxic effects as seen in molecules like CC=CC(=O)O, COc1cccc2c1C(=O)c1c(O)c3c(c(O)c1C2=O)C[C@@](O)(C(=O)CO)C[C@@H]3O[C@H]1C[C@H](N)[C@H](O)[C@H](C)O1, Cc1cc2nc3ccc(N(C)C)cc3[s+]c2cc1N, N#Cc1ccccc1C#N, CCCCCCCCCCCCC[N+](C)(C)CCOc1ccccc1, NC[C@@H](O)c2ccc(O)c(NC=O)c2, Oc1cccc2cccnc12, O=C(O)C(=C)C, OC(C)OC(C)=O, CCSc1ccc(Cl)cc1, NCCCSc1ccc(Cl)cc1, NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c(S(N)(=O)=O)c1, CC(C)(C)c1ccc(N)cc1, Nc1cc(C(Cl)=C(Cl)Cl)c(S(N)(=O)=O)cc1S(N)(=O)=O, NNc1ccc(C(

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label "1.0" for the compound "[O-]c1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Sc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1[O-]". Nitro groups are known to be highly reactive and can cause adverse reactions in biological systems.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may also have toxic effects as indicated by the label "1.0" for the compound "CS(=O)NHP(=O)(OP(=O)(OC[C@H]1O[C@H]([C@H]([C@H]1OS(=O)(=O)N1CCSCC1)O)CO)[O-])[O-]" which contains a sulfonamide group. Sulfonyl groups are commonly found in drugs and can cause allergic reactions or other side effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, then it is less likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label "0.0" for the compounds "CC(C)(C#N)/N=N/C(C)(

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the high percentage of molecules labeled as 1 containing this functional group. This rule is supported by research showing that nitro compounds can cause adverse health effects such as methemoglobinemia and liver damage.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine), then it may also have toxic effects due to the ability of these atoms to form reactive radicals that can damage cells. However, this rule is less reliable than Rule 1 since only one out of six molecules labeled as 1 contains a halogen atom.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it is unlikely to have toxic effects because all four molecules labeled as 0 contain this functional group. Sulfonyl groups are commonly found in non-toxic drugs such as aspirin and acetaminophen.
It's important to note that these rules are based on limited data and should be used cautiously when predicting the toxicity of new molecules. It's always best to consult medical literature and conduct further testing before making any decisions about a patient's medication.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a bromine atom, then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the second SMILES string labeled as 1. This rule is based on previous research showing that molecules containing bromine atoms tend to have higher toxicity due to their ability to disrupt cellular processes.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is highly likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the fifth SMILES string labeled as 1. Nitro groups are known to be highly reactive and can cause damage to cells through various mechanisms such as oxidative stress and protein modification.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it is also likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the thirteenth SMILES string labeled as 1. Sulfonamide groups are known to have antibacterial properties but can also cause allergic reactions and other side effects in some individuals.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label "1.0" for the first two molecules containing this functional group.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have toxic effects as indicated by the label "1.0" for the fifth molecule containing this functional group. However, note that there are other factors such as concentration and exposure time that can affect the toxicity of a compound.
Rule 3: If the molecule does not contain either a sulfonyl group or a nitro group but contains multiple chlorine atoms, then it may also have toxic effects as indicated by the label "1.0" for the thirteenth molecule containing four chlorine atoms. This rule is based on the fact that halogenated compounds can disrupt biological systems and can lead to adverse health effects.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of functional groups such as nitro group (-NO2) or halogen atoms like fluorine (-F), chlorine (-Cl), bromine (-Br) and iodine (-I), then the compound has high probability of causing adverse effects. This rule is based on the fact that these functional groups increase the reactivity of the molecules which may lead to toxic effects.
Rule 2: If the molecular weight of the compound is greater than 500 Daltons, then it has higher chances of being toxic. This rule is based on the fact that larger molecules have more surface area available for interaction with other molecules, making them more reactive and potentially harmful.
Rule 3: If the compound contains sulfur (S) or selenium (Se) atom, then it has higher chance of causing adverse effects due to their ability to form covalent bonds with other molecules leading to formation of toxic metabolites.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains iodine atoms, then it is more likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the first two molecules labeled with 1. This may be due to the fact that iodine is known to disrupt cellular processes and increase oxidative stress.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is also more likely to have toxic effects as shown by the sixth molecule labeled with 1. Nitro groups are known to be highly reactive and can cause damage to cells through various mechanisms such as protein modification and DNA damage.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it is less likely to have toxic effects as demonstrated by the last four molecules labeled with 0. Carbonyl groups are common in organic compounds and play important roles in biological systems. However, excessive exposure to carbonyl compounds can lead to negative health outcomes such as respiratory problems and cancer.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it is likely to have toxic effects as seen in molecules like CN(C)C(=O)Ns1ccc(Oc2ccc(F)cc2)cc1 and Ccs1nnc(NS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(Cl)cc2)s1.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom, then it is also likely to have toxic effects as seen in molecules like Nc1cc(C(Cl)=C(Cl)Cl)c(S(N)(=O)=O)cc1S(N)(=O)=O and Oc1ccccc1Cl.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, then it may not necessarily lead to any toxic effects but further analysis would need to be done to confirm this. For example, molecules like CCOS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(C(=O)O)cc1 and CCCCCCCCCCCSCO do not contain a benzene ring yet they still show no signs of toxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have toxic effects as indicated by the first SMILES string labeled as 1. This rule is based on research showing that sulfonyl groups can disrupt cellular processes and lead to toxicity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have toxic effects as indicated by the second SMILES string labeled as 1. This rule is based on research showing that nitro groups can interact with proteins and disrupt their function leading to toxicity.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, it may have toxic effects as indicated by several molecules labeled as 1. This rule is based on research showing that halogens can interfere with biological systems and lead to toxicity.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label "1.0" for molecules NCCN, Nc1nc2c(Cl)cccc2s1, CC(C)(C)c1ccc(O)cc1, COc1ccccc1OCC1CNC(=O)O1, Cc1cccc(C)c1NC(=O)C(C)N, CCCCCCCCCC1CO1, Brc1ccc(Oc2ccccc2)cc1, O=C=Nc1ccc(Cc2ccc(N=C=O)cc2)cc1, CCS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, CS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(Br)cc1, Clc1ccc(C(c2ccccc2Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl)cc1, N=C=ONC(=O)c1ccccc1, c1ccc2c(c1)oc1ccccc12, NCc1cccc(CN)c1, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1nc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, CClc1ccc(C(c2ccccc2Cl)C(Cl)(

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it is likely to have toxic effects (label 1). This rule applies to molecules 5, 7, 8, 9, 16, and 17.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it is unlikely to have toxic effects (label 0). This rule applies to molecules 3 and 4.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) followed by a double bond (=) and another carbonyl group, then it is likely to have toxic effects (label 1). This rule applies to molecule 15.
Note that these rules are just examples and may not apply to all cases. It's important to use caution when making predictions based on limited data.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains bromine atoms, then it is more likely to have toxic effects (label 1) than molecules without bromine atoms (label 0). This rule is supported by the fact that many known toxic compounds contain halogen atoms such as bromine or chlorine.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is also more likely to have toxic effects (label 1) compared to molecules without nitro groups (label 0). Nitro groups are often associated with toxic effects due to their ability to form reactive oxygen species when metabolized in the body.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it is less likely to have toxic effects (label 0) compared to molecules without sulfonyl groups (label 1). Sulfonyl groups are commonly found in non-toxic compounds such as detergents and pharmaceuticals.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have toxic effects as seen in the first SMILES string with a label of 1. This rule is based on research showing that sulfonyl groups can disrupt cellular respiration by inhibiting ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have toxic effects as seen in the second SMILES string with a label of 1. Nitro groups can react with proteins and DNA leading to cell damage and death.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains multiple bromine atoms, it may have toxic effects as seen in the third SMILES string with a label of 1. Bromine is known to disrupt thyroid hormone function which can lead to developmental abnormalities and other health problems.

================================

Based on these data points and their corresponding labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to an aromatic ring, then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the two molecules labeled as 1.0. This rule is based on the fact that cyano groups are known to be toxic and can disrupt cellular processes.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) adjacent to a double bond, then it may also have toxic effects as indicated by one of the molecules labeled as 1.0. Carbonyl groups can react with other molecules and interfere with normal biological functions.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it is unlikely to have toxic effects as indicated by the four molecules labeled as 0.0. Sulfonyl groups are commonly found in non-toxic compounds such as detergents and solvents.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to carbon, then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the labels for molecules such as O=C(O)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 ClCCCl CC(C)Cc1ccc(C(C)C(=O)O)cc1 Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Cl C[C@H](CCC(=O)O)[C@H]1CC[C@H]2[C@@H]3CC[C@@H]4C[C@H](O)CC[C@]4(C)[C@H]3CC[C@@]21C FC(F)OC(F)(F)C(F)Cl COC(=O)C1(O)c2ccccc2-c2ccccc21 N#Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1 FCCCCCCC(C)O NC(=O)C(Cl)Cl FCOCF(Cl)CF(Cl)C CFCCCS(=O)(=O)NN CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC(COP(=O)([O-])OCC[N+](C)(C)C)OC(=O)CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC OC(=O)CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the first SMILES string labeled as 1.0. This rule is supported by research showing that nitro compounds can cause adverse health effects such as methemoglobinemia and liver damage.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as fluorine (-F) or chlorine (-Cl), then it may not have toxic effects as indicated by some of the molecules labeled as 0.0. However, this rule should be taken with caution since other factors such as the position and number of halogens can also affect the toxicity of a molecule.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may not have toxic effects as indicated by several molecules labeled as 0.0. Again, this rule should be taken with caution since the R group can significantly impact the toxicity of the molecule.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the first two molecules labeled with 1. This rule is supported by previous studies showing that compounds containing cyano groups can disrupt cellular respiration and lead to oxidative stress.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have toxic effects as shown by the third molecule labeled with 1. Nitro groups can react with enzymes and proteins leading to their inactivation and disruption of normal cell function.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it is less likely to have toxic effects as demonstrated by the last four molecules labeled with 0. Halogen atoms can increase the lipophilicity of a compound which can enhance its ability to cross biological membranes but may not necessarily indicate toxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label "1.0" for the first two compounds containing this functional group.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene or alkyne group, then it may have toxic effects as seen in the third and fourth compounds respectively.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may also have toxic effects as shown in the last four compounds which contain this functional group.
It's important to note that these rules are just generalizations and should not be used as the sole criteria for predicting toxicity. Other factors such as dosage, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility must also be taken into account when evaluating the safety of a chemical.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have toxic effects as seen in SMILES strings labeled as 1 for CNC(=S)NC, O=C(O)c1cc(Cl)ccc1Cl, COSCC(Br)SBr, CSN(C)C(=O)CH2COOH, CCONHC(=O)NH2, OC(CF3)(FC(F)(F)F)O, FCOC(F)(F)F, FCC(F)(F)OF, CF3CONHCOC(F)(F)F, NCCOSiMe3, N(C)C(C)(C)C(B(F)F)BF3, NC(C)(C)C(C)(C)OB(OH)CF3, CN(C)C(C)(C)C(I)ICF3, S(=O)(=O)c1ccc(Cl)cs1, SC(=O)SCN, SCNC(=O)SCH2SH, SO2NP(=O)(OCC)OC6H5, SCOC(=O)OCH3, SOC7H8NO2SSe, NSC(=O)(=O)C

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label "1" for all compounds containing this functional group. This rule is supported by research showing that nitro groups can cause oxidative stress and damage cells.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may also have toxic effects as indicated by the label "1" for two out of four compounds containing this functional group. Sulfonamides are known to have antimicrobial properties but can also cause allergic reactions and other side effects.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it is less likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label "0" for most compounds containing these atoms. Halogen atoms are often used in drug design to modify chemical properties and improve bioavailability, but they can also increase the risk of adverse effects due to their reactivity.
