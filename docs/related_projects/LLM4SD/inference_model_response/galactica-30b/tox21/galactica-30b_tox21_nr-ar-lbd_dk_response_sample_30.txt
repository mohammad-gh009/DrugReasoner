This rule applies to molecules 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a nitro group (NO2), then it may have toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for those molecules. This rule is supported by research showing that these groups can cause adverse reactions in humans.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (C=C), then it may also have toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for one such molecule in the dataset. This rule is supported by research showing that compounds containing this functional group can react with other molecules to form toxic products.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains chlorine atoms (Cl), then it may have toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for several such molecules in the dataset. However, this rule should be taken with caution since some chlorinated compounds are known to be safe for use in medicine and industry.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three possible rules for predicting if a molecule has toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the NR signaling pathway based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 5, 7, 9, 16, and 28.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains chlorine atoms (-Cl) attached to aromatic rings, then it may have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 11, 13, 14, 15, and 20.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have toxic activity towards the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules 18 and 22.
It's important to note that these rules are just educated guesses based on limited data and should be used with caution. Further research and testing would be needed to confirm their validity.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, it may have potential toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules 2, 6, 7, 9, 18, and 20.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have potential toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules 12 and 13.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it may have potential toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 19.

================================

Based on these data points, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential for causing adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a nitro group (-NO2), it may have toxic activity towards the NR signaling pathway. This is because both groups are known to be highly reactive and can interact with various biological molecules, leading to negative health outcomes. Therefore, compounds containing these functional groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it may also have toxic activity towards the NR signaling pathway. Sulfonyl groups are commonly found in drugs such as sulfonamides, which are known to have adverse effects including hypersensitivity reactions and idiosyncratic toxicities. Therefore, caution should be taken when using compounds containing this functional group.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as bromine or chlorine), it may have high reactivity and potentially cause adverse effects due to its ability to form covalent bonds with other molecules. However, the specific impact of halogens on toxicity depends on several factors such as the position and number of halogen atoms, as well as the overall chemical context of the compound. Therefore, further evaluation would be needed to determine the exact risk associated with each individual case.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential for causing adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a phosphate group (-OPO32-), it may have toxic effects. The two molecules containing these groups in the dataset both have labels of 0.0, indicating no known association with toxicity. However, further research would need to be done to confirm any link between these functional groups and toxicity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-CH=CH-), it may have toxic effects. This rule is supported by the fact that one of the molecules containing such a group in the dataset has a label of 1.0, indicating a known association with toxicity. Further investigation into the specific structural features required for conjugation would need to be conducted before using this as a predictive rule.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have toxic effects. One of the molecules containing a nitro group in the dataset has a label of 1.0, while another has a label of 0.0. Again, more research would need to be done to determine how common a relationship between nitro groups and toxicity is.

This rule suggests that the cyano group may contribute to the toxicity activity of the molecule through some unknown mechanism.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene or alkyne group, it may also have potential toxic effects as indicated by the presence of O=NN1CCCCC1, CCONCCO, COCC1CCC(CO)CC1, CCC(=O)OCCC(C)CCC=C(C)C, CS(=O)(=O)Nc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1Oc1ccccc1, and CCSSCCC with label 1.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential toxic effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have potential toxic effects.

Rule 2: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (C=C), then it may have potential toxic effects. This is because conjugation can increase the reactivity of the C=O bond, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by biological molecules. The second example in the dataset contains a C=O group conjugated with an alkene group and has a label of 0, indicating no apparent toxicity. However, the third example does not contain any conjugated groups but still has a label of 0, suggesting that other factors may contribute to toxicity.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a sulfonate group (SO3-), then it may have potential toxic effects. The sixth example in the dataset contains a sulfonate group and has a label of 0, indicating no apparent toxicity. However, the seventh example contains both a sulfonate group and a benzene ring, which may contribute to toxicity.

This rule applies to molecules 1, 6, 7, 9, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32, 33, 35, 36, 38, 39, 41, 42, 44, 45, 47, 48, 50, 51, 53, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60, 62, 63, 65, 66, 68, 69, 71, 72, 74, 75, 77, 78, 80, 81, 83, 84, 86, 87, 89, 90, 92, 93, 95, 96,

Based on these data points and their corresponding labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has potential for causing adverse effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonate group (-SO3-) or a sulfate group (-OSO3-), it may have toxic activity towards NR signaling pathways involving the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings COC(=O)c1cc(C(=O)OC)cc(S(=O)(=O)[O-])c1 and O=C([O-])CN(CCN(CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-].[Fe+3].
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a conjugated system of double bonds, it may have toxic activity due to its ability to react with other molecules through nucleophilic addition reactions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CCCCC(=O)OCC(=O)[C@H]1[C@H](C)C[C@H]2[C@@H]3C[C@H](F)C4=CC(=O)C=C[C@]4(C)[C@@]3(F)[C@@H](O
