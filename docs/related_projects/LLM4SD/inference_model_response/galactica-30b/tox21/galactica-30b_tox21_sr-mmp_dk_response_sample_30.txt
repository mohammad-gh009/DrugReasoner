Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is more likely to have toxic effects than molecules without this functional group. This is because nitro groups are known to be highly reactive and can interact with other molecules in biological systems, leading to adverse effects. Therefore, any molecule containing a nitro group should be labeled as having toxic effects (label 1).
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it may also have toxic effects due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and react with other molecules. However, this rule is less specific than Rule 1 since there are many different types of carbonyl groups with varying reactivities. Therefore, any molecule containing a carbonyl group should be labeled as potentially having toxic effects (label 0.5).
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it is unlikely to have toxic effects since these groups are often found in non-toxic compounds such as detergents and solvents. Therefore, any molecule containing a sulfonyl group should be labeled as not having toxic effects (label 0).

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label "1.0" for the first two compounds containing this functional group.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene or alkyne group, then it may have toxic effects as seen in the third and fourth compounds respectively.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may also have toxic effects as shown in the last four compounds which contain this functional group.
It's important to note that these rules are just generalizations and should not be used as the sole criteria for predicting toxicity. Other factors such as dosage, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility must also be taken into account when evaluating the safety of a chemical.

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine, bromine or fluorine, then it is likely to have toxic effects. This rule applies to molecules 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77,

Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it is likely to have toxic effects as seen in SMILES strings labeled with 1. This is because nitro groups are known to be highly reactive and can cause damage to cells by oxidizing proteins and DNA.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a mercury atom (Hg) bonded to a carbon atom through a carbonyl group (C=O), it may also have toxic effects as seen in one of the SMILES strings labeled with 1. Mercury is a heavy metal that can disrupt cellular processes and lead to cell death.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl) attached to a carbon atom in a position ortho to a nitrogen atom (N), it is less likely to have toxic effects as seen in some of the SMILES strings labeled with 0.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
1. If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as chlorine (-Cl), it may have toxic effects due to their ability to disrupt cellular processes by interacting with proteins and other molecules within cells. Therefore, these functional groups should be avoided when designing new drugs.
2. Molecules containing sulfur atoms tend to have higher toxicity compared to those without them. This is because sulfur can form strong covalent bonds with other molecules, which can lead to irreversible changes in protein structure and function.
3. The presence of conjugated double bonds between carbon atoms can increase the reactivity of a molecule, making it more likely to interact with other molecules and potentially cause harm. Therefore, molecules with highly conjugated systems should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of functional groups such as nitro group (-NO2) or halogen atoms like fluorine (-F), chlorine (-Cl), bromine (-Br) and iodine (-I), then the compound has high probability of causing adverse effects. This rule is based on the fact that these functional groups increase the reactivity of the molecules which may lead to toxic effects.
Rule 2: If the molecular weight of the compound is greater than 500 Daltons, then it has higher chances of being toxic. This rule is based on the fact that larger molecules have more surface area available for interaction with other molecules, making them more reactive and potentially harmful.
Rule 3: If the compound contains sulfur (S) or selenium (Se) atom, then it has higher chance of causing adverse effects due to their ability to form covalent bonds with other molecules leading to formation of toxic metabolites.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label "1.0" for the compound "[O-]c1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Sc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1[O-]". Nitro groups are known to be highly reactive and can cause adverse reactions in biological systems.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may also have toxic effects as indicated by the label "1.0" for the compound "CS(=O)NHP(=O)(OP(=O)(OC[C@H]1O[C@H]([C@H]([C@H]1OS(=O)(=O)N1CCSCC1)O)CO)[O-])[O-]" which contains a sulfonamide group. Sulfonyl groups are commonly found in drugs and can cause allergic reactions or other side effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, then it is less likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label "0.0" for the compounds "CC(C)(C#N)/N=N/C(C)(

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have toxic effects as indicated by the labels "0.0" for O=S(O)CO[Na] and CCOC(=O)CCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC. These functional groups are known to disrupt cellular processes and lead to adverse health outcomes.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a thiocyanate group (-SCN), then it may also have toxic effects as indicated by the label "0.0" for CN(C)C(=S)[S-]. Thiocyanates are known to be highly toxic due to their ability to bind to proteins and enzymes, leading to disruption of cellular functions.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it may have toxic effects as indicated by the labels "0.0" for OC(CCl)CCl and N#CC(Br)Br. Halogen atoms can interfere with cellular processes and lead to oxidative stress and other forms of damage.

Based on these data points and their corresponding labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to an aromatic ring, then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the two molecules labeled as 1.0. This rule is based on the fact that cyano groups are known to be toxic and can disrupt cellular processes.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) adjacent to a double bond, then it may also have toxic effects as indicated by one of the molecules labeled as 1.0. Carbonyl groups can react with other molecules and interfere with normal biological functions.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it is unlikely to have toxic effects as indicated by the four molecules labeled as 0.0. Sulfonyl groups are commonly found in non-toxic compounds such as detergents and solvents.

However, this rule alone may not be sufficient to accurately predict all cases of toxicity since there are other factors such as concentration, exposure time, and individual susceptibility that also play a role.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it is unlikely to have toxic effects as indicated by the absence of label 1 for molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1. This observation suggests that the sulfonyl group may have a stabilizing effect on the molecule's structure and prevent it from causing any adverse effects.

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains bromine atoms, then it is more likely to have toxic effects (label 1) than molecules without bromine atoms (label 0). This rule is supported by the fact that many known toxic compounds contain halogen atoms such as bromine or chlorine.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is also more likely to have toxic effects (label 1) compared to molecules without nitro groups (label 0). Nitro groups are often associated with toxic effects due to their ability to form reactive oxygen species when metabolized in the body.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it is less likely to have toxic effects (label 0) compared to molecules without sulfonyl groups (label 1). Sulfonyl groups are commonly found in non-toxic compounds such as detergents and pharmaceuticals.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label "1" for all compounds containing this functional group. This rule is supported by research showing that nitro groups can cause oxidative stress and damage cells.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may also have toxic effects as indicated by the label "1" for two out of four compounds containing this functional group. Sulfonamides are known to have antimicrobial properties but can also cause allergic reactions and other side effects.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it is less likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label "0" for most compounds containing these atoms. Halogen atoms are often used in drug design to modify chemical properties and improve bioavailability, but they can also increase the risk of adverse effects due to their reactivity.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic effects as indicated by the first SMILES string labeled as 1.0. This rule is supported by research showing that nitro compounds can cause adverse health effects such as methemoglobinemia and liver damage.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as fluorine (-F) or chlorine (-Cl), then it may not have toxic effects as indicated by some of the molecules labeled as 0.0. However, this rule should be taken with caution since other factors such as the position and number of halogens can also affect the toxicity of a molecule.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may not have toxic effects as indicated by several molecules labeled as 0.0. Again, this rule should be taken with caution since the R group can significantly impact the toxicity of the molecule.

This rule suggests that the presence of halogen atoms like chlorine may increase the likelihood of toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom bonded to two carbon atoms and no other heteroatoms, then it is unlikely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label 0 for molecules like S=C=S and C#CC(C)(O)CC(C)C. This rule suggests that the presence of only sulfur atoms without any other heteroatoms may not lead to toxicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to one carbon atom and another oxygen atom, then it is also unlikely to have toxic effects as indicated by the label 0 for molecules like CCOSSC(CCO)=C(C)N(C=O)Cc1cnc(C)nc1N and CCC(C(=O)OCCN(CC)CC)c1ccccc1. This rule suggests that the presence of both nitrogen and oxygen atoms together may not lead to toxicity.

Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl chloride group (-SO2Cl), it may have toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for ClSC(Cl)(Cl)Cl. However, this rule alone cannot accurately predict all cases of toxicity since there are other molecules without sulfonyl chloride groups that also have toxic effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for CC(=O)N(O)CCCCCNC(=O)CCC(=O)N(O)CCCCCNC(=O)CCC(=O)N(O)CCCCCN. This rule is supported by previous studies showing that nitro compounds can cause adverse health effects such as cancer and birth defects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), it may have toxic effects as indicated by the label 1 for CNC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1. Cyano compounds are known to be highly reactive and can cause damage to DNA and other cellular components.
It's important to note that these rules are just generalizations and should not be used as the sole basis for predicting toxicity. Other factors such as dose, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility must also be considered when evaluating the safety of a chemical.
