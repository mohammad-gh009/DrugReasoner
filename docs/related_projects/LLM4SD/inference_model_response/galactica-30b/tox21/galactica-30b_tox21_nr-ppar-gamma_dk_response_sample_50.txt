Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) followed by a double bond (=), then it is likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to molecules 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards NR signaling pathways involving peroxisomal proliferation receptors. This rule applies to molecules like Clc1nc2ccccc2nc1Cl and Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cc1cc(Cl)ccc1O.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), then it may have toxic activity due to its ability to bind to proteins and disrupt their function. This rule applies to molecules like CCOS(=O)(=O)NN and CCOC(=O)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(Cl)scc1.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), then it may also have toxic activity as it can react with other molecules and form reactive oxygen species which can damage cells. This rule applies to molecules like CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1 and O=[N+]([O-])c1ccc(F)c(Cl)c1.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards PPAR receptors based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (represented by the functional group CCC(=O)O or C=O), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This rule applies to molecules 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine (represented by Cl or Br), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This rule applies to molecules 2, 3, 4, and 22.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (represented by O=S(=O)(O-)), then it may have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This rule applies to molecule 23.
It's important to note that these rules are based on a limited set of data and should be used cautiously when predicting the toxicity of new molecules. Further research and testing would be needed to validate their accuracy and reliability.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains bromine atoms, it may have toxic activity as indicated by the first SMILES string labeled as 1. This rule suggests that molecules containing halogen atoms like bromine might have higher chances of causing adverse effects due to their ability to interact with biological systems.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), it may also have toxic activity as suggested by the second SMILES string labeled as 1. Cyano groups are known to be highly reactive and can form covalent bonds with other molecules, which can lead to harmful reactions.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it may not have toxic activity as shown by the last two SMILES strings labeled as 0. Sulfonyl groups are commonly found in drugs and are considered safe for human use. However, this rule should be taken with caution since there are cases where sulfonyl groups can cause allergic reactions or other side effects.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains bromine atoms, then it is likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies only to two molecules in the dataset, which both contain bromine atoms and have labels of 1. However, there are other molecules without bromine atoms that also have toxic activity, so this rule should be considered as one factor among others when predicting toxicity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it is likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to one molecule in the dataset, which contains a cyano group and has a label of 1. Again, this rule should be considered as one factor among others when predicting toxicity.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity (label 0). This rule applies to four molecules in the dataset, all of which contain a sulfonamide group but have different labels (one with label 0 and three with label 1). Therefore, while this rule may provide some information about the relationship between the presence of a sulfonamide group and toxicity, it cannot be used as a definitive predictor.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it is likely to have toxic activity against the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor in the NR signaling pathway. This rule applies to molecules like CC(=O)OCC(=O)[C@@]1(O)CC[C@H]2[C@@H]3CCC4=CC(=O)C=C[C@]4(C)[C@@]3(F)[C@@H](O)C[C@@]21C which has a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and has been labeled as having toxic activity (label 1).
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a thiomethyl group (-SCH3), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity. This rule applies to molecules like Cc1ccc(S)cc1 which does not contain a thiomethyl group but has been labeled as non-toxic (label 0).
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl), then it may have toxic activity. This rule applies to molecules like O=C(Cl)c1cc(C(=O)Cl)cc(C(=O)Cl)c1 which contains a chlorine atom and has been labeled

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards PPAR receptors based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) or a carboxylic acid group (COOH), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This rule applies to molecules like CC(C)CCOC(=O)C=Cc1ccccc1, CC(=O)OCc1ccccc1, Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, CNC(=O)Oc1c(C(C)(C)C)cc(C)cc1C(C)(C)C, O=C1NC(=O)[C@@]2(CCOc3ccc(F)cc32)N1, NCCN1CCOCC1, CCCc1c(OCCCOc2ccc(OCC(=O)O)cc2)ccc(C(C)=O)c1O, CNC(=O)NNc1ccccc1, NC(=O)CNNc1ccccc1, CCOC(=O)COc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, CCN(CC)CSSCC(=O)NS(=O)(=O)NSC(=O)(=O)NCC, CCSCCC(CC)COC(=O)COc1ccc(Cl)cc1

================================

Rule 1: The presence of bromine atoms and chlorine atoms in a compound increases its likelihood of being toxic as they are known to disrupt biological processes. Therefore, compounds containing these elements should be labeled as 1 if they have any potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: Compounds containing functional groups such as carbonyl groups or nitro groups may also increase their chances of being toxic due to their ability to interact with proteins and other molecules within cells. Therefore, compounds containing these functional groups should also be labeled as 1 if they have any potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: Compounds containing sulfur atoms may also increase their chance of being toxic because of their ability to form covalent bonds with other molecules. However, this rule is less specific than Rules 1 and 2 since there are many different types of sulfur-containing compounds with varying levels of toxicity. Therefore, this rule should only be used as a general guideline and not relied upon exclusively.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it may have toxic activity towards the NR signaling pathway. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has a label of 1, indicating toxic activity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have toxic activity towards the NR signaling pathway. However, the second molecule in the dataset does not contain this functional group but still has a label of 1, suggesting there may be other factors involved in determining toxicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a bromine atom (Br), then it may have toxic activity towards the NR signaling pathway. The third molecule in the dataset contains this element and has a label of 1, supporting this rule.

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity towards PPAR receptors in NR signalling pathways:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors in NR signalling pathways. This rule applies to molecules like CC1(C)S[C@@H]2[C@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](c3ccccc3)S(=O)(=O)[O-])C(=O)N2[C@H]1C(=O)[O-] and CN(C1CCCCC1)S(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1N. These functional groups are known to interact with PPAR receptors and cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains bromine atoms, then it is also likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors in NR signalling pathways. This rule applies to molecules like COc1cccc(Br)c1 and C=CC/C=C/C. Bromine atoms can increase the lipophilicity of a molecule, which can enhance its ability to bind to PPAR receptors and cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a phosphate group (-OPO3R2), then it may not have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors in NR signalling pathways. This rule applies to

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) followed by a double bond (C=X) where X is any atom except for carbon, then it is likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to molecules 1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77,

Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with another double bond, then it may have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This rule applies to molecules like O=C(c1ccc(O)cc1)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 and CO[C@H]1O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H]1O.

Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with another double bond, such as in COc1ccc(OS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(Br)cc2)cc1, then it may also have toxic activity against the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor in the NR signaling pathway.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), such as in CCOC(=O)OCS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(I)cc1, then it may have toxic activity due to its ability to bind to proteins and disrupt their function. However, this rule should be used cautiously since there may be other factors involved in determining toxicity.

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards PPAR receptors based on its structure and properties:
1. If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as chlorine (-Cl), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors (label 1). This is because these functional groups are known to interact with PPAR receptors and affect their function.
2. If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors (label 0). Sulfonyl groups are often found in drugs that target other proteins and do not interfere with PPAR receptors.
3. If the molecule contains a long chain of carbon atoms without any functional groups, then it is also unlikely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors (label 0). These molecules may simply not bind well to PPAR receptors due to their size and shape.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic activity (label 1). This rule applies to molecules 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68,

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards PPAR receptors based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a nitrate group (-ONO2), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This is because these groups are known to interact with PPAR receptors and cause adverse effects. The molecules containing such groups in the provided dataset all have labels of 1, indicating their ability to bind to PPAR receptors and cause toxicity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-CH=CH-), then it may also have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This is because such structures are similar to natural ligands of PPAR receptors, which contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) conjugated with an alkene group. Therefore, they may mimic the action of natural ligands and activate PPAR receptors, leading to adverse effects. However, this rule should be used cautiously as it is based on limited data and may not apply to all cases.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may not have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This is because sulfonamides are commonly used as antibiotics and do not typically interact with PPAR receptors. None of the molecules containing sulfonamide groups in the provided dataset had toxic activity towards PPAR receptors.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a bromine atom, it is likely to have toxic activity as indicated by the presence of five molecules containing bromine out of six labeled as having toxic activity. However, this rule alone may not be sufficient since there are also four molecules without bromine atoms but still labeled as having toxic activity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), it is more likely to have toxic activity as indicated by the presence of seven molecules containing at least one carbonyl group among those labeled as having toxic activity. This rule is supported by the fact that many toxic compounds contain functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids which all contain a carbonyl group.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a long chain of carbon atoms, it is less likely to have toxic activity as indicated by the absence of any molecules with a long chain of carbon atoms among those labeled as having toxic activity. This rule is supported by the fact that most small molecules tend to be more toxic than larger ones due to their higher reactivity and ability to penetrate cell membranes.

It's important to note that these rules are based on a limited set of examples and should be used cautiously when predicting the toxicity of new molecules. It's always best to consult with experts in the field for accurate predictions.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it may have toxic activity towards NR signaling pathways involving peroxisomal proliferation. This rule applies to molecules like NC(=O)OC[C@@H]1[C@H](NC(=O)/C(=N\OCC(=O)[O-])c2csc(N)n2)C(=O)N1S(=O)(=O)[O-] and CC(=O)Oc1cccc(C(=O)O)c1OC(C)=O.

================================

Based on these data points and their corresponding labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have toxic effects as seen in molecules like CC(Cc1ccc(C(C)(C)C)cc1)CN1C[C@H](C)O[C@H](C)C1 and C[N+]1([O-])[C@H]2C[C@H](OC(=O)[C@H](CO)c3ccccc3)C[C@@H]1[C@H]1O[C@@H]21.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards PPAR receptors based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This is because these functional groups are known to interact with PPAR receptors and cause adverse effects. For example, the compound CCCn1cc[n+](C)c1C contains a cyano group and has a label of 0.0, which indicates no toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. On the other hand, the compound C[N+](C)(C)Cc1ccccc1 also contains a cyano group but has a label of 1.0, indicating toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. Therefore, while the presence of a cyano group may indicate potential toxicity, it is not a definitive predictor by itself.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), then it is less likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This is because halogens are often used to modify the physical and chemical properties of molecules without significantly altering their biological activity. For instance, the compounds COOP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl and CNCc1cc(F)ccc1Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 both contain

Based on these data points and their corresponding labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have toxic effects. The first four molecules listed contain either a nitro or sulfonyl group, so they all have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene or alkyne, then it may also have toxic effects. This rule applies to the sixth and seventh molecules listed.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, then it may also have toxic effects. This rule applies to the eleventh and twelfth molecules listed.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited data provided and should be used cautiously when predicting the toxicity of new molecules. It's always best to consult with a qualified chemist before making any decisions about the safety of a particular compound.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three possible rules for predicting if a given molecule has toxic activity towards PPAR receptors based on its structure and properties:

Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group connected to a benzene ring, then it may have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This rule applies to the eleventh molecule in the dataset.
It's important to note that these rules are just educated guesses based on limited data and should be used with caution. Further research and testing would be needed to confirm their validity.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic activity or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have toxic activity towards NR signaling pathways involving peroxisomal proliferation. This rule applies to molecules such as O=NN([O-])c1ccccc1 and C[N+](C)(C)CC(O)CCl.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), it may also have toxic activity towards NR signaling pathways involving peroxisomal proliferation. This rule applies to molecules such as CCOC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(C)=C(C(=O)OC)C1c1cccc(Cl)c1Cl and COC(C)(C)C.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine), it may have toxic activity due to its ability to disrupt protein-ligand interactions within biological systems. This rule applies to molecules such as c1ccc2[nH]cnc2c1, CCCP(=S)(OCC)SCSc1cc(Cl)ccc1Cl, and Oc1ccc(-c2ccccc2)c(Cl)c1.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards PPAR receptors based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains bromine atoms, it is more likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors as compared to molecules without bromine atoms. This rule is supported by the fact that many known PPAR agonists contain halogen atoms such as chlorine or bromine.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) conjugated with a double bond (C=C), it is less likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This rule is supported by the fact that unsaturated fatty acids like linoleic acid do not activate PPAR receptors but their oxidized derivatives containing a conjugated diene system do.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), it is unlikely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This rule is supported by the fact that nitro compounds are often associated with toxicity due to their ability to form reactive intermediates during metabolism.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards PPAR receptors based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) or a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), then it is likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors. This rule applies to molecules 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has toxic effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have toxic effects as seen in the second SMILES string where the molecule contains a nitro group but does not have any other functional groups that would suggest no toxicity. However, this rule alone cannot guarantee safety since there might be other factors such as dosage, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility that play a role in determining the overall toxicity of a compound.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a phosphate group (-PO4), it may also have toxic effects as seen in the fifth SMILES string where the molecule contains both a phosphate group and a halogenated alkyl group which suggests potential for toxicity. Again, this rule alone cannot guarantee safety either.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains multiple aromatic rings connected by conjugated double bonds, it may have toxic effects as seen in the thirteenth SMILES string where the molecule contains two phenyl rings connected by a vinyl group. This type of structure is often associated with carcinogenicity due to the ability of these molecules to form DNA adducts and induce mutations.

================================

Based on this small dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a given molecule has toxic activity towards PPAR receptors based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a bromine atom, then it is likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors (label 1). This rule applies only to one molecule in the dataset, which has a bromine atom and a label of 1. However, since there are no other molecules in the dataset with similar structures or properties, we cannot make any strong conclusions about this rule's accuracy or generalizability.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is also likely to have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors (label 1). This rule applies to two molecules in the dataset, both of which have labels of 1. Nitro groups are known to be highly reactive and can interact with biological systems in various ways, so it is not surprising that they might affect PPAR receptors. Again, however, this rule should be considered tentative until more data becomes available.
Rule 3: If the molecule does not contain either a bromine atom nor a nitro group but has a high number of rotatable bonds (>5), then it may not have toxic activity towards PPAR receptors (label 0). This rule applies to four molecules in the dataset, all of which have low numbers of rotatable bonds (<5) and labels of 0. Rotatable bonds allow for flexibility in molecular structure, which can impact how a molecule interacts with biological
