Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a phosphorus atom bonded to two carbon atoms in a ring, then it may have potential side effects associated with infections and infestations. The presence of this functional group suggests that the compound could interact with biological molecules such as DNA or proteins, leading to negative health outcomes.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a sulfur atom bonded to one oxygen atom and one carbon atom, then it may also have potential side effects associated with infections and infestations. This functional group is commonly found in antibiotics like penicillin and other antimicrobial agents. It is likely that these compounds interfere with the growth and reproduction of bacteria by disrupting their cell walls or membranes.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a gold atom, then it may be toxic due to its ability to bind to thiol groups on proteins and enzymes, causing them to malfunction. This property has been exploited in cancer therapy, where gold-based drugs are used to target and destroy cancerous cells. However, exposure to high levels of gold can also lead to serious health problems such as kidney damage and neurological disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have side effects related to infections and infestations. The first example in the dataset contains both groups and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to a double bond, then it is also likely to have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule is based on the second example in the dataset which contains this structural feature and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to a nitrogen atom through two single bonds, then it may not have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule is based on the last example in the dataset which does not contain any of the other features mentioned above but still has been labeled as not having these side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the functional group C(CS(=O)(=O)O)S or CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C3(C(CC2(C1(C(=O)CO)O)C)O)F)C, then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the functional group [H+].[H+].[H+].CC1=NC=C(C(=C1[O-])CN(CCN(CC2=C(C(=NC=C2COP(=O)([O-])[O-])C)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])COP(=O)([O-])[O-].[Na+].[Na+].[Na+].[Mn+2], then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains the functional group CCCN1CCN(CC1)C2=CC=C(C=C2)OCC3COC(O3)(CN4C=NC=N4)C5=C(C=C(C=C5)Cl)Cl,

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects. The presence of this functional group can increase the reactivity of the molecule and interact with other molecules or tissues in the body, leading to potential toxicity. Therefore, molecules containing nitro groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, especially if it is substituted with electron-withdrawing groups such as -COOH, -CHO, or -NO2, it may also have adverse effects. These substituents can increase the reactivity of the aromatic ring and make it more susceptible to oxidation or reduction reactions, which can lead to toxic effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule has a long carbon chain or multiple rings, it may have poor solubility in water and may accumulate in the body over time, leading to potential toxicity. Therefore, molecules with these structural features should be used cautiously or avoided altogether.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have side effects associated with infections and infestations. The given SMILES string for compound number 6 has this functional group and therefore has been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a conjugated system of double bonds, such as in compound numbers 7 and 8, then it may be more likely to have side effects due to its reactivity. However, this rule alone cannot accurately predict if the molecule will have any specific side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a halogen atom, such as chlorine or fluorine, attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group, such as in compounds 9 and 10, then it may have side effects associated with infections and infestations. This is because halogens can increase the reactivity of molecules and potentially interact with biological systems.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have side effects related to infections and infestations. The second molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains both a sulfonamide group and a nitro group, then it is more likely to have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule combines Rules 1 and 2 by adding another structural feature that is associated with these side effects. All molecules containing both groups have been labeled as having such side effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects. For example, molecules containing nitro groups or halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine have been known to exhibit toxic or carcinogenic properties. Therefore, if a molecule contains these functional groups, it should be labeled as having a high likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: The structure of a molecule plays a crucial role in determining its biological activity. A molecule's shape, size, and polarity can affect how it interacts with other molecules within the body. For instance, molecules with a planar structure tend to be more lipophilic and can cross cell membranes easily, leading to increased bioavailability and toxicity. On the other hand, molecules with a non-planar structure may be less likely to penetrate cells and cause adverse effects. Therefore, if a molecule has a highly polar or non-planar structure, it may be less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: The molecular weight of a compound can also influence its ability to cause adverse effects. Generally, larger molecules tend to be more hydrophobic and can accumulate in tissues, leading to toxicity. However, there is no specific cut-off value for molecular weight above which a substance becomes toxic. Therefore, this rule should be used cautiously when predicting the potential adverse effects of a molecule based on its molecular weight.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a compound increases its chances of causing adverse effects. This rule applies to compounds 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 12

Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a gold atom, then it may be toxic due to its ability to bind to thiol groups on proteins and enzymes, causing them to malfunction. This property has been exploited in cancer therapy, where gold-based drugs are used to target and destroy cancerous cells. However, exposure to high levels of gold can also lead to serious health problems such as kidney damage and neurological disorders.

Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 in the dataset.

Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have side effects related to infections and infestations. The second molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains both a sulfonamide group and a nitro group, then it is more likely to have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule combines Rules 1 and 2 by adding another structural feature that is associated with these side effects. All molecules containing both groups have been labeled as having such side effects.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as "-NO2" or "-COOH", then it has the potential to cause adverse effects in humans. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, the first molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) which may cause allergic reactions or other health issues if ingested or inhaled.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring, then it also has the potential to cause adverse effects in humans. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the given dataset.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a guanidine group (-CNHC(=NH)NH-), then it may have potential side effects associated with infections and infestations. The presence of these groups in the chemical structure indicates that the compound has antimicrobial properties which can be beneficial for treating bacterial infections but can also lead to adverse reactions such as hypersensitivity reactions or skin rashes.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains two positively charged phosphorus atoms connected by a single bond, then it may have potential side effects associated with infections and infestations. This type of structure is commonly found in organophosphorus compounds which are known to have insecticidal and fungicidal properties. However, exposure to high levels of these compounds can cause adverse health effects such as respiratory distress, seizures, and even death.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (-C=O) through a double bond, then it may not have any significant side effects associated with infections and infestations. This type of structure is commonly found in flavonoids, a class of plant compounds that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (represented by the SMILES string "SO2NH" or "R-SO2NR'" where R and R' are any organic groups), then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular formula contains iron atoms or calcium ions, then it has no relation to infection and infestation activities.
Explanation: Iron and calcium ions do not have any direct impact on infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites etc. Therefore, molecules containing these elements cannot be associated with such activities.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) in its structure, then it may have some potential for causing adverse effects related to infections and infestations.
Explanation: Nitro groups are known to exhibit antimicrobial properties due to their ability to disrupt cellular respiration processes in microorganisms. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group could potentially possess anti-infective properties. However, further research would be required to confirm this hypothesis.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom, then it may also have some potential for causing adverse effects related to infections and infestations.
Explanation: Fluorine atoms are known to increase the lipophilicity of organic compounds, which can enhance their ability to penetrate cell membranes and interact with intracellular targets. Therefore, molecules containing fluorinated substituents could potentially possess enhanced biological activity against pathogens. Again, further research would be required to confirm this hypothesis.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects. The presence of this functional group can increase the reactivity of the molecule and interact with other molecules or tissues in the body, leading to potential toxicity. Therefore, molecules containing nitro groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, especially if it is substituted with electron-withdrawing groups such as -COOH, -CHO, or -NO2, it may also have adverse effects.
