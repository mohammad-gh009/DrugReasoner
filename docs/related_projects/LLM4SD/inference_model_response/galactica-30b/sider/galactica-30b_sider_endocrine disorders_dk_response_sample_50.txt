Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C[C@@H]1C2C(C(=O)N2C(=C1S[C@H]3C[C@H](NC3)C(=O)N(C)C)C(=O)O)[C@H](C)O.O.O.O 0 and CC[C@H](C)[C@H]1C(=O)NC(C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@@H](CSSCCC(=O)N[C@@H](C(=O)N1)CC2=CC=C(C=C2)OCC)C(=O)N3CCC[C@H]3C(=O)N[C@@H](CCCN)C(=O)NCC(=O)N)CC(=O)N)[C@@H](C)O 0.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have potential side effects related

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like sulfonamide or nitro group in the structure of a molecule, then it may have potential to cause adverse effects on human health due to its ability to inhibit enzymes involved in various metabolic processes. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: Molecules having aromatic rings and halogen atoms such as fluorine, chlorine etc. may also pose some risk for causing adverse effects because they can interact with biological macromolecules leading to changes in their function. Hence, it is advisable to avoid using them in drug design unless necessary.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure play a significant role in determining its toxicity. Longer chains and more complex structures tend to increase the likelihood of unwanted interactions within the body. Therefore, it is important to keep the molecular size and complexity under control while designing new drugs.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three possible rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a similar functional group, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the first molecule listed above contains a sulfonamide group and was labeled as "1".
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group (-C=O) through a single bond, then it may not have side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" in the dataset. For example, the second molecule listed above contains such a structure and was labeled as "0".
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a guanidine group (-C(NH2)=NNHC(=O)) or a similar functional group, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the third molecule listed above contains a guanidine group and was labeled as "1".

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a functional group such as carbonyl or carboxyl in the structure of a molecule, then it may have potential side effects on endocrine disorders. The presence of these groups indicates that the compound could be metabolized into active compounds which might interfere with hormone production and regulation. For example, in the first SMILES string, the molecule contains both ketone and ester groups, which suggests that it has the potential to interact with hormones involved in endocrine function.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a heterocyclic ring system, especially nitrogen-containing rings like pyridine or pyrimidine, it may also exhibit endocrine disrupting activities. These types of structures are often found in pharmaceutical drugs and can bind to receptors in the body, potentially interfering with normal hormonal signaling pathways. For instance, in the second SMILES string, the molecule contains a benzimidazole ring, which is known for its biological activity and medicinal applications.
Rule 3: Molecules containing halogen atoms, particularly chlorine or bromine, may have higher probabilities of causing adverse effects due to their ability to disrupt protein-ligand interactions within the body. Halogenated compounds are commonly used in industrial processes and can accumulate in the environment, leading to potential health risks. For example, in the sixth SMILES string, the molecule contains two chlorine atoms, which may increase its likelihood of interacting with proteins involved in endocrine function.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The first example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains both groups. However, note that this rule alone cannot guarantee that the molecule will have such side effects since other factors like dosage, metabolism, and individual susceptibility also play a role.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a double bond between two carbon atoms, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The second example in the dataset satisfies this rule but again, this rule alone does not guarantee that the molecule will have such side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (-C6H5) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in its structure, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The third example in the dataset satisfies this rule but once again, this rule alone does not guarantee that the molecule will have such side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels of 0 indicating no known association with endocrine disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (-C=O) through a single bond, then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This structural feature appears in the third molecule in the dataset which also has a label of 0.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to four other atoms including one carbon atom, then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This structural feature appears in the fourth molecule in the dataset which also has a label of 0.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided by the given dataset and should be treated as preliminary suggestions only. Further research and analysis would be needed to confirm their validity and applicability to a wider range of compounds and conditions.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to endocrine disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a benzene ring (-C6H5), then it is more likely to have side-effects related to endocrine disorders. This is based on the fact that molecules containing these functional groups appear in both labeled compounds (with labels 1 and 0) but not in any unlabeled ones. However, this rule alone may not be sufficient to make accurate predictions since there are also other labeled compounds without these functional groups.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a pyridine ring (-C5H5N), then it is less likely to have side-effects related to endocrine disorders. This is based on the fact that none of the labeled compounds contain both of these functional groups. Therefore, if a new compound contains both of these functional groups, it is less likely to have side-effects related to endocrine disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) and a phenyl group (-C6H5), then it is more likely to have side-effects related to endocrine disorders. This is based on the fact that all four labeled compounds containing a sulfonyl group also contain a phenyl group. Therefore, if a new compound contains only one of these functional groups, it is less likely to have side-effects related to endocrine disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. The presence of this functional group in certain drugs such as glipizide and glyburide has been linked to increased risk of hypoglycemia and other endocrine-related complications.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. Nitro compounds are known to interfere with hormone production and metabolism, which can lead to various health problems including thyroid dysfunction and diabetes.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it may also have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. Cyano compounds have been shown to disrupt hormonal balance and affect glucose metabolism, leading to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a cyano group (-CN) and a sulfonamide group (-SO2NR2), then it may have potential side effects associated with endocrine disorders. The presence of these functional groups in the chemical compound suggests that it could interfere with hormone production or function, leading to hormonal imbalances and potentially harmful health consequences.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a conjugated system of double bonds between two aromatic rings, such as in the case of coumarin derivatives, then it may also exhibit endocrine disrupting activities. Coumarins are known to bind to estrogen receptors and disrupt normal estrogenic signaling pathways, leading to reproductive abnormalities and other health problems.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may be potentially toxic and carcinogenic due to its ability to form DNA adducts and induce mutations. Nitro compounds are known to be potent mutagens and carcinogens, and their exposure has been linked to various types of cancer in humans.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules such as C(C(CO)O)O, COC1=C2C(=CC(=C1N3CC4CCCNC4C3)F)C(=O)C(=CN2C5CC5)C(=O)O, CCC(C)CCCCC(=O)NC(CCN)C(=O)NC(C(C)O)C(=O)NC(CCN)C(=O)NC1CCNC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC1=O)CCN)CC2=CC=CC=C2)CC(C)C)CCN)CCN)C(C)O, CC(C)(C)C(=O)OCOP(=O)(COCCN1C=NC2=C1N=CN=C2N)OCOC(=O)C(C)(C)C, CCSSCC(C(=O)NP(=O)(OP1(=O)

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a similar functional group, it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules #9, #10, and #11 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a similar functional group, it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules #12 and #13 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine attached to a carbon atom, it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules #14 and #15 in the dataset.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
1. If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having potential side effects.
2. If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may also have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. The second molecule in the dataset contains this structural feature and has been labeled as having potential side effects.
3. If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may also have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains this structural feature and has been labeled as having potential side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group through a single bond, then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a double bond, then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to a nitrogen atom, then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group (-C=O) through a single bond, then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1

================================

Rule 1: The presence of sulfur in a compound increases its likelihood of causing endocrine disorders as seen in the second and third molecules listed above. Sulfur is known for its ability to form strong bonds with other atoms, which can affect the structure and function of proteins involved in hormonal regulation.
Rule 2: A compound containing chlorine may also increase the risk of endocrine disruption due to its ability to interfere with hormone signaling pathways. This is evident in the fifth molecule listed where the presence of two sodium ions suggests that this compound may be highly polar and able to interact strongly with biological systems.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule's carbon chain can also play a role in determining its potential to disrupt endocrine functions. Longer chains tend to make compounds more hydrophobic, which can facilitate their interaction with lipid-based hormones such as steroids. Additionally, branching or cyclization of a molecule can alter its shape and flexibility, potentially affecting its ability to bind to target receptors.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom and a benzene ring, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset meet this criterion and have labels of 1, indicating they do have such side effects. However, there are also other molecules in the dataset without these features but still having labels of 1, so this rule alone cannot accurately predict all cases.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom and a thiazole ring, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The third molecule in the dataset meets this criterion and has a label of 1, indicating it does have such side effects. Again, this rule alone cannot accurately predict all cases.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring and a carbonyl group, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule is based on the fourth and fifth molecules in the dataset, which both contain a pyrimidine ring and a ketone group, respectively, and have labels of 1. While this rule may be more specific than the previous ones, it still cannot accurately predict all cases either since some molecules with similar structures have different labels.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a thiocarbonyl group (=S) in conjugation with a double bond or aromatic ring, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the dataset. For example, the first molecule in the dataset contains a thiocarbonyl group conjugated with a double bond and is labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (=O) adjacent to a carbon-carbon double bond, then it may not have side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 0 in the dataset. For example, the second molecule in the dataset contains a carbonyl group adjacent to a carbon-carbon double bond and is labeled as 0.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule also applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the dataset. For example, the third molecule in the dataset contains a cyano group attached to an aromatic ring and is labeled as 1.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a similar functional group, then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. The first molecule in the dataset contains such a group and has been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. The second molecule in the dataset contains such a group and has been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it may also have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains such a group and has been labeled as having potential side effects.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains iodine atoms and has a functional group like -CONHC(=O)- or -COOH, then it may have potential side effects in relation to endocrine disorders. The first example in the given dataset satisfies this rule as it contains two iodine atoms and a -CONHN- functional group.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring and a sulfonyl group, then it may not have any significant side effects associated with endocrine disorders. The third example in the given dataset does not satisfy this rule since it only contains a phenyl ring without any other functional groups.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a cyano group and a carbonyl group, then it may potentially lead to adverse effects due to its ability to bind to receptors in the body. The last example in the given dataset satisfies this rule as it contains both a cyano group and a carbonyl group.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. The first molecule in the dataset contains such a group and has been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. However, this rule should be used cautiously since there are other molecules in the dataset without nitro groups but still labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom (-F) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to the third molecule in the dataset which has been labeled as having potential side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 in the provided dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), then it may also have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a benzene ring or a similar aromatic system, it may have a higher chance of causing endocrine disorders as compared to non-aromatic molecules. This rule is based on the observation that many endocrine disrupting chemicals contain aromatic rings in their structures.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it may also increase the likelihood of having endocrine disruption activities. This rule is based on the fact that carboxylic acids can bind to hormone receptors and disrupt normal hormonal functions.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to at least two other atoms, it may also contribute to increased endocrine disruption activities. This rule is based on the observation that many synthetic hormones and drugs containing nitrogen-containing functional groups have been shown to have endocrine disruptive effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing endocrine disorders as a side effect. For example, the molecule containing the sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) has been known to cause endocrine disruption by mimicking hormones and interfering with their normal function. Therefore, if a molecule contains this or similar functional groups, it should be labeled as having potential for endocrine disorder activity.
Rule 2: The molecular structure and geometry play a significant role in determining the biological activity of a compound. A molecule with a planar structure and rigid conformation may have higher affinity towards specific receptors than one with a flexible structure. Additionally, the length and flexibility of the carbon chain may also affect the interaction between the molecule and its target receptor. Therefore, molecules with such structural features should be considered more likely to exhibit endocrine disrupting activities.
Rule 3: The charge distribution on a molecule affects its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with cellular components. Molecules with polar functional groups like hydroxyl (-OH), carboxyl (-COOH), and amino (-NH2) groups tend to carry a net negative or positive charge depending on the pH of the solution. These charged molecules may have better membrane permeability and binding affinity towards specific targets compared to neutral ones. Therefore, compounds with these types of functional groups should be evaluated carefully for their potential to disrupt hormonal balance.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of iron oxide in the molecular structure, then it may lead to potential toxicity and should be labeled as 1. This rule applies to the second SMILES string provided where two oxygen atoms bonded to one iron atom form iron oxides which could potentially cause harm if ingested or inhaled.
Rule 2: If there is a presence of sulfur in the molecular structure along with nitrogen, then it may indicate potential toxicity and should be labeled as 1. This rule applies to the fifth SMILES string provided where sulfur and nitrogen are present together in the molecular structure forming a thiazole ring which has been associated with various toxic effects such as carcinogenicity and mutagenicity.
Rule 3: If there is a presence of fluorine in the molecular structure, then it may increase the lipophilicity of the compound and make it more likely to cross cell membranes leading to potential toxicity. This rule applies to the eighth SMILES string provided where fluorine is present on a benzene ring which is known for its lipophilic nature and ability to disrupt biological systems.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a platinum ion or a thallium atom, it is likely not associated with endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "[Pt+2]" or "Cl[Tl]" in the dataset. These atoms may have different chemical properties than organic compounds and therefore do not interact with endocrine systems in the same way.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, it is more likely to be associated with endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings containing the substring "ClC" or "CCL" in the dataset. Chlorine is often present in pharmaceuticals as a substituent for other functional groups such as alcohols or amines, which can affect their biological activity. It is possible that these substituents may also influence interactions with endocrine systems.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen-containing ring system, it is less likely to be associated with endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings containing the substrings "N#C" or "N#P" in the dataset. Nitrogen-containing rings are commonly found in drugs and other biologically active compounds, but they may not necessarily be associated with specific types of side effects.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group such as carbonyl or carboxyl in the structure of a molecule, then it may have potential for causing adverse effects on endocrine system. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 and 0. For example, in the first SMILES string, the presence of two carbonyl groups in the structure suggests that this molecule has the potential to interact with biological systems and potentially cause adverse effects if ingested. However, this rule alone cannot determine the exact nature of these effects without further analysis.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains nitrogen atoms bonded to carbon atoms, it may also have potential for causing adverse effects on endocrine system. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 0 and 1. For instance, in the second SMILES string, the presence of a nitrogen atom connected to three other carbon atoms indicates that this molecule could potentially interfere with hormonal regulation and lead to adverse health outcomes. Again, this rule alone does not provide definitive evidence of toxicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine, it may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on endocrine system. This rule can only be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 since none of the molecules labeled as 0 contain any halogens. The third SMILES string represents a chlorinated compound which may pose a risk of toxicity due to its ability to disrupt normal physiological processes. It is important to note that while this rule provides some insight into potential risks associated with certain chemical structures, it should not be used as the sole basis for determining safety or toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a compound may indicate its potential to cause endocrine disorders as seen in the first SMILES string. Sulfonamides are known to interfere with hormone production and can lead to various health problems including thyroid dysfunction, insulin resistance, and obesity.
Rule 2: A compound containing a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring may also have the potential to cause endocrine disorders due to its ability to disrupt hormonal signaling pathways. Nitro compounds are known to interact with estrogen receptors and can lead to reproductive abnormalities such as infertility or birth defects.
Rule 3: Compounds containing conjugated double bonds and carbonyl groups may be more likely to cause adverse effects on the endocrine system compared to those without these functional groups. Conjugated double bonds increase the lipophilicity of a compound which allows for easier penetration into cells and tissues while carbonyl groups can form hydrogen bonds with proteins and enzymes leading to altered function.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a benzene ring (-C6H5), then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The first example in the dataset satisfies this rule.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl) and a pyrimidine ring (-C4H4N2), then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The second example in the dataset satisfies this rule.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a naphthalene ring (-C10H8), then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The third example in the dataset satisfies this rule.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) in its structure, then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings "CCCCC(=O)O[C@@]1(CCC2C1(CC(C3C2CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)O)C)C(=O)CO" and "CN(CC(CO)O)C(=O)C1=C(C(=C(C(=C1I)C(=O)NCC(CO)O)I)NC(=O)COC)I".
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a nitrile group (-CN) in its structure, then it may not have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings "C(CO)N" and "CC(CN1C=NC2=C1N=CN=C2N)OCP(=O)(O)O".
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5) or a naphthalene ring (C10H8) in its structure, then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings "C1=CC=C(C=C1)C2(C(=O)NC(=O)N2)C3=CC=CC=C3" and "CC1C(C(C(C(O1)CO)OC2C(C(C(C(O2)COC3C(C(C(C(O3)CO)OC)O)O)OC4C(C(C(C(O4)CO)OC)O)OCCO)O)O)O)O".

================================

Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and a benzene ring, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The first two molecules in the given dataset contain both these groups and they are labeled as having side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule has a negatively charged oxygen atom bonded to one carbon atom and a positively charged calcium ion bonded to another carbon atom, then it may also have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The third molecule in the given dataset satisfies this condition and it is labeled as having side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a conjugated system of double bonds, then it may be toxic due to its ability to form free radicals. The sixth molecule in the given dataset satisfies this condition and it is labeled as potentially harmful.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
1. If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. The first example in the dataset contains a nitro group and has been labeled as having no such side effects.
2. If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to a carbon atom that also has two other bonds, one of which is a double bond or a triple bond, then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to the second example in the dataset, where the carbonyl group is part of a ring structure.
3. If the molecule contains a long chain of carbon atoms with multiple functional groups, including alcohols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids, then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to the last example in the dataset, which contains a long hydrocarbon chain with several alcohol and aldehyde groups.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a similar functional group, it may have endocrine disrupting activity. The first example in the dataset contains such a group and has been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds between two aromatic rings, it may also have endocrine disrupting activity. This rule applies to the second example in the dataset which contains a biphenyl group and has been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, it may also have endocrine disrupting activity. This rule applies to the third example in the dataset which contains a nitrobenzene group and has been labeled as having potential side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chloride ion (Cl-) or a zinc atom (Zn) in its structure, then it is likely to have side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms (-N=C=C-), then it is unlikely to have side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 0 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (-C6H5) or a naphthalene ring (-C10H7), then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. However, this rule is less certain than Rule 1 and Rule 2 because some molecules containing these rings do not have any reported side effects while others do. Therefore, additional factors such as the concentration and duration of exposure must also be considered when predicting the toxicity of a molecule.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the provided dataset. For example, the first molecule listed in the dataset contains both a sulfonyl group and a carbonyl group, which suggests that it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5) or a naphthalene ring (C10H8) in its structure, then it may not have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 0 in the provided dataset. For example, the second molecule listed in the dataset contains a benzene ring but no sulfonyl or carbonyl groups, which suggests that it may not have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to at least two carbon atoms, then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as either 1 or 0 in the provided dataset. For example, the third molecule listed in the dataset contains a nitrogen atom connected to four carbon atoms, which suggests that it may have potential

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a bromine atom, then it is likely to have side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to the first molecule in the dataset labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom and a benzene ring, then it is unlikely to have side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to the second molecule in the dataset labeled as 0.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonate group or a phosphate group, then it is likely to have side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to the fourth and fifth molecules in the dataset labeled as 1.
It's important to note that these rules are just educated guesses based on the limited information provided in the dataset. Further research and analysis would be needed to confirm their validity and applicability to other molecules.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group through a single bond, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a double bond, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The second molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule but has been labeled as not having such side effects. This suggests that there may be other factors involved in determining if a molecule has these side effects besides just its chemical structure.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, such as a pyrimidine or pyrazine ring, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The third molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule but has been labeled as not having such side effects. Again, this suggests that there may be other factors involved in determining if a molecule has these side effects besides just its chemical structure.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonate group (-SO3-) or a phosphate group (-PO4-), then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings O.O.O.O.O.[O-]S(=O)(=S)[O-].[Na+].[Na+] and CC1C(C(CC(O1)OC2CC(CC3=C(C4=C(C(=C23)O)C(=O)C5=C(C4=O)C=CC=C5OC)O)(C(=O)CO)O)[NH3+])O in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to four other atoms, including two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom, then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES string C1=CC(=C(C=C1)C#N)C(=O)ONC(C)C(C2=CC=C(C=C2)O)O in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to a carbon

================================

Rule 1: If there is any occurrence of the SMILES pattern "CC[C@H](C)[C@H]1C(=O)N[C@H]2CSSC[C@@H](C(=O)N[C@@H](CSSC[C@@H](C(=O)NCC(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@@H](CSSC[C@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a benzene ring in a compound may increase its potential for causing endocrine disorders as seen in SMILES strings labeled 1 and 9.
Rule 2: A compound containing a sulfonamide group may have a higher likelihood of causing endocrine disorders as seen in SMILES string labeled 8.
Rule 3: A compound containing a nitro group may also be associated with increased risk of endocrine disruption as seen in SMILES string labeled 7.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a fluorine atom present in the structure, then it may lead to potential endocrine disruption effects. The presence of fluorine atoms can affect the electronic and steric properties of the molecule, which can alter its binding affinity towards biological targets involved in hormonal regulation.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) or a carbonyl group (-COR), it may have potential adverse effects on human health due to their ability to bind to proteins and enzymes. These groups can form strong hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions with amino acid residues, leading to changes in protein conformation and function.
Rule 3: If the molecule has a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, it may also exhibit potential endocrine disrupting activities. Nitro groups can act as electron-withdrawing substituents, altering the electronic properties of the compound and affecting its interaction with hormone receptors. Additionally, some studies suggest that exposure to nitroaromatics can lead to DNA damage and oxidative stress, potentially contributing to chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a functional group such as "-COOH" or "-OH" in the structure of a molecule, then it may have potential for causing adverse effects on human health due to its ability to bind to proteins and disrupt their normal function. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.
Example: The first molecule in the dataset contains a "-COOH" group which could potentially lead to adverse effects if ingested by humans.
Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic rings such as "benzene" or "pyridine" may also pose a risk for adverse effects because they are known to interact with biological systems and can cause toxicity. Therefore, molecules containing these rings should be thoroughly tested before being used in pharmaceutical applications.
Example: The second molecule in the dataset contains a benzene ring which could contribute to its toxic nature.
Rule 3: If a molecule has a high degree of symmetry, it may be more likely to exhibit adverse effects due to its similarity to other molecules that are already known to be harmful. Therefore, symmetric molecules should be closely monitored for any potential risks.
Example: The third molecule in the dataset has a highly symmetrical structure which could make it more prone to adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) or a carbonyl group (-COR) in addition to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. The first two groups are known to bind to receptors in the body, which can lead to hormonal imbalances and other health problems.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may also have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. Nitro groups are known to disrupt hormone production and metabolism by binding to receptors in the body.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as fluorine (-F) or chlorine (-Cl), then it may also have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. Halogen atoms can affect the chemical and physical properties of molecules, including their reactivity and hydrophobicity, which can impact their interactions with biological systems.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing endocrine disorders as they can interfere with hormone production or function. For example, the presence of a phenol group in a molecule may mimic estrogen and disrupt hormonal balance. Therefore, molecules containing such groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule may also play a role in determining its ability to interact with biological systems and potentially cause adverse effects. Molecules that are too large or have a non-optimal shape may be less likely to penetrate cell membranes and reach their target sites. Therefore, molecules with appropriate sizes and shapes may be more likely to exhibit desired activities without causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule may also affect its activity and potential for causing adverse effects. For example, the configuration of chiral centers in a molecule may determine its interaction with receptors and influence its potency and efficacy. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the stereochemical properties of candidate molecules when designing therapeutic agents.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) and has a negative charge on one of its oxygen atoms, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The first example in the dataset contains such a structure and has been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The second example in the dataset contains such a structure and has also been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a phosphonic acid group (-PO3H2) or a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) bonded to an aliphatic chain, then it may not have any significant side effects related to endocrine disorders. The third and fourth examples in the dataset contain such structures and have been labeled as not having potential side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a nitrate group (-ONO2), then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 12, 13, 14 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 15, 16, 17 in the dataset.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and have labels of 1, indicating they do have such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may also have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. The fourth molecule in the dataset contains this group and has a label of 1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to four other atoms, including one oxygen atom, then it may also have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This is because such a structure is similar to that of hormones, which are chemical messengers that regulate many bodily functions, including those related to the endocrine system. The seventh molecule in the dataset contains this structure and has a label of 1.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a benzene ring, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The first example in the dataset satisfies this rule.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a pyridine ring (a six-membered aromatic heterocycle with one nitrogen atom), then it may not have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The second example in the dataset does not satisfy this rule because it contains a pyrimidine ring instead of a pyridine ring.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may not have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The third example in the dataset does not satisfy this rule because there is no such fluorine atom present.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional groups such as amines or amides in a compound, then it may have potential side effects on the endocrine system. This rule can be applied to the first and third SMILES strings where the compounds contain amine groups which could potentially lead to endocrine disruption.
Rule 2: If a compound contains aromatic rings, it may also contribute to its ability to disrupt the endocrine system. The second and fifth SMILES strings contain benzene rings which could increase their likelihood of causing endocrine disruptions.
Rule 3: A compound containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine may also pose a risk for disrupting the endocrine system. The sixth SMILES string contains both chlorine and fluoride atoms which could potentially interact with hormones and affect their function.

================================

Based on these examples, here are three possible rules for predicting if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a similar functional group, it may have endocrine disrupting activity. This is because sulfonamides are known to interfere with hormone production in the body. The first example molecule contains such a group, which could explain why it was labeled as having potential side effects related to endocrine disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to a double bond, it may also have endocrine disrupting activity. This is because fluorinated compounds often have different chemical and physical properties than their non-fluorinated counterparts, and some studies suggest that they can disrupt hormonal signaling pathways. The second example molecule contains such a group, but further research would be needed to confirm this hypothesis.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, it may also have endocrine disrupting activity. Conjugated systems can affect the electronic properties of molecules, which can impact their reactivity and ability to interact with biological systems. The third example molecule contains such a system, but again, more research would be needed to determine how it might contribute to any potential side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels of 1 indicating their association with endocrine disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom (-F) attached to a carbon atom at the para position relative to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may also have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains this structural feature and it has a label of 1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrile group (-CN) adjacent to a sulfur atom, then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. The sixth molecule in the dataset contains this structural feature and it has a label of 1.
