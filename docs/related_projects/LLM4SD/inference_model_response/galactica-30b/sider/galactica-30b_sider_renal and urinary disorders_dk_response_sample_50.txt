Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amides or sulfonamides in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the kidneys and urinary system. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1. For example, the first molecule contains two amide groups and one sulfonamide group, which could contribute to its nephrotoxicity.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects if they are substituted with halogen atoms like chlorine or fluorine. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1. For instance, the fifth molecule has a chlorinated phenyl ring, which could enhance its ability to interact with biological targets and potentially cause toxicity.
Rule 3: Compounds with a high degree of hydrophobicity may have a greater tendency to accumulate in lipid membranes and disrupt their function. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as either 0 or 1. For example, the thirteenth molecule contains a long hydrophobic chain, which could make it more likely to penetrate cell membranes and interfere with cellular processes.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amides, sulfonamides, and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on renal and urinary systems.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects on these systems due to their ability to bind to proteins and disrupt normal cellular processes.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound may also play a role in determining its potential to cause adverse effects on renal and urinary systems. Compounds with high molecular weights and hydrophobicities may be more likely to accumulate in tissues and organs, leading to toxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) or a carbonyl group (-COR), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The second molecule in the dataset does not satisfy this rule as it contains both a sulfonyl group and a carbonyl group.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The third molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule but also contains a hydroxyl group which could potentially counteract the effect of the benzene ring.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom, then it is likely to have side-effects associated with renal and urinary disorders. The presence of a halogen like chlorine in a molecule can increase its lipophilicity, which may lead to increased absorption into the body and potentially harmful interactions with other molecules or tissues. Therefore, this rule suggests that caution should be exercised when using such compounds.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, as seen in the second and third SMILES strings provided, then it is more likely to have side-effects associated with renal and urinary disorders. Conjugated systems can enhance the reactivity of a molecule by allowing for easier electron transfer across multiple bonds. This increased reactivity can make the compound more susceptible to attack by other molecules or enzymes within the body, leading to unwanted reactions or toxicity.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), as seen in the last two SMILES strings provided, then it is highly likely to have side-effects associated with renal and urinary disorders. Sulfonamides are known to interfere with the production of folic acid, which is essential for the growth and repair of cells throughout the body. When taken in high doses, they can cause serious damage to the kidneys and other organs, particularly in individuals with impaired kidney function.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided in the given dataset and may not apply to all types of molecules or

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a functional group such as -COOH or -OH, it may cause adverse effects on renal and urinary systems. This rule applies to compounds in rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a phosphorus atom bonded to two oxygen atoms in addition to one carbon and one nitrogen atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to the first SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a conjugated system consisting of alternating double bonds and single bonds between carbon atoms, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to the second SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring or a pyridine ring, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to all other molecules in the dataset except for the third and fourth ones which contain both rings but still do not have any adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects on renal and urinary disorders. The first three molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they all have label 1 indicating their association with renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure has a fluorine atom attached to a benzene ring, then it may also have potential side effects on renal and urinary disorders. The fourth molecule in the dataset contains this feature and it has label 1 as well.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a cyano group (-CN) adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may be associated with nephrotoxicity. The last two molecules in the dataset contain this structural motif and both have label 1.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The first molecule in the dataset containing this functional group is labeled as 1, which indicates that it does have such potential.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The second molecule in the dataset containing this functional group is labeled as 0, which suggests that it does not have such potential. However, it's important to note that this rule should only be considered as a general guideline and not a definitive predictor.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sodium ion (Na+) and an iodide ion (I-), it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The third molecule in the dataset containing these ions is labeled as 0, which supports this hypothesis.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a urea group (-CONHCONH2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The first example in the dataset contains both groups and is labeled as having such potential.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The second example in the dataset contains this group and is labeled as having such potential.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrile group (-CN) adjacent to an aromatic ring, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The third example in the dataset contains this group and is labeled as having such potential.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of chlorine atom in the structure of the molecule, then it may have potential for causing adverse effects on renal and urinary systems. The first three molecules in the given dataset contain chlorine atoms which could be responsible for their associated activities.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it has high probability of exhibiting adverse effects on kidneys. The fourth and fifth molecules in the dataset contain these groups respectively, and they both exhibit nephrotoxicity.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, then it may also possess nephrotoxic properties. The sixth molecule in the dataset contains a benzene ring and exhibits toxicity towards kidney cells.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring or a heterocyclic ring system, it may have potential nephrotoxicity. The presence of such rings in molecules has been linked to increased risk of kidney damage due to their ability to bind to proteins and disrupt normal cellular processes. Therefore, if a compound contains these types of rings, it should be labeled as having potential for causing renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains functional groups like carboxylic acid, amide, or sulfonamide, it may also have potential nephrotoxicity. These groups can interact with biological macromolecules like proteins and nucleic acids, leading to cell injury and death. Therefore, compounds containing these functional groups should also be considered as potentially harmful to kidneys.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains halogen atoms like chlorine or fluorine, it may increase the likelihood of renal toxicity. Halogenated hydrocarbons are known to cause acute tubular necrosis, which is a common form of kidney injury. Therefore, compounds containing halogens should be carefully evaluated for their potential to cause renal and urinary disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a carbonyl group (=O) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1=CN=CC=C1N 0, CN(C)CC(C1=CC=C(C=C1)O)C2(CCCCC2)O 1, CCCCC(=O)OCC(=O)[C@]1(C[C@@H](C2=C(C3=C(C(=C2C1)O)C(=O)C4=C(C3=O)C(=CC=C4)OC)O)OC5CC(C(C(O5)C)O)NC(=O)C(F)(F)F)O 1, C1CN(CCN1CCCN2C3=CC=CC=C3SC4=C2C=C(C=C4)C(F)(F)F)CCO 1, [La] 0, C1CN=C(N1)NC2=C(C=CC3=NSN=C32)Cl

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a benzene ring in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on renal and urinary systems. This rule can be applied to molecules such as C(C(C(C(C(CO)O)O)O)O)O, CC1=C(C=C(C=C1)NC(=O)C2=CC=C(C=C2)CN3CCN(CC3)C)NC4=NC=CC(=N4)C5=CN=CC=C5, CNC1=CC=C(C=C1)/C=C/C2=CC=C(C=C2)OCCOCCOCCOCC[18F], CCC1=C(C(=O)N2CCCCC2=N1)CCN3CCC(CC3)C4=NOC5=C4C=CC(=C5)F, CCNC1=CC=C(C=C1)/C=C/C2=CC=C(C=C2)OCCOCCOCCOCC[18F], CNC1=CC=C(C=C1)/C=C/C2=CC=C(C=C2)OCCOCCOCCOCC[18F], COC1=NN=C2CS(=O)(=O)C(C(=O)N3CCSCC3)=

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The first four molecules in the dataset contain either one or both of these groups, so they all have the potential to cause such effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) attached to a benzene ring, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth molecules in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) connected to a carbon chain, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to the ninth molecule in the dataset.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the dataset and should be used as guidelines only. Actual testing would be necessary to determine if any particular molecule actually causes adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a similar functional group, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The first molecule in the dataset contains such a group and is labeled as having the potential for these types of adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The second molecule in the dataset contains this type of structure and is labeled as having no potential for these types of adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine or chlorine) bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains this type of structure and is labeled as having the potential for these types of adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) or a phosphate group (-OPO3R2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The presence of these groups in a molecule can lead to the formation of metabolites that can accumulate in the body and cause damage to the kidneys.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. Carboxylic acids can irritate the skin and mucous membranes, which can lead to inflammation and irritation of the kidneys.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. Nitro compounds can cause methemoglobinemia, which can lead to tissue hypoxia and damage to the kidneys.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a functional group such as -COOH or -OH in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on kidneys and urinary system. This rule can be applied to compounds #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25, #26, #27, #28, #29, #30, #31, #32, #33, #34, #35, #36, #37, #38, #39, #40, #41, #42, #43, #44, #45, #46, #47, #48, #49, #50, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #57, #58, #59, #60, #61, #62, #63, #64, #65, #66, #67, #68, #69, #70, #71, #72, #73, #74, #75, #76, #77, #78, #79, #80, #81, #82, #8

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as a carboxylic acid or its derivatives, it may lead to adverse effects in the kidney and urinary system. The presence of these groups increases the polarity of the compound, which makes it more likely to be excreted through urine. This can result in irritation or inflammation of the bladder or kidneys.
Example: Molecule #9 has a carboxylic acid group, so it is labeled as 1 for causing adverse effects on the kidney and urinary system.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring or other aromatic rings, it may also contribute to adverse effects in the kidney and urinary system. These structures can increase the hydrophobicity of the compound, making it more likely to accumulate in tissues and cells. This can lead to cellular damage and tissue inflammation.
Example: Molecules #7 and #10 have aromatic rings, so they are both labeled as 1 for causing adverse effects on the kidney and urinary system.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, it may also contribute to adverse effects in the kidney and urinary system. Nitrogen-containing heterocycles can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions. They can also form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, increasing the solubility of the compound and making it more likely to be excreted through urine.
Example: Molecule #11 has a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, so it is labeled as 1 for causing adverse effects on the kidney and urinary system.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The first molecule in the dataset contains a nitro group and is labeled as having no such potential.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to a double bond or aromatic ring, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The second molecule in the dataset contains this structural feature and is labeled as having no such potential.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) attached to an aromatic ring, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The sixth molecule in the dataset contains a chlorine atom attached to an aromatic ring and is labeled as having no such potential.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a nitro group (-NO2) present in the structure of a molecule, then it may have potential side effects on renal and urinary disorders. The presence of this functional group may increase the polarity of the molecule which could lead to its accumulation in the kidney tissue causing damage or irritation. Therefore, molecules containing such groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfhydryl group (-SH), it may also have potential side effects on renal and urinary disorders due to its ability to form covalent bonds with other proteins leading to their inactivation. Such compounds should therefore be used cautiously.
Rule 3: If a molecule has a negative charge at physiological pH, it may interact with positively charged ions like sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) in the body resulting in electrolyte imbalance and potentially affecting renal function. Therefore, neutral or slightly basic molecules should be preferred for therapeutic use.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels indicating their association with such disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The fourth molecule in the dataset contains this group but its label indicates no association with such disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom like chlorine (Cl), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The seventh molecule in the dataset contains Cl and its label indicates its association with such disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of iodine atoms in the molecular structure may indicate potential renal and urinary disorders as a side effect. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 in the given dataset.
Rule 2: The presence of sodium ions in the molecular structure may also suggest potential renal and urinary disorders as a side effect. However, this rule should be used cautiously since other factors such as concentration and exposure time could affect its toxicity. Therefore, this rule can only serve as a preliminary indicator and further analysis would be required before making any conclusions.
Rule 3: The absence of specific functional groups or substructures in the molecular structure may reduce the likelihood of causing adverse effects on renal and urinary systems. For example, molecules labeled as 0 in the given dataset do not contain certain functional groups like carbonyl or carboxyl groups which have been linked to nephrotoxicity.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a functional group such as "-COOH" or "-CONH2" in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on renal and urinary disorders. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, in the first SMILES string, the presence of "-COOH" and "-CONH2" groups may contribute to its potential for causing adverse effects on renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a heterocyclic ring system, especially those containing nitrogen atoms, then it may also lead to adverse effects on renal and urinary disorders. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For instance, in the second SMILES string, the presence of a pyrimidine ring may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects on renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure has a high degree of symmetry, then it may have a lower probability of causing adverse effects on renal and urinary disorders. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 0 in the given dataset. For example, in the sixth SMILES string, the symmetrical arrangement of two phenyl rings may reduce its ability to interact with biological systems and thus decrease its potential for causing adverse effects on renal and urinary disorders.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have adverse effects on renal and urinary disorders. The presence of these functional groups in a compound can increase its acidity and polarity, which can lead to increased absorption through the kidneys and potential damage.
Example: Molecule A has a sulfonamide group and is labeled as having adverse effects on renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) conjugated with an alkene or alkyne group, then it may have adverse effects on renal and urinary disorders. This type of conjugation can increase the compound's hydrophobicity and make it more likely to be absorbed by the body.
Example: Molecule B has a carboxylic acid group conjugated with an alkene group and is labeled as having adverse effects on renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), then it may have adverse effects on renal and urinary disorders. Halogen atoms can increase the compound's lipophilicity and enhance its ability to cross cell membranes, including those of the kidney tubules.
Example: Molecule C has two chlorine atoms and is labeled as having adverse effects on renal and urinary disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CC1=C(C(C(=C(N1)C)C(=O)OC(C)C)C2=CC(=CC=C2)[N+](=O)[O-])C(=O)OCCOC, C1C(C(OC1N2C=C(C(=O)NC2=O)I)CO)O, and CCC1CCC[C@@H](C(C(=O)C2=C[C@H]3[C@@H]4C[C@@H](C[C@H]4C=C[C@H]3[C@@H]2CC(=O)O1)O[C@H]5[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O5)C)OC)OC)OC)C)O[C@H]6CCC([C@H](O6)C)N(C)C.CCC1CCC[C@@H](C(C(=O)C2=C[C@H]3[C@@H]4C[C@@H](C[C@H]4C(=C[C@H]3[C@@H]2CC(=O

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings "C(CNCCNCCN)N", "CCN(CC)CC(=O)NC1=C(C=CC=C1C)C", "C1CC(N(C1)C(=O)C2CSSCC(C(=O)NC(C(=O)NC(C(=O)NC(C(=O)NC(C(=O)N2)CC(=O)N)CCC(=O)N)CC3=CC=CC=C3)CC4=CC=C(C=C4)O)N)C(=O)NC(CCCN=C(N)N)C(=O)NCC(=O)N", "CC1CN(CC(N1)C)C2=C(C3=C(C(=C2F)N)C(=O)C(=CN3C4CC4)C(=O)O)F",

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the kidneys and urinary system. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1. For example, in the first molecule provided, the sulfonamide group is present and may contribute to its potential for renal and urinary toxicity.
Rule 2: A compound containing a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring has a higher chance of causing adverse effects on the kidney and urinary tract than one without such a group. This rule can also be applied to molecules labeled as 1. For instance, in the second molecule listed, the nitro group may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity compared to other compounds lacking this functional group.
Rule 3: Molecules with a high degree of conjugation between multiple aromatic rings or double bonds have a lower probability of causing adverse effects on the kidney and urinary tract. This rule can be used to identify molecules labeled as 0. For example, in the third molecule shown, the highly conjugated structure may make it less likely to interact with biological targets involved in renal and urinary toxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains barium ions (Ba+2) in its structure, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The presence of Ba+2 ions indicates that the molecule may interact with other molecules or ions in the body, which could lead to negative health consequences. However, this rule should be used cautiously as there may be other factors that contribute to the adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) attached to an aromatic ring, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. Sulfonyl groups are commonly found in medications such as glipizide and glyburide, which are known to cause hypoglycemia and other side effects. These types of structures may interfere with the normal function of insulin in the body, leading to negative health consequences. Again, this rule should be used cautiously as there may be other factors that contribute to the adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. Nitro groups are commonly found in medications such as nitrofurantoin and nifuratel, which are known to cause urinary tract infections and other side effects. These types of structures may damage the cells in the kidneys and bladder

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "CCCCC1=NC(=C(N1CC2=CC=C(C=C2)C3=CC=CC=C3C4=NNN=N4)CO)Cl 1" or "C1=NC2=C(N1[C@H]3[C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O3)CO)O)F)N=C(N=C2N)Cl 1".
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (represented as "C=O" in the SMILES string) connected to two alkyl groups (represented as "R" in the SMILES string), where one of the alkyl groups is a phenyl group (represented as "Ph" in the SMILES string), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "CC#CC1(CCC2C1(CC(C3=C4CCC(=O)C=C4CCC23)C5=CC=C(C=C5)N(C)C)C)O

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as a carboxylic acid or its derivatives, it may lead to adverse effects on kidneys and urine. The presence of this functional group increases the polarity of the compound, which makes it more likely to be excreted through the kidney. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be avoided in drug development.
Rule 2: Molecules having a high degree of conjugation between π bonds tend to have lower solubility in water and higher lipophilicity than those without conjugation. This property can increase their ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological systems. However, excessive conjugation can also make them less reactive and potentially toxic due to their low reactivity towards other molecules. Therefore, careful consideration must be given when designing drugs with highly conjugated structures.
Rule 3: A molecule's size and shape play important roles in determining its pharmacokinetic profile. Large and complex molecules often have poor membrane permeability and bioavailability compared to smaller ones. Additionally, certain structural features like aromatic rings and rigid structures can affect the molecule's metabolic stability and toxicity. Therefore, medicinal chemists need to carefully consider these factors while designing new drugs.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The first molecule in the dataset contains a sulfonyl group and is labeled as having the potential for such effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a fluoro group (-F) attached to a phenyl ring, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The second molecule in the dataset contains this structural feature and is labeled as having the potential for such effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) adjacent to a double bond or triple bond, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This structural feature appears in several molecules in the dataset, including the third one which is labeled as not having the potential for such effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amides, carboxylic acids, and sulfonamides in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on renal and urinary systems. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1. For example, the first molecule contains a carboxamide group which may contribute to its nephrotoxicity.
Rule 2: The presence of aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds in a compound may also increase its potential for causing adverse effects on renal and urinary systems. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1. For instance, the second molecule has two phenyl rings which may enhance its ability to bind to biological targets.
Rule 3: The absence of certain functional groups or structural features in a compound may decrease its potential for causing adverse effects on renal and urinary systems. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 0. For example, the third molecule does not contain any amide or carboxylic acid groups, which may explain why it did not show any significant toxicity towards these organs.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom in the form of a double bond or triple bond, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to four other atoms, including two carbon atoms and two hydrogen atoms, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules 2 and 3.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom connected to a carbon atom through a single bond, and there exists at least one non-aromatic ring containing five or six atoms, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules 4 and 5.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of strontium ions in the molecular structure may indicate potential renal and urinary disorders as they tend to accumulate in these organs causing damage over time. Therefore, molecules containing strontium ions should be labeled as having a high risk for such adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing functional groups like sulfonyl or carbonyl groups have a higher chance of causing adverse effects due to their ability to bind to proteins and disrupt normal cellular functions. Hence, molecules containing these groups should be labeled as potentially harmful.
Rule 3: Molecules containing aromatic rings or halogen atoms like chlorine or fluorine may also increase the likelihood of adverse effects because of their chemical reactivity and tendency to form covalent bonds with other molecules. Thus, molecules containing these moieties should be carefully evaluated before labeling them as safe.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional groups such as amides or ureas in a compound, then it may have potential for causing adverse effects on kidneys due to their ability to bind to proteins and disrupt normal cellular processes. Therefore, compounds containing these functional groups should be labeled as having high risk of causing renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings may also pose a higher risk of causing adverse effects on kidneys if they contain substituents such as nitro or amino groups which can increase their polarity and water solubility. These types of compounds tend to accumulate in the body over time and can lead to damage to kidney tissues.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a compound's structure can also play a role in its potential to cause adverse effects. Longer chains of carbon atoms and more complex structures may make it harder for the body to break down and eliminate the compound, leading to accumulation and toxicity. Therefore, compounds with longer chain lengths and more complex structures should be labeled as having a higher risk of causing renal and urinary disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide, nitro, fluoride, and carboxylic acid in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on renal and urinary systems.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to bind to proteins or enzymes in the body, which could lead to unwanted reactions or disruptions in normal physiological processes. For example, the sulfonamide group found in some antibiotics has been known to cause kidney damage by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which is important for maintaining proper fluid balance in the kidneys.
Rule 2: A molecule containing conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings may also increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on renal and urinary systems.
Explanation: Conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings can enhance the stability and reactivity of a molecule, making it more likely to interact with biological molecules and disrupt their functions. For instance, certain dyes used in textiles have been linked to cases of acute kidney injury due to their ability to form crystals in the urine.
Rule 3: Molecules with a high degree of polarity or hydrophilicity may be less likely to cross the cell membrane and enter the bloodstream, reducing their potential to cause adverse effects on renal and urinary systems.
Explanation: Polar molecules tend to attract water molecules and are more soluble in aqueous solutions, which makes them less likely to accumulate in tissues or organs. Therefore, polar compounds like glucose and amino acids are generally considered safe for consumption even at high doses.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as a carbonyl group (C=O) or a carboxylic acid group (COOH), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to at least two carbon atoms, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 in the dataset

================================

Rule 1: If there is a sulfonamide group present in the structure of a molecule, then it may have adverse effects on kidneys and urinary system. The given SMILES string CC1(C(NC(S1)C(C(=O)NCCCCCC(=O)O)NC(=O)CC2=CC=CC=C2)C(=O)O)C contains a sulfonamide group which matches this rule. Therefore, we can conclude that this molecule has potential adverse effects on kidney and urinary system.
Rule 2: If there is a halogen atom present in the structure of a molecule, especially fluorine or chlorine atoms, then it may have adverse effects on the central nervous system. The given SMILES strings Cl[Tl] and C1=CC(=CC=C1CCCC(=O)O)N(CCCl)CCCl contain fluoride and chloride atoms respectively, which match this rule. Therefore, we can conclude that these molecules have potential adverse effects on the central nervous system.
Rule 3: If there is a nitro group present in the structure of a molecule, then it may have adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. The given SMILES string FS(F)(F)(F)(F)F contains a nitro group which matches this rule. Therefore, we can conclude that this molecule has potential adverse effects on the cardiovascular system.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels indicating their association with such disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (-C=O) through a single bond, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This structure is present in several other molecules in the dataset as well, all of which have labels indicating their association with such disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. None of the last four molecules in the dataset contain halogens, and none of them have labels indicating any association with such disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (represented by the SMILES string C6H5 in the dataset), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by the SMILES strings CCC(=C)C(=O)C1=C(C(=C(C=C1)OCC(=O)O)Cl)Cl, CC1=NN=C(S1)C2=CC=CC=C2, and NC(=O)c2ccc(cc2)n2cnc(nc2)c2ccccc2.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (represented by the SMILES string SO2N in the dataset), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by the SMILES strings C[C@@]1(C2C[C@H]3[C@@H](C(=O)C(=C([C@]3(C(=O)C2=C(C4=C1C=CC=C4O)O)O)O)C(=O)NCNCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)N)N(C)C)O and COC(=O)C1=C(C(=C(C=C1)OCC(

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as a sulfonamide or a nitro group, then it may have adverse effects on the kidney and urinary system. The presence of these groups increases the chances of the molecule interacting with the kidneys and causing damage.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure has a high degree of conjugation, then it may also have adverse effects on the kidney and urinary system. Conjugation occurs when multiple functional groups are connected together through a chain of atoms. This increases the stability of the molecule but also makes it more likely to interact with other molecules in the body.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it may have adverse effects on the kidney and urinary system. Halogen atoms can increase the polarity of the molecule, making it more water-soluble and easier to excrete from the body. However, if they are present in excess or bonded to certain metals, they can be toxic and cause damage to the kidneys and other organs.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a chlorine atom in the structure may indicate potential renal and urinary disorders as a side effect. This rule applies to molecules such as "CCCCCCCCCC(=O)N[C@@H]1[C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O[C@H]1OC2=C3C=C4C=C2OC5=C(C=C(C=C5)[C@H]([C@H]6C(=O)N[C@H](C7=CC(=CC(=C7C8=C(C=CC(=C8)[C@H](C(=O)N6)NC(=O)[C@@H]4NC(=O)[C@@H]9C1=CC(=CC(=C1)O)OC1=C(C=CC(=C1)[C@@H](C(=O)N[C@H](CC1=CC(=C(O3)C=C1)Cl)C(=O)N9)N)O)O[C@@H]1[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O1)CO)O)O)O)O)C(=O)O)O[C@H]1[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, it may have potential side effects on renal and urinary systems. The presence of these functional groups increases the polarity of the molecule which makes it more likely to be excreted through urine leading to kidney damage. Therefore, compounds containing such groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: Compounds having a nitro group (-NO2) in their structure tend to exhibit nephrotoxicity due to the formation of reactive metabolites that bind to cellular macromolecules causing tissue injury. Hence, molecules possessing this moiety should also be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.
Rule 3: Molecules bearing a heterocyclic ring system like pyridine, pyrimidine etc. may pose a risk of inducing renal toxicity as they are known to interfere with normal physiological processes within the body. Thus, caution must be exercised while using such compounds especially at higher doses.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules in rows 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), it may have potential renal and urinary disorders as side effects. The first two molecules in the given dataset contain these groups and they both have label 1 indicating their association with such side effects.
Rule 2: If a compound has a polar functional group like -OH, -COOH, -CONH2 etc., it may be associated with renal and urinary disorders due to its ability to interact with water molecules and affect the normal functioning of kidneys. The third molecule in the dataset contains a sugar moiety which is highly polar and hence it has label 0 indicating no relation with the specified side effects.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a conjugated system of double bonds, it may also contribute to the occurrence of renal and urinary disorders. This is because conjugation increases the stability of the molecule but at the same time makes it more reactive towards other molecules including those present in the body fluids. The fourth molecule in the dataset contains a phenyl ring which is a common feature in many drugs and pigments having this type of structure. However, since there is no specific information about any relationship between this particular structural feature and the specified side effects, we cannot make a definitive prediction for this case.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a phosphate group (-PO4-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The presence of these groups in a molecule can lead to the formation of metabolites that can accumulate in the body and cause damage to the kidneys.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. Carboxylic acids can irritate the skin and mucous membranes, which can lead to inflammation and irritation of the kidneys.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. Nitro compounds can cause methemoglobinemia, which can lead to tissue hypoxia and damage to the kidneys.

================================
