Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as carbonyl or carboxyl groups, it may lead to potential toxicity. The presence of these groups increases the reactivity of the compound and makes it more susceptible to metabolism by enzymes in the body. This can result in the formation of toxic metabolites that can cause adverse effects.
Example: Molecule 6 has a carbonyl group which may contribute to its potential toxicity.
Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also have increased toxicity due to their ability to interact with biological molecules through π-π stacking interactions. These types of compounds are often associated with mutagenic and carcinogenic activities.
Example: Molecule 8 has two phenyl rings which could increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: Compounds with a high degree of lipophilicity tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues such as the brain and liver, leading to potential toxicity. Therefore, molecules with a high logP value (a measure of hydrophobicity) should be evaluated for potential toxicity.
Example: Molecule 9 has a relatively high logP value compared to other compounds in the dataset, indicating that it may have higher potential for accumulation in lipid-rich tissues.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the sulfonamide group present in the second SMILES string may be associated with allergic reactions or other adverse effects. Therefore, if a molecule contains such groups, it should be carefully evaluated for potential risks.
Rule 2: The length and complexity of a molecule may also affect its ability to cause adverse effects. Generally, longer and more complex molecules tend to have lower bioavailability and higher toxicity. Therefore, simpler molecules may be less likely to cause adverse effects than more complex ones.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule may play a role in determining its biological activity and potential adverse effects. For example, the configuration of chiral centers in a molecule may affect its binding affinity to target proteins or enzymes. Therefore, it is important to consider both the structure and stereochemistry of a molecule when evaluating its potential safety profile.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the first molecule listed in the dataset contains both a cyano group and a carbonyl group, which suggests that it may have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) in its structure, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule also applies to molecules labeled as "1" in the dataset. The second molecule listed in the dataset contains a sulfonyl group, which suggests that it may have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (-Cl) or fluorine (-F) in its structure, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to all molecules in the dataset, regardless of their labels. The third molecule listed in the dataset contains two chlorine atoms, which suggests that it may have the potential to cause adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecular structure, then it may lead to potential adverse effects. The presence of this functional group may increase the reactivity and toxicity of the compound. Therefore, molecules containing such groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring, especially if it is substituted with electron-withdrawing groups like -NO2 or -COOH, then it may also contribute to potential adverse effects. These substituents can increase the reactivity of the aromatic ring, leading to increased toxicity.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may have potential adverse effects due to its ability to inhibit certain enzymes involved in various metabolic processes. This inhibition can lead to serious health problems including skin rashes, liver damage, and kidney failure.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a gadolinium ion ([Gd+3]) in its structure, then it is likely to have side effects. This rule is based on the fact that gadolinium ions are known to be toxic and can cause adverse reactions in some individuals. Therefore, molecules containing this element should be carefully evaluated for their safety before being used in any investigation.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl) attached to a nitrogen atom (N) in its structure, and also contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have side effects. This rule is based on the fact that nitro compounds are known to be toxic and can cause adverse reactions in some individuals. Therefore, molecules containing these elements should be carefully evaluated for their safety before being used in any investigation.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) adjacent to a double bond (=C) in its structure, then it may have side effects. This rule is based on the fact that such structures can be reactive and can interact with other molecules in the body, potentially causing adverse reactions. Therefore, molecules containing these elements should be carefully evaluated for their safety before being used in any investigation.

================================

Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule may also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects. Molecules with a larger surface area may have more opportunities to interact with biological systems, leading to increased reactivity and potentially harmful effects. Additionally, the spatial arrangement of atoms within a molecule may affect its ability to bind to specific targets within cells.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule can also impact its biological activity. For example, the configuration of chiral centers in a molecule can determine its ability to interact with receptors or enzymes in a specific manner. Therefore, it is important to consider the stereochemical features of a molecule when evaluating its potential side effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of iodine atoms in the molecular structure may indicate potential side effects.
Explanation: Iodine is essential for thyroid hormone production and its excess or deficiency can lead to various health problems including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, goiter, and autoimmune diseases. Therefore, molecules containing iodine atoms may have a higher chance of causing adverse effects on the thyroid gland.
Rule 2: The presence of negatively charged functional groups such as carboxylates and sulfonates may increase the likelihood of side effects.
Explanation: Negatively charged functional groups can interact with positively charged amino acid residues in proteins, leading to changes in protein conformation and function. This can result in altered cell signaling pathways and potentially harmful effects on cellular processes.
Rule 3: Molecules containing aromatic rings may also be associated with increased risk of side effects due to their ability to bind to biological targets through π-π interactions.
Explanation: Aromatic rings are commonly found in drugs and other biologically active compounds and play important roles in drug-target binding. However, they can also contribute to off-target interactions and toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of functional groups such as -COOH or -OH in the structure of the molecule, then it may lead to adverse effects. This rule is based on the fact that these functional groups can interact with other molecules and disrupt their normal functioning. For example, in the first SMILES string, the presence of the -COOH group may cause irritation upon contact with skin.
Rule 2: If the molecular weight of the compound is high, then it may also lead to adverse effects. This rule is based on the fact that larger compounds have more atoms and therefore more potential for interaction with other molecules. For example, in the second SMILES string, the molecular weight of the compound is relatively high at 901 g/mol which may make it difficult to excrete from the body leading to accumulation and potential toxicity.
Rule 3: If the compound contains metals or metal ions, then it may also lead to adverse effects. This rule is based on the fact that metals can react with other molecules and disrupt their normal functioning. For example, in the sixth SMILES string, the presence of iron ions may cause oxidative stress leading to cellular damage.

Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have potential side effects. This rule applies to molecules #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25, #26, #27, #28, #29, #30, #31 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects. This rule applies to molecules #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three possible rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains two gold atoms, then it is likely to have side effects. This rule is based on the fact that some drugs containing gold have been associated with side effects such as skin rashes and liver damage. However, this rule should be taken with caution since there may be other factors involved in causing these side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfhydryl group (represented by the SMILES notation "SH2+") and a carbonyl group (represented by the SMILES notation "C=O"), then it is unlikely to have side effects. This rule is based on the fact that many molecules containing both groups are essential for biological processes and do not have any known side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom, then it is likely to have side effects. This rule is based on the fact that several drugs containing chlorine atoms have been associated with various side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The first example in the dataset contains both groups and is labeled as having the potential for adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. The third example in the dataset contains two chlorines and is labeled as having the potential for adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrile group (-CN), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects. The last example in the dataset contains a nitrile group but is still labeled as having no potential for adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as cyanide or azide, it may have toxic effects on living organisms. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be labeled as having potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds may also have toxic effects due to their ability to interact with biological systems. Therefore, molecules containing these structural features should also be labeled as potentially harmful.
Rule 3: The presence of certain atoms in the molecular structure, such as iron or sodium, may indicate potential toxicity if they are present at high concentrations. However, this rule is less specific than Rules 1 and 2 because the concentration required for toxicity may vary depending on other factors such as the type of organism being exposed.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a phosphate group (PO4R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule is supported by the fact that these groups are commonly found in drugs that have been associated with serious side effects such as liver damage and muscle weakness.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. Nitro groups are often used in explosives and are known to be toxic. They can react with other molecules in the body to form reactive oxygen species which can lead to oxidative stress and tissue damage.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) attached to an aromatic ring, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. Halogen atoms can make molecules more reactive and can increase their ability to bind to biological targets. However, this rule should be applied cautiously since some halogens are essential for normal physiological function and can even have therapeutic benefits.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the nitro group (-NO2) and the carbonyl group (-C=O) are known to be toxic and can cause adverse reactions in the body. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxicity.
Rule 2: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a molecule can also affect its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets. Molecules with high molecular weights or hydrophobicities may have difficulty crossing cell membranes and reaching their target sites, which could reduce their efficacy and increase their risk of adverse effects.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule can play a significant role in determining its bioactivity and toxicity. For instance, some enantiomers may exhibit different pharmacological activities or toxicities due to differences in their three-dimensional structures. Therefore, it is important to consider the stereochemical configuration of a molecule when evaluating its potential risks and benefits.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a phosphate group (-PO4) or a sulfonate group (-SO3), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule is supported by the presence of these groups in molecules such as OP(=O)(O)[O-], C(CS)N, CC(=O)NP(=O)(O)OH, CS(=O)(=O)CCNCC1=CC=C(O1)C2=CC3=C(C=C2)N=CN=C3NC4=CC(=C(C=C4)OCC5=CC(=CC=C5)F)Cl, CN(C)C1=CC2=C(C=C1)N=C3C=CC(=[N+](C)C)C=C3S2, CCS(=O)(=O)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(cc1)C(I)Br, COC1=CC=C(C=C1)CC2=C(C=CC(=C2)[C@H]3[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O3)CO)O)O)O)Cl, CCCCNN1C2=CC=CC=C2CCC3=CC=CC=

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as fluorine (-F), chlorine (-Cl), bromine (-Br), or iodine (-I), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to compounds labeled with "1" in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an aromatic ring, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to compounds labeled with "1" in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a metal ion such as strontium (Sr+2) or gadolinium (Gd+3), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to their ability to interact with biological molecules. This rule applies to compounds labeled with "1" in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F) attached to an aromatic ring, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects. The presence of these functional groups may increase the reactivity of the compound and lead to toxic reactions in the body.
Example: C1C(=O)NC2=C(C=C(C=C2)[N+](=O)[O-])C(=N1)C3=CC=CC=C3Cl 1
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and a phosphorus atom bonded to two oxygen atoms through a double bond (P=O), then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects. This type of chemical structure is commonly found in organophosphorus compounds, which have been known to be highly toxic to living organisms.
Example: CC(O)(P(=O)(O)O)P(=O)(O)O 1
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a lithium ion (Li+) and two negatively charged oxygen atoms (O-), then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects. Lithium salts such as lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) are used in medicine for treating mental disorders but can also cause serious side effects if taken in excess.
Example: [Li+].[Li+].C(=O)([O-])[O-] 1

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in a molecule has been linked to toxicity and adverse reactions. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for potential risks before being used in clinical settings.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule can also affect its ability to interact with biological systems and potentially cause adverse effects. Molecules that are too large or have a non-optimal shape may not be able to penetrate cell membranes or bind effectively to target receptors, leading to reduced efficacy or off-target interactions. Therefore, molecules with inappropriate sizes or shapes should be avoided or used cautiously.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule can also play a role in determining its biological activity and potential adverse effects. For example, some drugs exist as enantiomers (mirror image isomers) that can have different pharmacological activities and toxicities. Therefore, it is important to consider the stereochemical configuration of a molecule when evaluating its safety and efficacy.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it may have side effects. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains two cyano groups.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carboxylate ion (-COO-), then it may not have side effects. The second molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a carboxylate ion.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a guanidine group (-C(=NH)NH2), then it may have side effects. The third molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a guanidine group.
Note that these rules are just examples and should not be considered definitive. It's important to conduct further research and testing before making any conclusions about the safety of specific molecules.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of nitro group (-NO2) in the structure may increase the probability of causing adverse effects. This is because nitro groups are known to be toxic and can cause damage to cells. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should be carefully investigated for their potential side-effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or bromine may also have a higher chance of causing adverse effects due to their ability to react with other molecules in the body. However, further research is needed to determine if there is a direct correlation between the number and type of halogen atoms present in a molecule and its toxicity.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of the carbon chain in a molecule may also play a role in determining its toxicity. Longer chains may make the molecule more difficult to metabolize and eliminate from the body, leading to accumulation and increased risk of adverse effects. Additionally, molecules with multiple rings or complex structures may also pose a greater risk of toxicity due to their ability to interact with biological systems in unique ways.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a sulfonamide group in the first SMILES string suggests that this molecule could have antimicrobial activity and potentially cause adverse reactions such as hypersensitivity or cross-reactivity with other drugs. Similarly, the presence of a nitro group in the second SMILES string indicates potential toxicity and carcinogenicity.
Rule 2: The molecular structure and geometry play a crucial role in determining the biological activity of a molecule. For instance, the third SMILES string contains a sulfonyl group attached to a benzene ring, which is known to be toxic and carcinogenic. Additionally, the fourth SMILES string has a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, which makes it more reactive and likely to interact with other molecules in the body.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule also affects its biological activity. For example, the fifth SMILES string contains a chiral center, which means that it exists in two different forms called enantiomers. One enantiomer may have therapeutic benefits while the other may be harmful or even toxic. Therefore, it is important to consider the stereochemical configuration when predicting the potential adverse effects of a molecule.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as C=O, COOH, or CN, then it may have potential side effects. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the dataset. For example, the first molecule in the list contains a carbonyl group (C=O) which suggests that it may have potential side effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5) or other aromatic rings, then it may also have potential side effects. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the dataset. For example, the third molecule in the list contains two fluorine atoms attached to a phenyl ring (C6H5F) which suggests that it may have potential side effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to at least one carbon atom, then it may have potential side effects. This rule applies to molecules labeled as either 0 or 1 in the dataset. For example, the thirteenth molecule in the list contains a pyridine ring (C5H5N) which suggests that it may have potential side effects.

This rule also applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the provided dataset. For example, the third compound listed in the dataset contains a pyridazine moiety, which suggests it may have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene or alkyne group, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the provided dataset. For example, the sixth compound listed in the dataset contains a dienone moiety, which suggests it
