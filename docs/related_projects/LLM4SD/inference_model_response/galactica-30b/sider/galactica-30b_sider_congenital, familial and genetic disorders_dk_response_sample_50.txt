Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects if they interact with biological systems in ways that disrupt normal function or lead to toxicity. For example, the nitro group (-NO2) present in the first SMILES string could be potentially toxic due to its ability to form reactive oxygen species upon reduction by cellular enzymes. Similarly, the phosphate group (-OPO3H2) found in the second SMILES string is known to have high reactivity and can interfere with various biochemical processes. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for potential safety concerns.
Rule 2: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound can also affect its ability to cross cell membranes and reach target sites within the body. Molecules with higher molecular weights and greater hydrophobicities tend to have lower aqueous solubility and may accumulate in lipid-rich tissues such as the brain or liver. This can lead to increased exposure and potential toxicity. Therefore, compounds with these characteristics should be given careful consideration when evaluating their potential safety profiles.
Rule 3: The structure and stereochemistry of a molecule can play a significant role in determining its biological activity and potential safety risks. For instance, the third SMILES string contains a carbamate group (-CONHC-) which is commonly used in pesticides and other industrial chemicals but has been associated with neurotoxicity and developmental toxicity. Additionally, the fourth SMILES string features a chiral center (marked by the asterisk) which can give rise to different enantiomers with distinct biological activities and toxicities. Therefore, it is important to consider the three-dimensional structure and stereochemistry of a molecule when assessing its potential safety risks.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any functional group such as carbonyl or carboxylic acid present in the structure, then it may lead to adverse effects. The presence of these groups increases the reactivity of the compound which may interact with other molecules leading to toxicity. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: If the molecular weight of the compound is high, then it may also lead to adverse effects due to its increased hydrophobicity. Hydrophobic compounds tend to accumulate in lipid membranes causing damage to cells. Hence, compounds with higher molecular weights should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxic effects.
Rule 3: Compounds containing aromatic rings have been shown to exhibit toxic effects on living organisms. These compounds can bind to proteins and enzymes resulting in disruption of normal cellular processes. Therefore, compounds containing aromatic rings should be used cautiously unless they are essential for the desired biological activity.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as fluorine atoms or nitro groups in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on human health. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled with 1 in the dataset. For example, FS(F)(F)(F)(F)F has five fluorine atoms which may contribute to its ability to cause adverse effects. Similarly, CNC1=C(C=C(C=C1)C2=NC3=C(S2)C=C(C=C3)O)F also contains a fluorine atom which may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a heterocyclic ring structure may have a higher probability of causing adverse effects compared to one without such a structure. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled with either 0 or 1 in the dataset. For instance, CC1C(C(CC(O1)OC2CC(CC3=C(C4=C(C(=C23)O)C(=O)C5=C(C4=O)C=CC=C5OC)O)(C(=O)C)O)N)O contains a heterocyclic ring structure formed by the fusion of two six-membered rings, which may make it more likely to cause adverse effects. On the other hand, C[C@H]1[C@@H]([C@@](C[C@@H](O1)O[C@H]2[C@H]3C(=O)N[C@H](C4=CC(=CC(=C4C5=C(C=CC(=C5)[C@H](C(=O)N3)NC(=O)[C@H]6C7=CC(=C(C(=C7)OC8=C(C=C(C=C8)[C@H]([C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N6)CC(=O)N)NC(=O)[C@@H](CC(C)C)NC)O)Cl)O[C@H]9[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O9)CO)O)O)O[C@H]1C[C@]([C@H]([C@@H](O1)C)O)(C)NCC1=CC=C(C=C1)C1=CC=C(

This rule applies to molecules represented by the third SMILES string labeled as 0 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains the substructure "C(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)Oc2ccc(cc2)n3ccnc(cn3)o4oc(co5ccc(cc5)nn6cc(ccc6)no7ccc(cc7)n8ccc(cc8)n9ccc(cc9)n%10ccc(cc%10)n%11ccc(cc%11)n%12ccc(cc%12)n%13ccc(cc%13)n%14ccc(cc%14)n%15ccc(cc%15)n%16ccc(cc%16)n%17ccc(cc%17)n%18ccc(cc%18)n%19ccc(cc%19)n%20ccc(cc%20)n%21ccc(cc%21)n%22ccc(cc%22)n%23ccc(cc%

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels of 0 indicating that they do not cause any known adverse effects. However, further research would need to be done to confirm this hypothesis.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. The third molecule in the dataset contains such a bond and it has a label of 0 indicating that it does not cause any known adverse effects. Again, more research would need to be done to confirm this hypothesis.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. The sixth molecule in the dataset contains such a system and it has a label of 0 indicating that it does not cause any known adverse effects. This rule is supported by previous studies which have shown that compounds containing conjugated systems of double bonds tend to be more reactive and potentially toxic than those without them.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group called "carbonyl" (represented by the symbol "C=O" in the SMILES notation), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by the first two SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a functional group called "nitrile" (represented by the symbol "#CN" or "C#N" in the SMILES notation), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by the third SMILES string labeled as 1 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a functional group called "sulfonamide" (represented by the symbols "SO2NH" or "SNHNSO2" in the SMILES notation), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by the last four SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the dataset.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a bromine atom, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. The presence of this element in the molecular structure suggests that it may interact with biological systems in ways that could lead to negative health outcomes.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. Fluorine is similar in size to chlorine but more electronegative, which can affect the electronic distribution within the molecule and potentially alter its reactivity or binding affinity towards biological targets.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease. Cyano groups are known to interfere with normal cellular processes by disrupting protein function or altering enzyme activity, and they have been linked to various types of neurotoxicity.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any occurrence of the SMILES string "CC#N" or "Cc1ccccc1" in the molecular structure, then it may cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial and genetic disorders.
Explanation: The SMILES strings "CC#N" and "Cc1ccccc1" represent a carbon-nitrogen double bond and a cyclopentane ring respectively. These structures are commonly found in drugs used for treating diseases such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and thalassemia. These diseases are known to be caused by mutations in genes that affect the production of proteins involved in ion transport across membranes, oxygen binding, and hemoglobin synthesis. Therefore, molecules containing these structures may have the potential to interact with these mutated proteins and restore their function, leading to therapeutic benefits. However, these same interactions could also lead to adverse effects if they disrupt normal protein functions.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial and genetic disorders.
Explanation: Nitro groups are known to be toxic and carcinogenic due to their ability to form reactive intermediates upon reduction. They are often present in pesticides, explosives, and industrial chemicals. Molecules containing nitro groups attached to aromatic rings may undergo metabolic activation to form electrophilic species that can bind to DNA and other macromolecules, leading to mutagenesis and carcinogenesis.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial and genetic disorders.
Explanation: Sulfonamides are antibiotics that inhibit bacterial growth by competing with p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) for incorporation into folic acid. Bacteria require folic acid for DNA synthesis and repair, so inhibition of its biosynthesis leads to cell death. However, some bacteria have evolved resistance to sulfonamides through various mechanisms, including mutation of the gene encoding dihydropteroate synthase, which catalyzes the conversion of PABA to dihydrofolate. Therefore, molecules containing sulfonamide groups may have the potential to select for resistant strains of bacteria in the gut microbiome.

This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C(CNCCNCCN)N, C1=NC(=O)NC(=C1F)N, CCN(CC)C(=O)[C@@]1(C[C@@H]1C[NH3+])C2=CC=CC=C2.[Cl-], C1=CC=C(C=C1)NC(=O)CCCCCCC(=O)NO, C1C2CC3CC1CC(C2)(C3)N, CCCC(C)(CC=C[C@H]1[C@@H](CC(=O)[C@@H]1CCCCCCC(=O)OC)O)O, CON=C1CN(CC1CN)C2=C(C=C3C(=O)C(=CN(C3=N2)C4CC4)C(=O)O)F, CC(C)CC(C(=O)NC(CCCN=C(N)N)C(=O)N1CC

================================

Rule 1: If there exists any functional group such as "-CC-" or "-CH=CH-" in the molecular structure, then it may lead to potential adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules with labels 1 for SMILES strings CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C3(C(CC2(C1(C(=O)CCl)OC(=O)C5=CC=CO5)C)O)Cl)C, C1C(C(C(C(C1N)OC2C(C(C(C(O2)CO)O)N)O)O)OC3C(CC(C(O3)CN)O)N)N, COC1=C(C(=NC=C1)CS(=O)C2=NC3=C(N2)C=C(C=C3)OC(F)F)OC, CN(C)CCC=C1C2=CC=CC=C2CCC3=CC=CC=C31, CNS(=O)(=O)CC1=CC2=C(C=C1)NC=C2CCN(C)C, CCCCCCCCCCCNCC=C.C[N+](C)(C)CCCCCCNCC=C.C=CCN.C1C(O1)CCl.Cl.[Cl-], CCS(=O)(=O

================================

Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as "CC(=O)OC1=CC2=C(S1)CCN(C2)C(C3=CC=CC=C3F)C(=O)C4CC4" or "CCCNN(Cc1ccccc1)C" then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in patients who have congenital, familial and genetic disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a functional group such as "C=CC(CCC(=O)O)N" or "CCSCN" then it may not be associated with any adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a functional group such as "CC(C)NC1=C(N=CC=C1)N2CCN(CC2)C(=O)C3=CC4=C(N3)C=CC(=C4)NS(=O)(=O)C" or "CC(=O)OCC(=O)C1(CCC2C1(CC(C3C2CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC34C)O)C)O" then it has a higher chance of being associated with adverse effects in patients who have congenital, familial and genetic disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure:

Rule 3: If a compound contains a coumarin ring system (-C9H6O2-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cancer or other diseases. This rule applies to the fifth SMILES string in the dataset.
It's important to note that these rules are just suggestions based on the limited information provided in the dataset. Further research and testing would be needed to confirm their validity.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as "-CCl" or "-SCN", then it may have adverse effects on the body. This rule applies to molecules in rows 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. This rule applies to molecules such as CC(C)NC(=O)C1=CC=C(C=C1)CNNC and C1CC2=C(C=CC(=C2)Cl)C(=C3CCNCC3)C4=C1C=CC=N4.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a quinolone ring system, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. This rule applies to molecules such as CC[C@@]1(C[C@H]2C[C@@](C3=C(CCN(C2)C1)C4=CC=CC=C4N3)(C5=C(C=C6C(=C5)[C@]78CCN9[C@H]7[C@@](C=CC9)([C@H]([C@@]([C@@H]8N6C)(C(=O)OC)O)OC(=O)C)CC)OC)C(=O)OC)O and CCC(=O)OC1CCC2C1(CCC3C2C=C(C4=CC(=O)C5CC5C34C)Cl)C.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. This rule applies to molecules such as CN(CC

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as fluorine (-F), chlorine (-Cl), bromine (-Br) or iodine (-I) in a compound may increase its toxicity. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule also play important roles in determining its biological activity. Molecules with bulky structures or those that are too flexible may have difficulty penetrating cell membranes and interacting with target proteins. On the other hand, molecules with compact shapes and rigid structures may have higher binding affinities towards their targets but may also exhibit lower selectivity due to their ability to bind to multiple receptors. Therefore, the balance between molecular flexibility and rigidity must be considered when designing new drugs.
Rule 3: The charge on a molecule can affect its solubility and bioavailability. Neutral compounds tend to be more soluble than charged ones, which can lead to better absorption and distribution throughout the body. However, neutral compounds may also be less selective towards specific targets compared to charged species. Therefore, the choice of charge state depends on the desired pharmacokinetic profile of the drug candidate.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a sulfonamide group present in the structure of the molecule, then it may have side effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. The presence of this functional group may interfere with the body's normal functioning, leading to these types of disorders. Therefore, molecules containing this group should be labeled as having potential side effects associated with them.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may not have any significant side effects. Fluorine is known for its stability and inertness, so it is unlikely to interact with other parts of the molecule or the body in any harmful way. Therefore, molecules without fluorine atoms should be labeled as potentially causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule has a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a nitrogen atom, then it may have side effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. This functional group is known to be reactive and can form hydrogen bonds with other molecules, which can lead to interference with their normal function. Therefore, molecules containing this group should be labeled as having potential side effects associated with them.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in patients who have a history of allergies or asthma. This rule applies to molecules 7, 8, 9, and 10.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in patients who have a history of liver disease or kidney problems. This rule applies to molecules 11 and 12.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in patients who have a history of thyroid disease or other hormonal imbalances. This rule applies to molecules 13 and 14.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in humans based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group called isocyanate (-N=C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in humans. This rule applies to molecules 9, 10, and 11.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in humans. This rule applies to molecules 12, 13, and 14.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in humans. This rule applies to molecule 15.
It's important to note that these rules are just suggestions and should not be used as the only criteria for predicting adverse effects in humans. It's always best to consult with experts in the field before making any decisions about the safety of a particular compound.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a phosphate group (PO4R), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 in the provided dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2) or an aromatic ring system, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide, nitro, or halogen groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects. These groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles.
Rule 2: Compounds with a high degree of lipophilicity tend to have higher chances of crossing cell membranes and interacting with intracellular targets. This property can lead to increased toxicity and adverse effects. Therefore, compounds with low solubility in water should be avoided or used with caution.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a compound's structure can also affect its ability to cross cell membranes and reach target sites. Longer and more complex structures may require active transport mechanisms to enter cells, which can limit their bioavailability and increase their potential for adverse effects. Therefore, simpler and shorter structures may be preferred when designing new drugs.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in a five-membered ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. The presence of this functional group in the molecule may increase its reactivity and ability to interact with biological systems, which could lead to negative health outcomes.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a cyclopropane ring, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. This functional group is known for its high reactivity and ability to form covalent bonds with other molecules, which could interfere with normal cellular processes and lead to negative health outcomes.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. This functional group is commonly found in many toxic compounds and is known for its ability to disrupt normal metabolic pathways and cause damage to cells and tissues.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it is likely to have side-effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a thiocarbonyl group (-CS-), then it is unlikely to have any side-effects related to these types of disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) adjacent to a double bond (represented by two consecutive letters in the SMILES string), then it may have side-effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. However, this rule should be applied cautiously since there may be other factors involved in determining if a molecule will actually cause such side-effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as both "1" and "0" in the dataset.

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in humans. However, this rule should be applied cautiously since some nitro compounds are known to be safe and even beneficial to human health. The second molecule in the dataset contains this functional group but has been labeled as not having the potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains both a chlorine atom and a carbonyl group (-C=O), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in humans. This rule is based on the third molecule in the dataset which contains these functional groups and has been labeled as having the potential for causing adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure:

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in individuals with congenital, familial or genetic disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains iron atoms, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in individuals with these types of disorders. The presence of iron atoms in a molecule can increase its reactivity and ability to interact with other molecules, which could lead to negative health outcomes.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a cyclic structure with multiple double bonds, such as the one found in the second molecule in the dataset, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in individuals with these types of disorders. This type of structure can make the molecule more reactive and able to interact with other molecules in ways that could harm cells or tissues.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group, such as the one found in the last molecule in the dataset, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in individuals with these types of disorders. Sulfonyl groups can be toxic and can interfere with normal cell function, leading to negative health outcomes.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The molecules in the dataset that contain these groups are C1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=NC(C(=O)NC3=C2C=C(C=C3)Cl)C(=O)O, CC(C)[C@H](CC1=CC(=C(C=C1)OC)OCCCOC)C[C@@H]([C@H](C[C@@H](C(C)C)C(=O)NCC(C)(C)C(=O)N)O)N, CS(=O)(=O)C1=CC(=C(C=C1)C(=O)NC2=CC(=C(C=C2)Cl)C3=CC=CC=N3)Cl, CCC(=O)NC[C@@H]1C[C@@H]1C2=C3CCOC3=CC=C2, CN(CC(CO)O)C(=O)C1=C(C(=

================================

Rule 1: If there is any functional group such as "CCOO" or "CCON" in the molecular structure, then it may have potential side effects on congenital, familial and genetic disorders. The presence of these groups indicates that the compound has high lipophilicity which makes it easier for the molecule to cross cell membranes and interact with biological systems. This could lead to negative health outcomes if the concentration of the substance exceeds its safe limit.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains aromatic rings like "CC1=NN=C(C=C1)C" or "CC1=NN=C(CS1)C", they may also contribute to the risk of causing adverse effects due to their ability to bind to receptors and disrupt normal cellular processes. These types of structures are often associated with toxicity and carcinogenicity.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains multiple halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine, it may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects by altering the chemical and physical properties of the molecule. Halogenated compounds tend to be more reactive than non-halogenated ones and can interfere with various metabolic pathways within the body. However, this rule should be applied cautiously since some halogenated compounds are used as pharmaceuticals and have been shown to have beneficial effects at low concentrations.
