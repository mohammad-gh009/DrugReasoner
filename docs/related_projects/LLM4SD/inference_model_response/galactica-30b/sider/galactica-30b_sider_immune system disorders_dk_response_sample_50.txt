Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules labeled with "1" in the dataset. For example, in the first row of the dataset, the molecule contains iodine, which is also a halogen atom.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules labeled with "1" in the dataset. For example, in the second row of the dataset, the molecule contains a sulfonamide group.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules labeled with "1" in the dataset. For example, in the third row of the dataset, the molecule contains a nitro group.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system. This rule applies to compounds #2 and #4 which have a nitro group attached to their structures.
Rule 2: Compounds containing a sulfonamide functional group (-SO2NH2) may also increase the risk of adverse effects on the immune system. This rule applies to compound #1 whose structure contains a sulfonamide group.
Rule 3: The absence of certain functional groups or atoms in a compound may decrease its potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system. For example, compounds #3 and #5 do not contain any nitro or sulfonamide groups but still do not exhibit any adverse effects. Therefore, these two compounds may be considered safe for use.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system. For example, the carbonyl group (C=O) present in the first SMILES string could be responsible for the observed side-effects. Similarly, the carboxylic acid group (COOH) and the amide group (CONH) present in the second and third SMILES strings respectively, could also contribute to their toxicity.
Rule 2: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a molecule may also play a role in determining its potential to cause adverse effects. Molecules with higher molecular weights and greater hydrophobicities tend to have longer half-lives and are more likely to accumulate in tissues, leading to toxic effects. This could explain why the fourth SMILES string contains a long carbon chain and the fifth SMILES string has two benzene rings.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule can also affect its biological activity. The sixth SMILES string shows that the configuration of the double bond between C1 and C2 affects the orientation of the rest of the molecule, which could impact its ability to interact with target molecules or enzymes. Additionally, the seventh SMILES string demonstrates how the position of substituents on a ring can influence its bioactivity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to immune system disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a benzene ring (-C6H5), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The first example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains both these functional groups.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a pyridine ring (-C5H5N), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The second example in the dataset satisfies this rule as well.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a ferrocene group (-Fe(C5H5)2) or a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to a carbon atom that is part of a conjugated system containing multiple double bonds, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The third example in the dataset violates this rule since it does not contain any such functional groups.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three possible rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to the immune system disorder. The first two molecules in the dataset contain this functional group and they both have label 1 indicating their association with such adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to the immune system disorder. The third molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and it also has label 1 indicating its association with such adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine or chlorine) attached to a carbon atom, then it may not have the potential to cause any adverse effects. The fourth and fifth molecules in the dataset contain these types of atoms and they both have label 0 indicating no association with adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system. For example, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) in a molecule may increase its potential for causing allergic reactions and other immune system disorders.
Rule 2: The molecular structure and geometry of a compound play a crucial role in determining its biological activity. A molecule with a linear shape or a rigid structure may be less likely to cross cell membranes and interact with target receptors compared to a flexible molecule with a curved shape. Therefore, molecules with a more flexible structure may have a higher probability of causing adverse effects on the immune system.
Rule 3: The size and polarity of a molecule also affect its ability to penetrate cell membranes and bind to target receptors. Small polar molecules may easily pass through cell membranes but may lack specificity towards specific targets, while larger nonpolar molecules may have lower permeability but may have greater affinity for specific targets. Therefore, compounds with intermediate sizes and moderate polarity may have the highest potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) and amide group (-CONH-) in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system. These functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions.
Rule 2: A molecule containing halogen atoms such as fluorine or chlorine may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects due to their electronegativity and ability to form hydrogen bonds with other molecules. This can affect the binding affinity between ligands and receptors, leading to altered signaling pathways and cellular responses.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure may also play a role in determining its toxicity. Longer chains of carbon atoms and more complex branching patterns can make it harder for the body to break down and eliminate the molecule, increasing the likelihood of accumulation and adverse effects. Additionally, the presence of multiple rings or aromatic structures can enhance the stability of the molecule and increase its resistance to degradation.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and carboxylic acid in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system.
Rule 2: A compound containing multiple rings or aromatic systems may have higher chances of causing adverse effects compared to those without them.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a compound's structure may also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects. Compounds with longer chains or more complex structures may be harder to metabolize and eliminate from the body, leading to accumulation and increased toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system. For example, molecules containing nitro groups or halogen atoms such as chlorine and fluorine have been shown to be associated with increased risk of immune system disorders. Therefore, if a molecule contains these functional groups, it should be labeled as having label 1 (related to immune system disorders).
Rule 2: The molecular structure and size may also play a role in determining the likelihood of a molecule causing adverse effects. Molecules with larger structures and more complex shapes may be less likely to cross cell membranes and interact with target receptors, leading to reduced toxicity. Therefore, smaller molecules with simpler structures may be more likely to cause adverse effects than larger ones. However, this rule is not absolute and other factors such as concentration and exposure time must also be considered.
Rule 3: The presence of specific chemical bonds or structural motifs may also affect the ability of a molecule to cause adverse effects. For instance, molecules containing sulfur-sulfur bonds or conjugated double bonds may exhibit higher reactivity and potency compared to those without them. Therefore, if a molecule contains these features, it should be labeled as having label 1 (related to immune system disorders).

================================

Rule 1: The presence of negatively charged ions such as calcium or chlorine in the structure may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a nitro group (-NO2) and a benzene ring may have a higher chance of causing adverse effects on the immune system.
Rule 3: A molecule having a sulfonamide functional group (-SO2NH2) may be associated with allergic reactions and should be carefully evaluated for potential adverse effects on the immune system.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to immune system disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C[C@@H](CC1=CC=CC=C1)NC(=O)[C@H](CCCCN)N.CS(=O)(=O)O.CS(=O)(=O)O and CC1=C(C=C(C=C1)N2C(=O)C(=C(N2)C)N/N=C/3\C=CC=C(C3=O)C4=CC(=CC=C4)C(=O)O)C.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a pyridine ring (-C5H4N-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CN1CCN(CC1)CCCOC2=C(C=C3C(=C2)N=CC(=C3NC4=CC(=C(C=C4Cl)Cl)OC)C#N)OC.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a thiazole ring (-C3H3NS-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CCC(=O)NC[C@@H]1C[C@@H]1C2=C3CCOC3=CC=C2 and CNS(=O)(=O)CCC1=CC2=C(C=C1)NC=C2C3CCN(CC3)C.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to immune system disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains the substructure "CCS(=O)(=O)O" or "CC(=O)NN", then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains the substructure "CCCC1OC2CC3C4CCC5=CC(=O)C=CC5(C4C(CC3(C2(O1)C(=O)CO)C)O)C" or "CC(C)(C(=O)O)OC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)C2=CC=C(C=C2)Cl", then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 0 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains the substructure "COC1=CC2=C(C=CN=C2C=C1OC)OC3=CC=C(C=C3)NC(=O)C4(CC4)C(=O)NC5=CC=C(C=C5)F" or "C1CCC(CC1)C(CC2CCCCN2)C3CCCCC3", then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. However, this rule should be used cautiously and further testing would be needed to confirm its accuracy. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system. This is because the nitro group can react with other molecules and disrupt their normal function. Therefore, compounds containing this functional group should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: Compounds containing a sulfonate group (-SO3-) or sulfate group (-OSO3-) may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects on the immune system due to their ability to bind to proteins and alter their structure and function. Therefore, these groups should also be avoided when designing new drugs.
Rule 3: Compounds containing chlorine atoms may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system as well. Chlorine atoms can act as electron-withdrawing groups, which can change the electronic properties of nearby atoms and affect their reactivity. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the placement of chlorine atoms in potential drug candidates.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to immune system disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and a bromine atom (Br), then it may have side-effects related to immune system disorders. The first example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains both these functional groups.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms (=NN=C), then it may also have side-effects related to immune system disorders. The second example in the dataset satisfies this rule.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a sulfur atom bonded to one carbon atom (-SC-), then it may also have side-effects related to immune system disorders. The third example in the dataset satisfies this rule.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects on the immune system. The presence of these functional groups may increase the reactivity of the molecule and lead to toxic reactions in the body.
Example: Molecule 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 have both a nitro group and a halogen atom, so they are likely to be associated with adverse effects on the immune system.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it also has a high probability of causing adverse effects on the immune system. Sulfonamides are known to have antimicrobial properties, but they can also cause allergic reactions in some individuals.
Example: Molecule 16 has a sulfonamide group, so it is likely to be associated with adverse effects on the immune system.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, then it may also contribute to its ability to cause adverse effects on the immune system. Benzene is a known carcinogen and can disrupt normal cell growth and division.
Example: Molecule 17 has a benzene ring, so it is likely to be associated with adverse effects on the immune system.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system. This rule can be applied to molecules such as CCC1C(C(C(C(=NOCOCCOC)C(CC(C(C(C(C(C(=O)O1)C)OC2CC(C(C(O2)C)O)(C)OC)C)OC3C(C(CC(O3)C)N(C)C)O)(C)O)C)C)O)(C)O and C1=CC=C(C=C1)NS(=O)(=O)C2=CC=CC(=C2)/C=C/C(=O)NO.
Rule 2: A compound containing a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) may have the potential to cause adverse effects on the immune system. This rule can be applied to molecules such as CC1(C(N2C(S1)C(C2=O)NC(=O)C(C3=CC=CC=C3)N)C(=O)[O-])C and C1CC(N(C1)C(=O)C2CSSCCC(=O)NC(C(=O)NC(C(=O)NC(C(=O)NC(C(=O)N2)CC(=O)N)CCC(=O)N)CC3=CC=CC=C3)CC4=CC=C(C=C4)O)C(=O)NC(CCCN=C(N)N)C(=O)NCC(=O)N.
Rule

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to immune system disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a bromine atom and a benzene ring, then it is likely to have side-effects related to immune system disorders. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule and has been labeled as having such side-effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom, a carbonyl group, and a cyclopropane ring, then it is highly likely to have side-effects related to immune system disorders. The second molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule and has also been labeled as having such side-effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom, a nitrogen atom, and a conjugated double bond system, then it may have some potential for causing adverse effects related to immune system disorders. However, this is a less certain prediction than Rules 1 and 2, since only one molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule but has not yet been labeled for its side-effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to immune system disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The first example in the dataset, C(C(CS)S)O, contains both groups and has been labeled as having such potential.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a fluoro substituent (-F) at position 2 of a benzene ring, which is attached to a pyrazole ring through a nitrogen atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The second example in the dataset, CC1CN(CCN1)C2=C(C=C3C(=C2OC)N(C=C(C3=O)C(=O)O)C4CC4)F, satisfies this condition and has also been labeled as having such potential.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a guanidine group (-C(NH2)2) or a urea group (-CONH-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The third example in the dataset, C[N+](C)(C)CCO, contains a guanidine group and has been labeled as having such potential.

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to immune system disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have side-effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 9 and 10 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a double bond, then it may have side-effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 11 and 12 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrile group (-CN) followed by a benzene ring, then it may have side-effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecule number 13 in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of sulfur in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system. This rule can be inferred from the second and third molecules listed in the dataset where the first one does not contain any sulfur while the other two do. Both of these compounds have been labeled as having adverse effects on the immune system.
Rule 2: Compounds containing conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings may also increase their chances of causing adverse effects on the immune system. This rule can be inferred from the fourth and fifth molecules listed in the dataset where both of them contain such structures but only the former has been labeled as having adverse effects on the immune system.
Rule 3: The presence of certain functional groups like nitro groups, sulfonyl groups etc. may also increase the probability of a compound causing adverse effects on the immune system. However, this rule cannot be conclusively drawn from the given dataset since there are no examples of such compounds present in the list.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to immune system disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a benzene ring (-C6H5), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains both these functional groups.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a pyridine ring (-C5H5N), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The third molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains both these functional groups.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains two amide groups (-CONH-) connected by a single bond, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The sixth molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains such a structure.

================================

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or its derivatives, it may have potential side effects on the immune system. However, this rule cannot be applied to the given SMILES string since it does not contain any such groups.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom like chlorine (-Cl) attached to a benzene ring, it may have potential side effects on the immune system. This rule applies to the given SMILES string which contains a chlorine atom connected to a phenyl ring and has been labeled as having side-effects on the immune system.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings "CS(=O)(=O)O" and "CC(=O)OCC(=O)[C@]1(CC[C@@H]2[C@@]1(C[C@@H]([C@H]3[C@H]2CCC4=CC(=O)C=C[C@]34C)O)C)O" respectively.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES string "CNN1CCN(CC1)CCCOC2=C(C=C3C(=C2)N=CC(=C3NC4=CC(=C(C=C4Cl)Cl)OC)C#N)OC".
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a positively charged nitrogen atom (-NH+-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES string "C[N+](C

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to its structure and properties:
1. If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to the immune system disorder. This rule applies to molecules C17, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C13, C14, C15, C16, and C18.
2. If the molecule contains a metal ion such as gadolinium (Gd), sodium (Na), or gold (Au), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to their toxic nature. This rule applies to molecules C1, C2, and C3.
3. If the molecule contains a conjugated system consisting of alternating single and double bonds, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to the immune system disorder. This rule applies to molecules C4, C5, C6, C7, C19, C20, C21, C22, C23, C24, C25, and C26.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to the immune system disorder. This rule applies to molecules 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 8

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and has a molecular weight less than or equal to 500 Daltons, then it may have potential side effects on the immune system. The first two molecules in the table contain this functional group and have labels indicating their possible relation to immune system disorders. However, this rule should be used as a general guideline and not as a definitive predictor of side effects.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a nitro group (NO2), then it may have potential side effects on the immune system. The third molecule in the table contains this functional group but does not have any information about its relationship to immune system disorders. Therefore, further research would be needed to determine if this compound could cause such side effects.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) attached to a carbon atom, then it may have potential side effects on the immune system. The sixth molecule in the table contains a chlorine atom and has a label indicating its possible relation to immune system disorders. Again, this rule should be used as a general guideline and not as a definitive predictor of side effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system. For example, the presence of carbonyl group (C=O) and double bond (C=C) in the given SMILES strings suggests that they could be potential candidates for causing such effects. However, this rule alone cannot accurately predict if a particular molecule will have any adverse effects or not as other factors like dosage, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility also play a role.
Rule 2: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound can affect its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets. Therefore, molecules with higher molecular weights and hydrophobicities may have a greater chance of causing adverse effects due to their increased ability to penetrate cells and bind to proteins. This rule can help narrow down the list of potential candidate molecules but still requires further testing to confirm their safety.
Rule 3: The presence of specific chemical elements in a molecule can also influence its toxicity. For instance, lanthanum (La) is known to have toxic effects on the nervous system while silver (Ag) has antimicrobial properties but can also be toxic at high concentrations. Therefore, analyzing the elemental composition of a molecule can provide additional insights into its potential toxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a carbonyl group (COR), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and are labeled as having side-effect activity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a phosphorus atom bonded to four carbon atoms, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains this structural feature and is labeled as having no side-effect activity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a gold atom, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The fourth molecule in the dataset contains a gold atom and is labeled as having no side-effect activity.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three possible rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to the immune system disorder. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "CC12CC(C3C(C1CCC2(C(=O)CO)O)CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC34C)O 1", "C1=CC(=C(C(=C1)Cl)SC(CCC2=CC=C(C=C2)Cl)CN3C=CN=C3)Cl.[N+](=O)(O)[O-] 0", "COC1=CC(=CC(=C1OC)OC)C2C3C(COC3=O)C(C4=CC5=C(C=C24)OCO5)O 1", "C1C(C(OC1N2C=C(C(=O)NC2=O)F)CO)O 1", "CC(C)NCC(COC1=CC=CC2=CC=CC=C21)O 1"

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and halogenated compounds may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects in the immune system.
Explanation: Sulfonamide is known for its antimicrobial property but has also been associated with hypersensitivity reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Halogenated compounds like bromine or chlorine have been linked to allergic reactions due to their ability to bind to proteins and form haptens. Therefore, molecules containing these functional groups should be carefully evaluated for potential toxicity when used in therapy.
Rule 2: Molecules with a high degree of conjugation between multiple aromatic rings may also increase the risk of adverse effects.
Explanation: Conjugation increases the stability of the molecule by delocalizing electrons across multiple bonds. However, this increased stability may also lead to increased reactivity and interaction with biological systems. For example, quinolone antibiotics are known to cause hypersensitivity reactions due to their ability to cross-link DNA through intercalation and formation of covalent adducts.
Rule 3: The presence of charged functional groups such as ammonium ions or carboxylate anions may decrease the likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Explanation: Charged functional groups tend to repel each other and reduce intermolecular interactions. This reduces the probability of forming stable complexes with biomolecules and reducing the likelihood of adverse effects. On the other hand, neutral functional groups may interact more readily with surrounding molecules leading to higher chances of adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to negative consequences. For example, the sulfonyl group present in the first SMILES string has been shown to bind to receptors involved in insulin secretion, resulting in hypoglycemic episodes.
Rule 2: A compound containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or iodine may also increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects due to their electronegativity and ability to form hydrogen bonds.
Explanation: Halogen atoms can alter the electronic distribution within a molecule, affecting its reactivity and binding affinity towards target proteins. Additionally, they can form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues in enzymes and receptors, altering their catalytic activities and inducing unwanted responses.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a compound's structure may also play a role in determining its toxicity. Compounds with longer chains or more complex structures may have greater access to intracellular targets and be more likely to induce adverse effects.
Explanation: Longer chains or more complex structures may require more energy to break down or metabolize, increasing the risk of accumulation and toxic effects. Additionally, these structures may possess multiple reactive sites that can interact with various cellular components, leading to a range of negative outcomes.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system. For example, the molecules containing sulfonamide or nitro groups have been known to cause allergic reactions and other immune system disorders. Therefore, if a molecule contains such functional groups, it should be labeled as having a high likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system.
Rule 2: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a molecule also play important roles in determining its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological systems. Generally, larger and more hydrophobic molecules tend to have higher toxicity than smaller and less hydrophobic ones. Therefore, if a molecule has a relatively large size and high hydrophobicity, it should be labeled as having a moderate likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system.
Rule 3: The presence of specific structural features in a molecule may also affect its ability to bind to receptors and enzymes involved in various physiological processes. For instance, some studies have shown that the presence of aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds in a molecule can increase its affinity towards certain receptors and enzymes. Therefore, if a molecule contains these types of structures, it should be labeled as having a low likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to immune system disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 14.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a pyridine ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 21 and 22.
Note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the given dataset and should be treated as preliminary until further validated by experimental studies.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of fluorine in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system. This rule applies to the first SMILES string where there is a fluorine atom present in the structure.
Rule 2: A compound containing a sulfonyl group (SO2R) has the potential to cause adverse effects on the immune system if it is attached to another functional group such as a benzene ring or an aliphatic chain. This rule applies to the second SMILES string where the SO2R group is attached to a phenyl ring through an oxygen atom.
Rule 3: A compound containing a thiadiazole ring may have the potential to cause adverse effects on the immune system due to its ability to bind to biological molecules and disrupt their function. This rule applies to the third SMILES string where the thiadiazole ring is present in the structure.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfhydryl group (SH) or a disulfide bond (SS), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to their ability to bind to proteins and disrupt their function. The presence of these groups can also make the molecule more reactive and prone to oxidation. Therefore, molecules containing SH or SS should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects by reacting with other molecules and forming toxic compounds. Nitro groups can also increase the molecule's reactivity and hydrophobicity, which can affect its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties. Therefore, molecules containing NO2 should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its ability to interact with biological receptors and disrupt normal cellular processes. Benzene rings can also increase the molecule's lipophilicity, which can affect its ADME properties and lead to accumulation in tissues. Therefore, molecules containing benzene rings should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a chlorine atom in the molecular structure may indicate potential side effects on the immune system. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 and 8.
Rule 2: The presence of a conjugated double bond system in the molecular structure may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1, 9, and 10.
Rule 3: The absence of functional groups such as hydroxyl or amino groups in the molecular structure may decrease the likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 0, 11, and 12.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the first molecule listed in the dataset contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom and is labeled as "1" because it is known to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" in the dataset. For example, the second molecule listed in the dataset contains a sulfonamide group but is labeled as "0" because it is not known to cause any adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. This rule also applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the third molecule listed in the dataset contains a nitro group and is labeled as "1" because it is known to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as "CC" or "C=C" in conjugation with other groups like "C=O" and "C-OH", then there is a high probability of causing adverse effects on the immune system. The presence of these conjugated systems increases the reactivity of the molecule, which may lead to interactions with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions.
Example: CC1=C(C(CCC1)(C)C)C=CC(=CC=CC(=CC(=O)O)C)C 1
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a heterocyclic ring system such as pyridine or pyrimidine, then it has a higher chance of causing adverse effects on the immune system. These rings have a high affinity for binding to biomolecules due to their polar nature and can interfere with their normal functioning.
Example: C1=CC=C(C=C1)CCNN 0
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains metal ions such as zinc or sodium, then they may contribute to the overall toxicity of the compound by disrupting cellular processes or altering the structural integrity of proteins. However, this rule should be used cautiously since the impact of metals on toxicity depends on various factors such as concentration, oxidation state, and chemical environment.
Example: [Zn] 0

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1C(O1)CCl.C(CNCCNCCNCCN)N CC1CN(CCN1)C2=C(C=C3C(=C2OC)N(C=C(C3=O)C(=O)O)C4CC4)F 1
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2) or a carbonyl group (CO), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CS(=O)C COCCCC(=O)O CCC(=O)OC1CCC2C1(CCC3C2CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C CCS(=O)C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)C2=C(C(=CC=C2)CC(=O)N)N CN1C2=C(C=C(C=C2)Cl)C(=NC(C1=O)O)C3=CC=CC=C

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as "-COOH" or "-OH", then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its ability to bind to proteins and disrupt their function. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be labeled as having the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its ability to interact with biological systems and disrupt normal cellular processes. Therefore, molecules containing this structural feature should also be labeled as having the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to at least two other atoms, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and participate in electrostatic interactions with biomolecules. Therefore, molecules containing this structural feature should also be labeled as having the potential to cause adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as nitro groups or halogen atoms in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system.
Explanation: These functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to negative consequences. For example, the nitro group present in the first SMILES string can act as an electron-withdrawing group, making the molecule more reactive and potentially toxic. Similarly, the chlorine atom in the seventh SMILES string can alter the electronic structure of the molecule and affect its binding affinity towards target proteins.
Rule 2: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure may also play a role in determining its toxicity. Compounds with longer chains or multiple rings may have greater flexibility and be able to bind to multiple targets, increasing their likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Example: The third SMILES string has a complex structure with multiple rings and double bonds, which may make it more likely to interact with biological molecules and cause harm.
Rule 3: The presence of certain chemical moieties, such as sulfonates or phosphates, may indicate that a compound could cause adverse effects on the immune system.
Example: The thirteenth SMILES string contains a sulfonate group, which can interfere with cellular processes and lead to inflammation or other harmful effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) and amide group (R-CONHR') in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to form hydrogen bonds with biological molecules, which can disrupt their normal functions and lead to toxicity.
Rule 2: A compound containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or bromine may also increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system.
Explanation: Halogen atoms can act as electron-withdrawing groups, which can alter the electronic structure of a compound and affect its reactivity and binding affinity towards biological targets.
Rule 3: Compounds containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also exhibit immunomodulatory activities due to their ability to interact with immune cells through π-π stacking interactions or covalent bonding.
Explanation: Aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds can provide a hydrophobic surface that can bind to receptors on immune cells and modulate their function.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to immune system disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a halogen atom such as fluorine or chlorine, then it may have side-effects related to immune system disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain this functional group and have been labeled as having side-effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a benzene ring, then it may also have side-effects related to immune system disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains both these features and has been labeled as having side-effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a conjugated double bond system, then it may also have side-effects related to immune system disorders. The fourth molecule in the dataset contains both these features and has been labeled as having side-effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as nitro group (-NO2) and halogen atoms like chlorine (Cl) in a molecule increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1. For example, in the first SMILES string, the presence of the nitro group (-NO2) and the chlorine atom (Cl) may increase the risk of immune system disorder.
Rule 2: The absence of certain functional groups or fragments in a molecule decreases its potential to cause adverse effects on the immune system. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 0. For instance, in the last SMILES string, the absence of any functional groups or fragments other than the cyano group (-CN) suggests that this molecule has a lower chance of causing adverse effects compared to those containing additional functional groups or fragments.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects on the immune system. Generally, longer and more complex molecules tend to have higher risks of causing adverse effects due to their increased reactivity and ability to interact with biological systems. However, this rule should be used cautiously since there are exceptions to this trend.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as nitro groups or aromatic rings in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, which could lead to negative consequences.
Rule 2: Molecules containing sulfur atoms may be more likely to cause adverse effects than those without them.
Explanation: Sulfur atoms have a high electron density and can form strong covalent bonds with other atoms, making them potentially reactive and toxic.
Rule 3: A molecule's size and shape may also play a role in determining its potential to cause adverse effects. For example, larger molecules may have greater steric hindrance and be less able to fit into target sites within the body.
Explanation: This rule is based on observations that some drugs with similar chemical structures can have different levels of toxicity depending on their size and shape.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders.

For example, the second molecule listed in the dataset contains a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom that is part of a ring structure and is labeled as "1" because it is known to cause immune system disorders. However, this rule does not apply to all molecules containing fluorines, as seen in the third molecule listed in the dataset which is labeled as "0" despite having a fluorine atom.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to a nitrogen atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" or "0" in

This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "C1C(=O)...", "C1NNC(=O)..", "C1ONC(=O)....", etc. For example, the first molecule in the list (with label 1) contains both a nitro group and a chlorine atom, while the second molecule (also with label 1) contains only a nitro group. The third molecule (with label 0) does not contain any nitro groups nor halogen atoms.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings containing "OS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(cc1)n2ccccc2", "SS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(cc1)n2ccccc2", etc. For example, the fourth molecule in the list (with label 1) contains two sulf
