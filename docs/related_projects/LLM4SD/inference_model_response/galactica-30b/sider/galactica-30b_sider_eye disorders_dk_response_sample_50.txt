Rule 1: The presence of bromine in the structure may indicate potential eye disorder side effects. This rule could be based on previous research showing that certain chemicals containing bromine can cause eye irritation and damage. However, this rule should only be used as a preliminary indicator and further testing would be necessary to confirm any potential side effects.
Rule 2: The presence of a conjugated system within the molecule may also indicate potential eye disorder side effects. Conjugated systems are characterized by alternating single and double bonds, which can increase the molecule's reactivity and ability to interact with other molecules. This rule could be based on previous research showing that some highly reactive compounds can cause eye irritation or damage. Again, however, this rule should be used cautiously and further testing would be necessary to confirm any potential side effects.
Rule 3: The absence of specific functional groups such as sulfonamide or nitro groups may indicate a lower likelihood of causing eye disorder side effects. These functional groups have been previously associated with adverse reactions in the eyes, so their absence may suggest a reduced risk of side effects. However, again, this rule should be used cautiously and further testing would be necessary to confirm any potential side effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a halogen atom in the structure may increase the likelihood of causing eye disorders as it can affect the permeability and absorption of the drug molecules through the cell membrane. Therefore, if there is any chlorine or bromine present in the molecular structure, it should be labeled as 1 for potential eye disorder activity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, it may increase its ability to interact with biological systems and potentially lead to adverse effects such as eye disorders. Therefore, if the molecule has a conjugated system of double bonds, it should also be labeled as 1 for potential eye disorder activity.
Rule 3: The presence of multiple carbonyl groups in the structure may increase the polarity of the molecule and enhance its interaction with biological membranes leading to increased toxicity. Therefore, if the molecule contains more than one carbonyl group, it should be labeled as 1 for potential eye disorder activity.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a cyano group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) in close proximity, then it may have potential side effects on eyes. The presence of these functional groups may increase the likelihood of causing eye disorders such as cataracts or macular degeneration.
Example: Label 1 for SMILES string "CCN(CC)C(=O)[C@@]1(C[C@@H]1C[NH3+])C2=CC=CC=C2.[Cl-]"
Rule 2: If the molecular structure has two aromatic rings connected by a nitrogen atom, then it may also have potential side effects on eyes. This type of structure may disrupt the normal function of proteins within the eye, leading to visual impairments.
Example: Label 1 for SMILES string "CC1=NC=CN1CC2CCC3=C(C2=O)C4=CC=CC=C4N3C 1"
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a conjugated system consisting of multiple double bonds and carbonyl groups, then it may be more likely to cause skin irritation upon exposure. This type of structure may interact with skin cells and cause inflammation or other adverse reactions.
Example: Label 0 for SMILES string "CC1=CC(=CC(=C1NC2=NC(=NC=C2)NC3=CC=C(C=C3)C#N)C)C=CC#N 0"

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders as a side effect:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders as a side effect. This is because these functional groups are commonly found in drugs that are known to cause eye irritation or damage. The first example in the dataset meets this rule.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl) and a nitrogen atom (N) in its structure, then it may also have the potential to cause eye disorders as a side effect. This is because Cl and N atoms are often present in pharmaceuticals that are known to irritate the eyes. The third example in the dataset meets this rule.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom (F) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders as a side effect. This is because F and C=O are both common features in drugs that are known to cause eye irritation or damage. The fifth example in the dataset meets this rule.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a negatively charged atom such as sodium or lithium, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies only to one molecule in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to two molecules in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to four molecules in the dataset.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided by this small dataset and should be used cautiously until further research can confirm their validity.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, nitro, and carbonyl groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on eyes. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 in this dataset. For example, the first molecule contains a sulfonyl group which is known to cause irritation and inflammation in the eyes.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects due to their ability to absorb light energy and generate reactive oxygen species. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 in this dataset. For instance, the third molecule has two phenyl rings connected through a conjugated system, making it more likely to interact with biological systems and potentially cause toxicity.
Rule 3: Molecules with a high degree of hydrophobicity may accumulate in lipid membranes and disrupt their function, leading to adverse effects. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as either 0 or 1 in this dataset. For example, the last molecule has a long carbon chain that makes it highly hydrophobic, increasing its potential to penetrate cell membranes and cause damage.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as C[N+](C)(C)CC or CC/C=C\C/C=C\C/C=C\C/C=C\C/C=C\CCCC, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a functional group such as CCC(C)C(C(=O)NC(CCC(=O)N)C(=O)NC(CC(C)C)C(=O)NC(CCSC)C(=O)NC(CC1=CNC=N1)C(=O)NC(CC(=O)N)C(=O)NC(CC(C)C)C(=O)NCC(=O)NC(CCCCN)C(=O)NC(CC2=CNC=N2)C(=O)NC(CC(C)C)C(=O)NC(CC(=O)N)C(=O)NC(CO)C(=O)NC(CCSC)C(=O)NC(CCC(=O)O)C(=O)NC(CCCNC(=N)N)

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) attached to the same carbon atom, then it has a high probability of causing eye disorders. The presence of these functional groups may increase the compound's ability to penetrate the eye tissue and cause damage.
Example: C1CNP(=O)(OC1)N(CCCl)CCCl 1
Rule 2: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) adjacent to a double bond in its structure, then it also has a high probability of causing eye disorders. This functional group may increase the compound's reactivity and make it more prone to react with other molecules within the eye tissue.
Example: CN1C(=O)CN=C(C2=C1C=CC(=C2)Cl)C3=CC=CC=C3 1
Rule 3: If a compound contains a cyclic structure with multiple rings, then it has a lower probability of causing eye disorders compared to compounds containing only one ring. This structural feature may reduce the compound's ability to penetrate the eye tissue due to its larger size and higher molecular weight.
Example: CC(C)[N+](C)(CCOC(=O)C1C2=CC=CC=C2OC3=CC=CC=C13)C(C)C 1

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have label 1 indicating their association with eye disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains halogen atoms such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine in its structure, then it may also have the potential to cause eye disorders. The third and fifth molecules in the dataset contain halogens and they both have label 1 indicating their association with eye disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a benzene ring in its structure, then it may also have the potential to cause eye disorders. The seventh molecule in the dataset contains a benzene ring and it has label 1 indicating its association with eye disorders.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of chlorine atom in the structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on eyes. The given SMILES string has a chlorine atom and hence it belongs to class 1.
Rule 2: If there is a presence of a functional group like "-COOH" or "-OH" attached to the carbon chain, then it may also contribute to the adverse effects on eyes. However, this rule cannot be applied for all cases as some molecules having these groups do not have any adverse effects. Therefore, further analysis needs to be done before making any conclusion based on this rule.
Rule 3: If the molecular weight of the compound is less than 500 Daltons, then it may have low solubility in water which leads to poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract resulting in lower bioavailability. This could potentially affect its efficacy and safety profile leading to potential adverse effects. However, again, this rule should only be used as a general guideline and not as a definitive predictor of toxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having the potential to cause eye disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have the potential to cause eye disorders. However, this rule should be used cautiously since there are other molecules in the dataset without this functional group but still labeled as having the potential to cause eye disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), then it may not have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule is based on the fact that the last two molecules in the dataset contain this functional group but have been labeled as not having the potential to cause eye disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a phosphorus atom bonded to four oxygen atoms in a cyclic structure, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain this structural feature and are labeled as having the potential to cause eye disorders (label 1).
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. The fourth molecule in the dataset contains this structural feature and is also labeled as having the potential to cause eye disorders (label 1).
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom and a carbonyl group (C=O), then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. The seventh molecule in the dataset contains this structural feature and is also labeled as having the potential to cause eye disorders (label 1).

================================

Rule 1: The presence of sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in a compound may increase its potential to cause eye disorders as seen in SMILES string "CCNC1CC(S(=O)(=O)C2=C1C=C(S2)S(=O)(=O)N)C 1" and "CS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(cc1Br)NS(=O)(=O)Nc2ccccc2". This rule should be used carefully since there could be other factors involved too.
Rule 2: The presence of chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring of a compound may decrease its potential to cause eye disorders as seen in SMILES strings "CC1(N=C(N=C(N1OCCCOC2=CC(=C(C=C2Cl)Cl)Cl)N)N)C.Cl 0" and "C1=CC(=CC=C1SC(P(=O)(O)[O-])P(=O)(O)[O-])Cl.[Na+].[Na+] 0". However, this rule cannot be applied universally because some compounds containing chlorine atoms have been reported to cause eye disorders as well.
Rule 3: The presence of fluorine atom or trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) on the aromatic ring of a compound may increase its potential to cause eye disorders as seen in SMILES string "C1CN(CCN1CCC=C2C3=CC=CC

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds between carbon atoms, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the first molecule in the dataset contains two carbonyl groups connected through a conjugated system of double bonds, which suggests that it may have the potential to cause eye disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule also applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the fourth molecule in the dataset contains a bromine atom, which suggests that it may have the potential to cause eye disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule only applies to one molecule in the dataset, which is represented by the seventh SMILES string labeled as "1". The presence of this functional group suggests that the molecule may have the potential to cause eye disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects. For example, molecules containing carbonyl groups such as aldehydes and ketones have been known to cause irritation or allergic reactions on contact with skin or eyes. Similarly, molecules containing sulfonyl groups have been associated with respiratory problems like asthma and bronchitis. Therefore, if a molecule contains these types of functional groups, it should be labeled as having potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule can also play a role in determining its ability to interact with biological systems. Molecules with larger sizes and complex shapes may have difficulty penetrating cell membranes and interacting with target receptors, while smaller molecules with simpler structures may be more likely to do so. Therefore, if a molecule has a large molecular weight or complex structure, it may be less likely to cause adverse effects compared to a smaller molecule with a simple structure.
Rule 3: The charge of a molecule can affect its interaction with other charged species in solution. For instance, positively charged ions may attract negatively charged proteins or lipids within cells, leading to disruption of normal cellular processes. Therefore, if a molecule carries a positive charge, it may be more likely to cause adverse effects than one without a charge.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to eye disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) and a carbonyl group (C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders. The first example in the dataset (SMILES string C1=CC(=C(C=C1Cl)O)OC2=C(C=C(C=C2)Cl)Cl 0) satisfies this rule as it contains both groups.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2) and a conjugated system of double bonds, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders. The second example in the dataset (SMILES string CC1CCN(CC1N(C)C2=NC=NC3=C2C=CN3)C(=O)CC#N 0) satisfies this rule as it contains both groups.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains two or more aromatic rings connected by a single bond, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders. The third example in the dataset (SMILES string CCC(=O)OCC(=O)C1(CCC2C1(CC(C3C2CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC34C)O)C)OC(=O)OCC 0) satisfies this rule as it contains two benzene rings connected by a single bond

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having the potential to cause eye disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a benzenesulfonyl group (-SO2Ph), it may also have the potential to cause eye disorders. The second molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has also been labeled as having the potential to cause eye disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains both a sulfonamide group and a benzenesulfonyl group, it may have even greater potential to cause eye disorders. This rule is based on the fact that these two groups are often found together in drugs known to cause eye disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains both of these functional groups and has been labeled as having the greatest potential to cause eye disorders among all the molecules in the dataset.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains two lithium atoms bonded together followed by a carbon atom double-bonded to oxygen and single-bonded to another oxygen atom, then it is likely to have side-effect activity related to eye disorders. The SMILES string for this molecule is [Li+].[Li+].C(=O)([O-])[O-] 1.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a conjugated system consisting of four alternating carbon-nitrogen bonds in a ring, then it may also have side-effect activity related to eye disorders. The SMILES string for this molecule is CCCC1=NN(C2=C1NC(=NC2=O)C3=C(C=CC(=C3)S(=O)(=O)N4CCN(CC4)C)OCC)C 1.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (a carbon-oxygen double bond) connected to a hydroxyl group (a hydrogen atom bonded to an oxygen atom) through a single bond, then it is less likely to have side-effect activity related to eye disorders. The SMILES strings for these molecules are CC(=O)[O-] 0 and C(C1C(C(C(C(O1)

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a chlorine atom (-Cl) attached to a benzene ring (represented by the SMILES string C6H5 in the dataset), then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by the first two SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom (-F) and a nitrogen atom (-N) bonded together in a five-membered ring (represented by the SMILES string NCF in the dataset), then it may also have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by the third SMILES string labeled as "1" in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an iodine atom (-I) bonded to each other, then it does not seem to have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by the fourth SMILES string labeled as "0" in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: If the compound contains the functional group "-CN" and "-CCNNC(=O)" in its structure, then it has a high probability of causing eye disorders as a side effect. The presence of these groups indicates that the compound may have a strong interaction with biological systems, which could lead to unwanted effects such as eye disorders.
Rule 2: If the compound contains the functional group "-COOH" or "-SO3H" attached to an aromatic ring, then it has a low probability of causing eye disorders as a side effect. These groups are known for their ability to dissolve in water, making them less likely to interact with other molecules in the body.
Rule 3: If the compound contains the functional group "-CCONHC(=O)" adjacent to an aromatic ring, then it has a moderate probability of causing eye disorders as a side effect. This group is similar to the one mentioned in Rule 1 but with a different arrangement of atoms. It is possible that this group also has a strong interaction with biological systems, although not as strong as the "-CN" and "-CCNNC(=O)" groups.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) and carboxyl group (COOH) in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing eye disorders. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 or 0. For example, in the first SMILES string, there is a carbonyl group present which could potentially contribute to the observed eye disorder activity. However, this rule alone cannot accurately predict if a particular molecule will cause eye disorders since other factors such as concentration, exposure time, and individual susceptibility also play a role.
Rule 2: The absence of certain structural features in a molecule may decrease its ability to cause eye disorders. For instance, the second SMILES string does not contain any functional groups commonly associated with eye disorders but still has no reported activity. Therefore, the lack of specific substructures may indicate a lower risk of adverse effects.
Rule 3: The position and orientation of functional groups within a molecule can also affect its potential to cause eye disorders. For example, the third SMILES string contains a fluorine atom attached to one of the carbon atoms in the ring structure. Fluorine is known for its electronegativity and may alter the electronic properties of the molecule, affecting its interaction with biological targets. Additionally, the fourth SMILES string shows that the orientation of the functional group can impact the activity of the molecule. Overall, these rules provide insights into how molecular structures can influence their activities and should be taken into consideration when predicting the potential toxicity of new compounds.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfhydryl group and carbonyl group in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on eyes.
Explanation: The first three molecules contain sulfur atoms which form sulfhydryl groups. These compounds have been reported to cause eye irritation or damage. Additionally, all three molecules also contain carbonyl groups which can react with proteins in the body leading to tissue damage. Therefore, these functional groups may be responsible for their observed side-effects.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings and nitro groups may have a higher likelihood of causing eye disorders.
Explanation: The fourth molecule contains two phenyl rings connected by a nitrogen atom. Phenyl rings are known to be toxic and can irritate the skin and eyes. Nitro groups are also known to be toxic and can cause inflammation and tissue damage. Therefore, this combination of structural features may contribute to the observed side-effects of this compound.
Rule 3: Compounds containing metal ions may have a greater tendency to cause eye disorders due to their ability to interact with biological systems.
Explanation: The fifth molecule contains gold atoms which are known to be highly reactive. This reactivity may lead to interactions with biomolecules within the body resulting in toxicity. Furthermore, the sixth molecule contains iron ions which can participate in redox reactions leading to oxidative stress and tissue damage. Therefore, the presence of metal ions in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on eyes.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a negatively charged ion such as Ca+2 or Mg+2, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies only to the first compound in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a functional group such as CC(C)OC(=O)C(C)(C)OC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)C2=CC=C(C=C2)Cl, which is commonly found in compounds that affect vision, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies only to the thirteenth compound in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, such as C1=CC(=C(C=C1I)O)OC2=C(C=C(C=C2)I)I, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies only to the sixteenth compound in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and carboxylic acid in a compound may increase its potential for causing eye disorders.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to adverse effects. For example, sulfonyl groups can bind to receptors on cell membranes and alter their signaling pathways, while carbonyl and carboxylic acid groups can form hydrogen bonds with amino acids in proteins and disrupt their structure and function.
Rule 2: A compound containing conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings may also increase its potential for causing eye disorders.
Explanation: Conjugated double bonds and aromatic rings can enhance the stability and reactivity of a compound, making it more likely to interact with biological molecules and cause adverse effects. Additionally, these structures can facilitate electron transfer reactions, which can lead to oxidative stress and tissue damage.
Rule 3: Compounds with molecular weights greater than 500 Daltons may be less likely to cross the blood-eye barrier and cause eye disorders.
Explanation: Larger compounds may have lower permeability through tissues due to their size and polarity, reducing their likelihood of interacting with ocular tissues and causing adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in the ring structure, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a chlorine atom attached to one of the carbon atoms in the ring structure.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a fluorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in the aromatic ring, then it may not have the potential to cause eye disorders. The second molecule in the dataset does not satisfy this rule since it only contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) instead of a nitro group or a fluorine atom.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen-containing functional group such as an amine (-NH2) or a nitrile (-CN), then it may not have the potential to cause eye disorders. The third molecule in the dataset does not satisfy this rule since it only contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) instead of a nitrogen-containing functional group.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1=CC(=CN=C1)C(=O)NCCO[N+](=O)[O-] 1, CC(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C 1, CCS(=O)(=O)O 1, CNS(=O)(=O)CC1=CC2=C(C=C1)NC=C2CCN(C)C 1, CCC1(C(=O)NCNC1=O)C2=CC=CC=C2 1, COC1=C2C(=CC3=C1OC=C3)C=CC(=O)O2 0, and CS(=O)(=O)O 1.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a conjugated system consisting of alternating single and double bonds, such as in the case of a phenyl ring, then it may also have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings I 1, CC1=C(N=C(N=C1N)C(CC(=O)N)NCC(C(=O)N)N)C(=O)NC(C(C2=CN=CN2)O[C@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](O3)CO)O)O

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, it may have potential side effects on eyes. The first two molecules in the given dataset contain both these functional groups and they are labeled as having side-effects on eyes.
Rule 2: If a compound has a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, it may also have potential side effects on eyes. The third molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and it is labeled as having side-effects on eyes.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a conjugated system of double bonds between an aromatic ring and an amide group (-CONH-), it may be less likely to have side-effects on eyes. The fourth molecule in the dataset does not contain any of the above mentioned structural features and it is labeled as not having side-effects on eyes.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in the para position relative to a carbonyl group, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to the first SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a thiocarbonyl group, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to the second SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 0.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a cyano group attached to a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to the third SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 1.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided by this small dataset and should be used cautiously until further research can confirm their validity.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the eyes.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to cause irritation or inflammation in the eyes when present in certain compounds. Therefore, if a compound contains these groups, it is more likely to cause eye disorders than one without them.
Rule 2: A compound containing a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group through a single bond has a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on the eyes compared to those without this structure.
Explanation: Benzene rings are known to be toxic and can irritate the skin and eyes. When they are connected to a carbonyl group via a single bond, they may enhance their toxicity and cause irritation to the eyes.
Rule 3: Compounds containing nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as pyrimidine and pyridine may also increase the risk of causing adverse effects on the eyes due to their inherent reactivity and potential to form covalent bonds with biological molecules.
Explanation: Nitrogen-containing heterocycles are commonly found in drugs and other chemicals used in industry. They can interact with proteins and enzymes in the body, leading to various health problems including eye disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as "CC(C[N+](C)(C)C)OC(=O)N" or "C1CN=C(N1)CC2=CC=CC3=CC=CC=C32", then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. These functional groups are commonly found in drugs that are known to cause eye irritation or inflammation.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a gadolinium ion (Gd+3), then it may also have the potential to cause eye disorders. Gadolinium is a rare earth metal that is often used in medical imaging tests like MRI. While there have been reports of gadolinium causing allergic reactions in some patients, more research is needed to determine if it can actually cause eye disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a functional group such as "CC(C)C[C@@H](C(=O)[C@]1(CO1)C)NC(=O)[C@H](CC2=CC=CC=C2)NC(=O)[C@H](CC(C)C)NC(=O)[C@H](CCC3=CC=CC=C3)NC(=O)CN4CCOCC4",

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with CC(C1=CC(=C(C=C1)C2=CC=CC=C2)F)C(=O)O or C(C1C(C(C(C(O1)O)F)O)O)O.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sodium ion and a nitrate ion, then it may not have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with [NH+](=O)[O-].[Na+].
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom in a five-membered ring, which is also bonded to another oxygen atom, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with CN1CCC23C4C1CC5=C2C(=C(C=C5)O)OC3C(=O)CC4 or CCCC1CC(N(C1)C)C(=O)NC(C2C(C(C(C(O2)SC)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)C(C)Cl.


================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of Gd+3 in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on eyes.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains fluorine atom and has a functional group like -COOH or -OH attached to it, then it may have potential adverse effects on eyes.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have potential adverse effects on eyes.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the eyes. This rule can be applied to the second SMILES string where there is a sulfonamide group present which could potentially lead to eye irritation or inflammation if the compound enters the body.
Rule 2: The presence of aromatic rings in a compound may also increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the eyes due to their ability to absorb UV light and generate free radicals. This rule can be applied to the third SMILES string where there is an aromatic ring present which could potentially lead to damage to the cornea if exposed to sunlight.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a compound's structure may also play a role in determining its potential for causing adverse effects on the eyes. Compounds with longer chains or more complex structures may have greater difficulty penetrating the eye and reaching the target tissue, leading to reduced toxicity. This rule can be applied to the fifth SMILES string where the compound has a relatively simple structure compared to other compounds in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like "Cl" or "NO2" in the structure of a molecule, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects on eyes.
Explanation: The presence of these groups increases the reactivity of the molecule and may lead to interactions with other molecules within the body which could result in adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecular formula contains elements such as sulfur, phosphorus, nitrogen etc., then it has a higher chance of causing adverse effects on eyes.
Explanation: These elements have a tendency to form covalent bonds with other atoms resulting in the formation of complex structures which may interact with biological systems leading to adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains aromatic rings, then it also has a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on eyes.
Explanation: Aromatic rings are planar and have a delocalized electron system which makes them more reactive than non-aromatic compounds. This increased reactivity may lead to interactions with other molecules within the body resulting in adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects on eyes. For example, the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and a double bond (=C=) in the given SMILES strings suggests their possible involvement in eye disorders. However, this rule alone cannot accurately predict if a particular molecule will cause such effects as other factors like concentration, exposure time, and individual susceptibility also play a role.
Rule 2: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure may also affect its ability to penetrate the eye tissues and cause damage. Longer chains or more complex structures may hinder penetration while simpler ones may be easier to absorb. Therefore, molecules with shorter chain lengths and fewer rings may have a higher likelihood of causing eye disorders. This rule should be used in conjunction with Rule 1 to make predictions about a molecule's toxicity.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule may also influence its biological activity. For instance, the configuration of chiral centers in a molecule may determine how easily it binds to target receptors and causes adverse effects. Therefore, molecules with specific configurations at chiral centers may have a greater chance of causing eye disorders than those without them. This rule should be considered when predicting the toxicity of a molecule but requires further research to fully understand its implications.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of a functional group such as "C=O" or "C#N" in the molecular structure, then it may lead to potential toxicity and adverse effects on the human body. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 for their corresponding SMILES strings. For example, in the first SMILES string, the presence of "C(=O)N1CC2=CC=CC=C2C[C@H]1C(=O)O" indicates the possibility of causing eye disorders due to its structural similarity to known toxic compounds.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a metal ion such as platinum, it may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects. This rule also applies to molecules labeled as 1 for their corresponding SMILES strings. For instance, in the third SMILES string, the presence of "[Pt+2]" suggests that the compound could have potential therapeutic applications but may also pose risks if used improperly.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure has a high degree of symmetry and complexity, it may indicate low stability and potentially higher reactivity. This rule applies to all molecules regardless of their labels since they all contain some level of chemical complexity. However, this rule does not provide any specific information about how these structures may affect biological systems.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains two or more negatively charged oxygen atoms in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the first molecule listed in the dataset, Li2L3, where L represents a negatively charged oxygen atom, satisfies this condition and is labeled as "1" because it causes eye disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds between carbon atoms, then it may not have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" in the dataset. For example, the fourth molecule listed in the dataset, CC1=C(C(=O)C2=CC=CC=C2C1=O)CC=C(C)CCCC(C)CCCC(C)CCCC(C)C, does not contain any negatively charged oxygen atoms but does contain a conjugated system of double bonds between carbon atoms and is therefore labeled as "0" because it does not cause eye disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as either "0" or "1" in the dataset. For example, the twelfth molecule listed in the dataset, CN1CCC23C4C1CC5=C2C(=C(C=C5)OC)OC3C(C=C4)O, contains a nitro group and is labeled as "1" because it causes eye disorders. However, note that this rule is not a guarantee that a molecule containing a nitro group will cause eye disorders, as other factors such as dosage and individual susceptibility also play a role.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to eye disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure "COCCOC(=O)NCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)NCCCCCOP(=O)(C)O)NC(=O)OCCOC" or any of its variations, then it is likely to have side-effect activity related to eye disorders and should be labeled as 1. This rule takes into account the presence of certain functional groups and their arrangement within the molecule, which may contribute to its biological activity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure "CCC1(C2=C(COC1=O)C(=O)N3CC4=C(C3=C2)N=C5C=CC(=C(C5=C4)CN(C)C)O)O" or any of its variations, then it is unlikely to have side-effect activity related to eye disorders and should be labeled as 0. This rule considers the absence of specific structural features that may be associated with toxicity or other undesirable activities.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains the substructure "C[C@@H]1CCO[C@@H]2N1C(=O)C3=C(C(=O)C(=CN3C2)C(=O)NCC4=C(C=C(C=C4)F)F)[O-].[Na+]" or any of its variations, then it is also unlikely to have side-effect activity related to eye disorders and should be labeled as 0. This rule takes into account the presence of sodium ions, which may indicate that the molecule is highly polar and may interact unfavorably with biological systems.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a functional group such as aldehyde or ketone in its structure and has a benzene ring attached to it, then it may have potential side effects on eyes. The presence of these groups increases the chances of irritation and inflammation in the eyes. For example, in the first SMILES string, the compound has both aldehyde and ketone groups along with two fluorine atoms which increase the hydrophobicity of the compound making it more likely to irritate the eyes. Therefore, this compound should be labeled as having potential side effects on eyes.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a nitro group in its structure, then it may also have potential side effects on eyes. This group can cause irritation and inflammation in the eyes due to its strong oxidizing property. For instance, in the fifth SMILES string, the compound has a nitro group which makes it highly reactive and potentially harmful to the eyes. Hence, this compound should also be labeled as having potential side effects on eyes.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group in its structure, then it may have potential side effects on eyes. This group can cause irritation and redness in the eyes due to its acidic nature. For example, in the seventh SMILES string, the compound has a sulfonyl group which makes it acidic and can cause irritation in the eyes. Thus, this compound should also be labeled as having potential side effects on eyes.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of the functional group "-CN" in the molecular structure, then it may lead to causing eye disorder as indicated by the labeled SMILES string 'CCNC(=NCCCC[C@H](C(=O)N[C@@H](CC(C)C)C(=O)N[C@@H](CCCCN=C(NCC)NCC)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N[C@H](C)C(=O)N)NC(=O)[C@H](CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)NC(=O)[C@H](CO)NC(=O)[C@@H](CC3=CN=CC=C3)NC(=O)[C@@H](CC4=CC=C(C=C4)Cl)NC(=O)[C@@H](CC5=CC6=CC=CC=C6C=C5)NC(=O)C)NCC'. This rule suggests that molecules containing the cyano group have the potential to cause eye disorders due to their ability to bind to receptors and disrupt normal cellular processes.
Rule 2: If there is a presence of the functional group '-NO2' or '-COOH' in the molecular structure, then it may not be associated with causing eye disorders as indicated by the unlabeled SMILES strings 'NN(Cc1ccccc1Oc1ccc(cc1Br)Br)S(=O)(=O)Nc1ccccc1Oc1ccc(cc1Br)Br' and 'CCCS(=O)(=O)n1nc(C(=O)NS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(cc2)C(F)(F)F)sc1C(F)(F)F' respectively. These two examples suggest that molecules containing these groups do not necessarily cause eye disorders but rather depend on other factors such as concentration, exposure time, and individual susceptibility.
Rule 3: If there is a presence of the functional group '-NH2' in the molecular structure, then it may also not be associated with causing eye disorders as indicated by the unlabeled SMILES string 'CClC(=O)N(C)C(=O)C1(C)C(=O)N(C)C(=O)C(C)(C)C1(C)C'. Similar to Rule 2, this example suggests that molecules containing this group do not necessarily cause eye disorders but rather depend on other factors.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) and a carbonyl group (C=O), then it may have potential side effects on eyes. The given SMILES strings containing SO2R and C=O groups should be labeled as 1 for their possible association with eye disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure has a nitro group (NO2) attached to an aromatic ring or an aliphatic chain, then it may also have potential side effects on eyes. The second SMILES string in the dataset contains NO2 group and should be labeled as 1.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure includes a guanidine group (-C(NR)(NR')C-), then it may have potential side effects on eyes. The fifth SMILES string in the dataset contains this functional group and should be labeled as 1.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like "-COOH" or "-OH" in the structure of a molecule, then it has high probability of causing adverse effects on eyes. The given SMILES strings with labels 1 have such groups present which indicate their potential for causing eye disorders.
Rule 2: If a compound contains aromatic rings and multiple double bonds conjugated together, it may also lead to eye disorders due to its ability to absorb light energy and generate heat. This property is known as chromophore. The given SMILES string C1=CC(=C(C=C1C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N)O)O.C1=CC(=C(C(=C1CNNC(=O)C(CO)N)O)O)O 1 has both these features and hence has higher chance of causing eye disorder.
Rule 3: Presence of nitro group (-NO2) in a chemical compound increases its reactivity and toxicity. Therefore, compounds containing this group should be avoided if possible. The given SMILES string CC12CCN(C1N(C3=C2C=C(C=C3)OC(=O)NC)C)C 0 has a nitro group present and therefore has lower safety profile compared to other molecules without this group.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a conjugated system of double bonds and has a negative charge on one oxygen atom, then it may have side effects related to eye disorders. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it has a conjugated system of double bonds between carbon atoms C1, C2, C3, and C4, and two sodium ions bonded to each other at opposite ends of the molecule. This creates a dipole moment which could interact with charged molecules or tissues in the body causing potential side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to a nitrogen atom, then it may not have any side effects related to eye disorders. The third molecule in the dataset violates this rule as it has a cyanamide group (-NH-CN) attached to a nitrogen atom instead of a simple cyano group. Cyanamides are known for their toxic properties and may cause adverse reactions if ingested or inhaled.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have side effects related to eye disorders. The fifth molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it has a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O). Chlorine atoms are often present in pharmaceuticals and can affect their biological activity by altering their chemical properties. However, further research would be needed to determine how exactly they contribute to side effects related to eye disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, AA, AB, AC, AD, AE, AF, AG, AH, AI, AJ, AK, AL, AM, AN, AO, AP, AQ, AR, AS, AT, AU, AV, AW, AX, AY, AZ, BA, BB, BC, BD, BE, BF, BG, BH, BI, BJ, BK, BL, BM, BN, BO, BP, BQ, BR, BS, BT, BU, BV, BW, BX, BY, BZ, CA, CB, CC, CD, CE, CF, CG, CH, CI, CJ, CK, CL, CM, CN, CO, CP, CQ, CR, CS, CT, CU, CV, CW, CX, CY, CZ, DA, DB, DC, DD, DE, DF, DG, DH, DI, DJ, DK, DL, DM, DN, DO, DP, DQ, DR, DS, DT, DU, DV, DW, DX, DY, DZ

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a metal ion such as iron or silver, it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. The first molecule in the dataset containing iron ions satisfies this rule. However, since there is only one example in the dataset, further research would be needed to confirm the validity of this rule.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may not have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule is supported by the second molecule in the dataset which does not contain any iron ions but still has a label of 0. It is possible that other factors such as the size and shape of the molecule also play a role in causing eye disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule is supported by the sixth molecule in the dataset which contains both a nitro group and a label of 1. Further research would be needed to determine how common this pattern is among molecules that cause eye disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) in the structure of a molecule may indicate its potential to cause eye disorders as seen in SMILES strings labeled as 1 for molecules CN1CCN2C(C1)C3=CC=CC=C3CC4=C2N=CC=C4 and COC1=CC2=C(C=CN=C2C=C1OC)OC3=CC=C(C=C3)NC(=O)C4(CC4)C(=O)NC5=CC=C(C=C5)F. However, this rule alone cannot be used to accurately predict the side effects of a molecule since other factors such as dosage, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility also play a role.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an aromatic ring or another electron-withdrawing group like -CF, -NF, etc. may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects due to increased reactivity and toxicity. This is evident from the fact that all molecules labeled as 1 contain at least one carbonyl group along with other functional groups like -NH, -OH, -SH, etc. which increase their overall polarity and reactivity. For example, in SMILES string CCC[C@]1(CC(=O)C(=C(O1)[O-])[C@H](CC)C2=CC(=CC=C2)[N-]S(=O)(=O)C3=NC=C(C=C3)C(F)(F)F)CCC4=CC=CC=C4.[Na+].[Na+], the presence of two sodium ions indicates high ionic character and suggests possible interaction with biological systems leading to toxic effects.
Rule 3: Molecules having a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring or an aliphatic chain tend to exhibit strong oxidizing properties and may cause adverse health effects including skin irritation

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the eyes.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to toxic effects. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles.
Rule 2: Compounds with aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also exhibit toxicity towards the eyes due to their ability to absorb UV radiation and generate reactive oxygen species.
Explanation: Exposure to sunlight or artificial light sources can trigger phototoxicity reactions in the eyes, which can lead to inflammation and tissue damage. Aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds are known to enhance the absorption of UV radiation by compounds, making them more susceptible to phototoxic effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with high molecular weight and complex structures may have limited bioavailability and penetration into ocular tissues, resulting in reduced efficacy and increased risk of adverse effects.
Explanation: Large and complex molecules may require longer periods of time to reach therapeutic concentrations within the target organs, increasing the likelihood of off-target interactions and adverse events. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the selection of appropriate drug delivery systems and formulation strategies to optimize the pharmacokinetic profile of these molecules.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to eye disorders:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders. The first example in the dataset meets this criterion, as it contains both a nitro group and a sulfonyl group.
Rule 2: If a compound contains two or more nitrogen atoms bonded together in a ring structure, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders. This rule applies to the second example in the dataset, which contains a pyrimidine ring.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a guanidine group (-C(NH2)=NR), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders. This rule applies to the third example in the dataset, which contains a guanidine group.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the eyes.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to toxicity or adverse reactions. For example, the sulfonyl group present in the first SMILES string may react with proteins in the eye tissue, causing irritation or inflammation.
Rule 2: A compound containing conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings may also be associated with increased risk of ocular toxicity due to its ability to absorb light energy and generate reactive oxygen species.
Explanation: Conjugated double bonds and aromatic rings can act as electron acceptors or donors, allowing them to interact with other molecules and form stable radicals. This property can lead to oxidative stress and damage to cellular components, including DNA, lipids, and proteins.
Rule 3: Compounds with high molecular weight and complex structures may have limited solubility and bioavailability, making them less likely to penetrate into the eye tissues and cause adverse effects.
Explanation: High molecular weight compounds tend to have lower water solubility, which can limit their absorption through the cornea and conjunctiva. Additionally, complex structures may require more time and energy to break down and metabolize, reducing their rate of clearance from the body. Therefore, these types of compounds may need higher doses or longer exposure times to elicit toxic effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having the potential to cause eye disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), then it may also have the potential to cause eye disorders. The second molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has also been labeled as having the potential to cause eye disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, then it may also have the potential to cause eye disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains a benzene ring and has been labeled as potentially causing eye disorders.
