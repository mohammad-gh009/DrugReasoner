Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfhydryl group (SH) or a disulfide bond (SS), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to their ability to bind to proteins and disrupt their function. The presence of these groups can also make the molecule more reactive and prone to oxidation. Therefore, molecules containing SH or SS should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects by reacting with other molecules and forming toxic compounds. Nitro groups can also increase the molecule's reactivity and hydrophobicity, which can affect its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties. Therefore, molecules containing NO2 should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its ability to interact with biological receptors and disrupt normal cellular processes. Benzene rings can also increase the molecule's lipophilicity, which can affect its ADME properties and lead to accumulation in tissues. Therefore, molecules containing benzene rings should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a carbonyl group (COR), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and are labeled as having side-effect activity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a phosphorus atom bonded to four carbon atoms, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains this structural feature and is labeled as having no side-effect activity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a gold atom, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The fourth molecule in the dataset contains a gold atom and is labeled as having no side-effect activity.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system. For example, the molecules containing sulfonamide or nitro groups have been known to cause allergic reactions and other immune system disorders. Therefore, if a molecule contains such functional groups, it should be labeled as having a high likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system.
Rule 2: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a molecule also play important roles in determining its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological systems. Generally, larger and more hydrophobic molecules tend to have higher toxicity than smaller and less hydrophobic ones. Therefore, if a molecule has a relatively large size and high hydrophobicity, it should be labeled as having a moderate likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system.
Rule 3: The presence of specific structural features in a molecule may also affect its ability to bind to receptors and enzymes involved in various physiological processes. For instance, some studies have shown that the presence of aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds in a molecule can increase its affinity towards certain receptors and enzymes. Therefore, if a molecule contains these types of structures, it should be labeled as having a low likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the first molecule listed in the dataset contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom and is labeled as "1" because it is known to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" in the dataset. For example, the second molecule listed in the dataset contains a sulfonamide group but is labeled as "0" because it is not known to cause any adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. This rule also applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the third molecule listed in the dataset contains a nitro group and is labeled as "1" because it is known to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system. This rule applies to compounds #2 and #4 which have a nitro group attached to their structures.
Rule 2: Compounds containing a sulfonamide functional group (-SO2NH2) may also increase the risk of adverse effects on the immune system. This rule applies to compound #1 whose structure contains a sulfonamide group.
Rule 3: The absence of certain functional groups or atoms in a compound may decrease its potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system. For example, compounds #3 and #5 do not contain any nitro or sulfonamide groups but still do not exhibit any adverse effects. Therefore, these two compounds may be considered safe for use.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to immune system disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The first example in the dataset, C(C(CS)S)O, contains both groups and has been labeled as having such potential.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a fluoro substituent (-F) at position 2 of a benzene ring, which is attached to a pyrazole ring through a nitrogen atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The second example in the dataset, CC1CN(CCN1)C2=C(C=C3C(=C2OC)N(C=C(C3=O)C(=O)O)C4CC4)F, satisfies this condition and has also been labeled as having such potential.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a guanidine group (-C(NH2)2) or a urea group (-CONH-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The third example in the dataset, C[N+](C)(C)CCO, contains a guanidine group and has been labeled as having such potential.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to immune system disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains the substructure "CCS(=O)(=O)O" or "CC(=O)NN", then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains the substructure "CCCC1OC2CC3C4CCC5=CC(=O)C=CC5(C4C(CC3(C2(O1)C(=O)CO)C)O)C" or "CC(C)(C(=O)O)OC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)C2=CC=C(C=C2)Cl", then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 0 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains the substructure "COC1=CC2=C(C=CN=C2C=C1OC)OC3=CC=C(C=C3)NC(=O)C4(CC4)C(=O)NC5=CC=C(C=C5)F" or "C1CCC(CC1)C(CC2CCCCN2)C3CCCCC3", then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. However, this rule should be used cautiously and further testing would be needed to confirm its accuracy. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the dataset.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to immune system disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have side-effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 9 and 10 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a double bond, then it may have side-effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 11 and 12 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrile group (-CN) followed by a benzene ring, then it may have side-effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecule number 13 in the dataset.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1C(O1)CCl.C(CNCCNCCNCCN)N CC1CN(CCN1)C2=C(C=C3C(=C2OC)N(C=C(C3=O)C(=O)O)C4CC4)F 1
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2) or a carbonyl group (CO), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CS(=O)C COCCCC(=O)O CCC(=O)OC1CCC2C1(CCC3C2CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C CCS(=O)C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)C2=C(C(=CC=C2)CC(=O)N)N CN1C2=C(C=C(C=C2)Cl)C(=NC(C1=O)O)C3=CC=CC=C

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as nitro groups or aromatic rings in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, which could lead to negative consequences.
Rule 2: Molecules containing sulfur atoms may be more likely to cause adverse effects than those without them.
Explanation: Sulfur atoms have a high electron density and can form strong covalent bonds with other atoms, making them potentially reactive and toxic.
Rule 3: A molecule's size and shape may also play a role in determining its potential to cause adverse effects. For example, larger molecules may have greater steric hindrance and be less able to fit into target sites within the body.
Explanation: This rule is based on observations that some drugs with similar chemical structures can have different levels of toxicity depending on their size and shape.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system. This rule applies to compounds #2 and #4 which have a nitro group attached to their structures.
Rule 2: Compounds containing a sulfonamide functional group (-SO2NH2) may also increase the risk of adverse effects on the immune system. This rule applies to compound #1 whose structure contains a sulfonamide group.
Rule 3: The absence of certain functional groups or atoms in a compound may decrease its potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system. For example, compounds #3 and #5 do not contain any nitro or sulfonamide groups but still do not exhibit any adverse effects. Therefore, these two compounds may be considered safe for use.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system. For example, the presence of carbonyl group (C=O) and double bond (C=C) in the given SMILES strings suggests that they could be potential candidates for causing such effects. However, this rule alone cannot accurately predict if a particular molecule will have any adverse effects or not as other factors like dosage, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility also play a role.
Rule 2: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound can affect its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets. Therefore, molecules with higher molecular weights and hydrophobicities may have a greater chance of causing adverse effects due to their increased ability to penetrate cells and bind to proteins. This rule can help narrow down the list of potential candidate molecules but still requires further testing to confirm their safety.
Rule 3: The presence of specific chemical elements in a molecule can also influence its toxicity. For instance, lanthanum (La) is known to have toxic effects on the nervous system while silver (Ag) has antimicrobial properties but can also be toxic at high concentrations. Therefore, analyzing the elemental composition of a molecule can provide additional insights into its potential toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system. For example, the carbonyl group (C=O) present in the first SMILES string could be responsible for the observed side-effects. Similarly, the carboxylic acid group (COOH) and the amide group (CONH) present in the second and third SMILES strings respectively, could also contribute to their toxicity.
Rule 2: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a molecule may also play a role in determining its potential to cause adverse effects. Molecules with higher molecular weights and greater hydrophobicities tend to have longer half-lives and are more likely to accumulate in tissues, leading to toxic effects. This could explain why the fourth SMILES string contains a long carbon chain and the fifth SMILES string has two benzene rings.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule can also affect its biological activity. The sixth SMILES string shows that the configuration of the double bond between C1 and C2 affects the orientation of the rest of the molecule, which could impact its ability to interact with target molecules or enzymes. Additionally, the seventh SMILES string demonstrates how the position of substituents on a ring can influence its bioactivity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to the immune system disorder. This rule applies to molecules 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 8

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and has a molecular weight less than or equal to 500 Daltons, then it may have potential side effects on the immune system. The first two molecules in the table contain this functional group and have labels indicating their possible relation to immune system disorders. However, this rule should be used as a general guideline and not as a definitive predictor of side effects.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a nitro group (NO2), then it may have potential side effects on the immune system. The third molecule in the table contains this functional group but does not have any information about its relationship to immune system disorders. Therefore, further research would be needed to determine if this compound could cause such side effects.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) attached to a carbon atom, then it may have potential side effects on the immune system. The sixth molecule in the table contains a chlorine atom and has a label indicating its possible relation to immune system disorders. Again, this rule should be used as a general guideline and not as a definitive predictor of side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to immune system disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a benzene ring (-C6H5), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The first example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains both these functional groups.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a pyridine ring (-C5H5N), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The second example in the dataset satisfies this rule as well.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a ferrocene group (-Fe(C5H5)2) or a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to a carbon atom that is part of a conjugated system containing multiple double bonds, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The third example in the dataset violates this rule since it does not contain any such functional groups.

================================

Rule 3: If the molecule contains two amide groups (-CONH-) connected by a single bond, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The sixth molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains such a structure.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) and amide group (-CONH-) in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system. These functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions.
Rule 2: A molecule containing halogen atoms such as fluorine or chlorine may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects due to their electronegativity and ability to form hydrogen bonds with other molecules. This can affect the binding affinity between ligands and receptors, leading to altered signaling pathways and cellular responses.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure may also play a role in determining its toxicity. Longer chains of carbon atoms and more complex branching patterns can make it harder for the body to break down and eliminate the molecule, increasing the likelihood of accumulation and adverse effects. Additionally, the presence of multiple rings or aromatic structures can enhance the stability of the molecule and increase its resistance to degradation.

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2) or a carbonyl group (CO), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects.

Rule 3: If the molecule contains two amide groups (-CONH-) connected by a single bond, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. The sixth molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains such a structure.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) and amide group (-CONH-) in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system. These functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions.
Rule 2: A molecule containing halogen atoms such as fluorine or chlorine may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects due to their electronegativity and ability to form hydrogen bonds with other molecules. This can affect the binding affinity between ligands and receptors, leading to altered signaling pathways and cellular responses.

Longer chains of carbon atoms and more complex branching patterns can make it harder for the body to break down and eliminate the molecule, increasing the likelihood of accumulation and adverse effects. Additionally, the presence of multiple rings or aromatic structures can enhance the stability of the molecule and increase its resistance to degradation.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three possible rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to the immune system disorder. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "CC12CC(C3C(C1CCC2(C(=O)CO)O)CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC34C)O 1", "C1=CC(=C(C(=C1)Cl)SC(CCC2=CC=C(C=C2)Cl)CN3C=CN=C3)Cl.[N+](=O)(O)[O-] 0", "COC1=CC(=CC(=C1OC)OC)C2C3C(COC3=O)C(C4=CC5=C(C=C24)OCO5)O 1", "C1C(C(OC1N2C=C(C(=O)NC2=O)F)CO)O 1", "CC(C)NCC(COC1=CC=CC2=CC=CC=C21)O 1"

================================

Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects on the immune system. The presence of these functional groups may increase the reactivity of the molecule and lead to toxic reactions in the body.
Example: Molecule 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 have both a nitro group and a halogen atom, so they are likely to be associated with adverse effects on the immune system.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it also has a high probability of causing adverse effects on the immune system. Sulfonamides are known to have antimicrobial properties, but they can also cause allergic reactions in some individuals.
Example: Molecule 16 has a sulfonamide group, so it is likely to be associated with adverse effects on the immune system.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, then it may also contribute to its ability to cause adverse effects on the immune system. Benzene is a known carcinogen and can disrupt normal cell growth and division.
Example: Molecule 17 has a benzene ring, so it is likely to be associated with adverse effects on the immune system.

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 14.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a pyridine ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to immune system disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 21 and 22.
Note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the given dataset and should be treated as preliminary until further validated by experimental studies.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the immune system. This rule applies to compounds #2 and #4 which have a nitro group attached to their structures.
Rule 2: Compounds containing a sulfonamide functional group (-SO2NH2) may also increase the risk of adverse effects on the immune system. This rule applies to compound #1 whose structure contains a sulfonamide group.
Rule 3: The absence of certain functional groups or atoms in a compound may decrease its potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system. For example, compounds #3 and #5 do not contain any nitro or sulfonamide groups but still do not exhibit any adverse effects. Therefore, these two compounds may be considered safe for use.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as nitro groups or halogen atoms in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the immune system.
Explanation: These functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to negative consequences. For example, the nitro group present in the first SMILES string can act as an electron-withdrawing group, making the molecule more reactive and potentially toxic. Similarly, the chlorine atom in the seventh SMILES string can alter the electronic structure of the molecule and affect its binding affinity towards target proteins.
Rule 2: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure may also play a role in determining its toxicity. Compounds with longer chains or multiple rings may have greater flexibility and be able to bind to multiple targets, increasing their likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Example: The third SMILES string has a complex structure with multiple rings and double bonds, which may make it more likely to interact with biological molecules and cause harm.
Rule 3: The presence of certain chemical moieties, such as sulfonates or phosphates, may indicate that a compound could cause adverse effects on the immune system.
Example: The thirteenth SMILES string contains a sulfonate group, which can interfere with cellular processes and lead to inflammation or other harmful effects.
