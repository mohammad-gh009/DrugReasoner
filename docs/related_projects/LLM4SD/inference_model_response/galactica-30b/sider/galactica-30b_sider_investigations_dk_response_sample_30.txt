Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The first example in the dataset contains both groups and is labeled as having the potential for adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. The third example in the dataset contains two chlorines and is labeled as having the potential for adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrile group (-CN), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects. The last example in the dataset contains a nitrile group but is still labeled as having no potential for adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as "CCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)NCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)NC(=O)[C@@H]1CCCN1C(=O)[C@H]([C@@H](C)O)NC(=O)[C@H](CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)NC(=O)[C@H](CC3=CC=CC=C3)NC(=O)[C@H](CC4=CC=CC=C4)NC(=O)CNC(=O)[C@H](CCCNC(=N)N)NC(=O)[C@H](CCC(=O)O)NC(=O)CNC(=O)[C@@H]5CSSC[C@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H]6

================================



================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a gadolinium ion ([Gd+3]) in its structure, then it is likely to have side effects. This rule is based on the fact that gadolinium ions are known to be toxic and can cause adverse reactions in some individuals. Therefore, molecules containing this element should be carefully evaluated for their safety before being used in any investigation.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl) attached to a nitrogen atom (N) in its structure, and also contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have side effects. This rule is based on the fact that nitro compounds are known to be toxic and can cause adverse reactions in some individuals. Therefore, molecules containing these elements should be carefully evaluated for their safety before being used in any investigation.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) adjacent to a double bond (=C) in its structure, then it may have side effects. This rule is based on the fact that such structures can be reactive and can interact with other molecules in the body, potentially causing adverse reactions. Therefore, molecules containing these elements should be carefully evaluated for their safety before being used in any investigation.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of nitro group (-NO2) in the structure may increase the probability of causing adverse effects. This is because nitro groups are known to be toxic and can cause damage to cells. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should be carefully investigated for their potential side-effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or bromine may also have a higher chance of causing adverse effects due to their ability to react with other molecules in the body. However, further research is needed to determine if there is a direct correlation between the number and type of halogen atoms present in a molecule and its toxicity.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of the carbon chain in a molecule may also play a role in determining its toxicity. Longer chains may make the molecule more difficult to metabolize and eliminate from the body, leading to accumulation and increased risk of adverse effects. Additionally, molecules with multiple rings or complex structures may also pose a greater risk of toxicity due to their ability to interact with biological systems in unique ways.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as cyanide or azide, it may have toxic effects on living organisms. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be labeled as having potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds may also have toxic effects due to their ability to interact with biological systems. Therefore, molecules containing these structural features should also be labeled as potentially harmful.
Rule 3: The presence of certain atoms in the molecular structure, such as iron or sodium, may indicate potential toxicity if they are present at high concentrations. However, this rule is less specific than Rules 1 and 2 because the concentration required for toxicity may vary depending on other factors such as the type of organism being exposed.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three possible rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects or not based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains two gold atoms, then it is likely to have side effects. This rule is based on the fact that some drugs containing gold have been associated with side effects such as skin rashes and liver damage. However, this rule should be taken with caution since there may be other factors involved in causing these side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfhydryl group (represented by the SMILES notation "SH2+") and a carbonyl group (represented by the SMILES notation "C=O"), then it is unlikely to have side effects. This rule is based on the fact that many molecules containing both groups are essential for biological processes and do not have any known side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom, then it is likely to have side effects. This rule is based on the fact that several drugs containing chlorine atoms have been associated with various side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any occurrence of the SMILES string CC[C@H](C)[C@@H](C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(=O)O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(=O)O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC(C)C)C(=O)O)NC(=O)[C@H](CCC(=O)O)NC(=O)[C@H](CCC(=O)O)NC(=O)[C@H](CC3=CC=CC=C3)NC(=O)[C@H](CC(=O)O)NC(=O)CNC(=O)[C@H](CC(=O)N)NC(=O)CNC(=O)CNC(=O)CNC(=O)CNC(=O)CNC(=O)[C@@H]4CCCN4C(=O)[C@H](CCCNC(=N)N)NC(=O)[C@@H]5CCCN5C(=O)[C@@H](CC6=CC=CC=C6)N in the molecular structure, then it may have potential side effects and should be investigated further.
Explanation: The SMILES string CC[C@H](C)[C@@H](C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the sulfonamide group present in the second SMILES string may be associated with allergic reactions or other adverse effects. Therefore, if a molecule contains such groups, it should be carefully evaluated for potential risks.
Rule 2: The length and complexity of a molecule may also affect its ability to cause adverse effects. Generally, longer and more complex molecules tend to have lower bioavailability and higher toxicity. Therefore, simpler molecules may be less likely to cause adverse effects than more complex ones.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule may play a role in determining its biological activity and potential adverse effects. For example, the configuration of chiral centers in a molecule may affect its binding affinity to target proteins or enzymes. Therefore, it is important to consider both the structure and stereochemistry of a molecule when evaluating its potential safety profile.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have potential side effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "CC1(C(=O)N(C(=O)O1)C)C", "CCCCCC(C=CC1C(CC(=O)C1CCCCCCC(=O)O)O)O", "CC1COC2=C3N1C=C(C(=O)C3=CC(=C2N4CCN(CC4)C)F)C(=O)O", and "[H-].[H-].[Sr+2]". These molecules all contain a sulfonamide group and have been labeled as having potential side effects in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have potential side effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "CC1COC2=C3N1C=C(C(=O)C3=CC(=C2N4CCN(CC4)C)F)C(=O)O" and "[H-].[H-]

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecular structure, then it may lead to potential adverse effects. The presence of this functional group may increase the reactivity and toxicity of the compound. Therefore, molecules containing such groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring, especially if it is substituted with electron-withdrawing groups like -NO2 or -COOH, then it may also contribute to potential adverse effects. These substituents can increase the reactivity of the aromatic ring, leading to increased toxicity.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may have potential adverse effects due to its ability to inhibit certain enzymes involved in various metabolic processes. This inhibition can lead to serious health problems including skin rashes, liver damage, and kidney failure.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a nitro group (-NO2) in the structure of a molecule, then it may cause adverse effects. The presence of this functional group increases the reactivity of the molecule and can lead to toxic reactions or side effects. For example, in the first SMILES string, the molecule contains a nitro group and has been labeled as having potential side-effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it may also have potential side-effects. This functional group is known for its antimicrobial properties but can also cause allergic reactions or other health problems. For instance, in the fourth SMILES string, the molecule contains a sulfonamide group and has been labeled as potentially causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (-Cl) or fluorine (-F), it may be associated with toxicity issues. These atoms can disrupt normal cell functions and lead to negative health outcomes. For example, in the eighth SMILES string, the molecule contains two chlorines and has been labeled as potentially harmful.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in a molecule has been linked to toxicity and adverse reactions. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for potential risks before being used in clinical settings.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule can also affect its ability to interact with biological systems and potentially cause adverse effects. Molecules that are too large or have a non-optimal shape may not be able to penetrate cell membranes or bind effectively to target receptors, leading to reduced efficacy or off-target interactions. Therefore, molecules with inappropriate sizes or shapes should be avoided or used cautiously.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule can also play a role in determining its biological activity and potential adverse effects. For example, some drugs exist as enantiomers (mirror image isomers) that can have different pharmacological activities and toxicities. Therefore, it is important to consider the stereochemical configuration of a molecule when evaluating its safety and efficacy.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as "CCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)NCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)NC(=O)[C@@H]1CCCN1C(=O)[C@H]([C@@H](C)O)NC(=O)[C@H](CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)NC(=O)[C@H](CC3=CC=CC=C3)NC(=O)[C@H](CC4=CC=CC=C4)NC(=O)CNC(=O)[C@H](CCCNC(=N)N)NC(=O)[C@H](CCC(=O)O)NC(=O)CNC(=O)[C@@H]5CSSC[C@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H]6

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the nitro group (-NO2) and the carbonyl group (-C=O) are known to be toxic and can cause adverse reactions in the body. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxicity.
Rule 2: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a molecule can also affect its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets. Molecules with high molecular weights or hydrophobicities may have difficulty crossing cell membranes and reaching their target sites, which could reduce their efficacy and increase their risk of adverse effects.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule can play a significant role in determining its bioactivity and toxicity. For instance, some enantiomers may exhibit different pharmacological activities or toxicities due to differences in their three-dimensional structures. Therefore, it is important to consider the stereochemical configuration of a molecule when evaluating its potential risks and benefits.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it may have side effects. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains two cyano groups.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carboxylate ion (-COO-), then it may not have side effects. The second molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a carboxylate ion.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a guanidine group (-C(=NH)NH2), then it may have side effects. The third molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a guanidine group.
Note that these rules are just examples and should not be considered definitive. It's important to conduct further research and testing before making any conclusions about the safety of specific molecules.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as carbonyl or carboxyl groups, it may lead to potential toxicity. The presence of these groups increases the reactivity of the compound and makes it more susceptible to metabolism by enzymes in the body. This can result in the formation of toxic metabolites that can cause adverse effects.
Example: Molecule 6 has a carbonyl group which may contribute to its potential toxicity.
Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also have increased toxicity due to their ability to interact with biological molecules through π-π stacking interactions. These types of compounds are often associated with mutagenic and carcinogenic activities.
Example: Molecule 8 has two phenyl rings which could increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: Compounds with a high degree of lipophilicity tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues such as the brain and liver, leading to potential toxicity. Therefore, molecules with a high logP value (a measure of hydrophobicity) should be evaluated for potential toxicity.
Example: Molecule 9 has a relatively high logP value compared to other compounds in the dataset, indicating that it may have higher potential for accumulation in lipid-rich tissues.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of functional groups such as -COOH or -OH in the structure of the molecule, then it may lead to adverse effects. This rule is based on the fact that these functional groups can interact with other molecules and disrupt their normal functioning. For example, in the first SMILES string, the presence of the -COOH group may cause irritation upon contact with skin.
Rule 2: If the molecular weight of the compound is high, then it may also lead to adverse effects. This rule is based on the fact that larger compounds have more atoms and therefore more potential for interaction with other molecules. For example, in the second SMILES string, the molecular weight of the compound is relatively high at 901 g/mol which may make it difficult to excrete from the body leading to accumulation and potential toxicity.
Rule 3: If the compound contains metals or metal ions, then it may also lead to adverse effects. This rule is based on the fact that metals can react with other molecules and disrupt their normal functioning. For example, in the sixth SMILES string, the presence of iron ions may cause oxidative stress leading to cellular damage.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the sulfonamide group present in the second SMILES string may be associated with allergic reactions or other adverse effects. Therefore, if a molecule contains such groups, it should be carefully evaluated for potential risks.
Rule 2: The length and complexity of a molecule may also affect its ability to cause adverse effects. Generally, longer and more complex molecules tend to have lower bioavailability and higher toxicity. Therefore, simpler molecules may be less likely to cause adverse effects than more complex ones.

The presence of this functional group increases the reactivity of the molecule and can lead to toxic reactions or side effects. For example, in the first SMILES string, the molecule contains a nitro group and has been labeled as having potential side-effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it may also have potential side-effects. This functional group is known for its antimicrobial properties but can also cause allergic reactions or other health problems. For instance, in the fourth SMILES string, the molecule contains a sulfonamide group and has been labeled as potentially causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (-Cl) or fluorine (-F), it may be associated with toxicity issues. These atoms can disrupt normal cell functions and lead to negative health outcomes.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as "CCON" or "CCCN" in its structure, it may have potential side effects. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine in its structure, it may also have potential side effects. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule does not contain any of these groups but has a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms, it may still have potential side effects. This rule applies to some molecules labeled as both 0 and 1 in the dataset.
It's important to note that these rules are just suggestions and should not be used as the only criteria for predicting side effects. It's always best to consult with experts in the field before making any decisions.

================================

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have label 1 indicating their association with side-effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. The third molecule in the dataset contains this group and it also has label 1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. The fifth and sixth molecules in the dataset contain these atoms and they both have label 1.
It's important to note that these rules are based on limited data and should be used cautiously. Further research and testing would be needed to confirm their validity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects or not based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have potential side effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the first molecule in the dataset contains a sulfonamide group and is labeled as "1" because it has been shown to have potential side effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects. This rule also applies to molecules labeled as "1" in the dataset. The second molecule in the dataset contains a nitro group and is labeled as "1" due to its known side effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a gadolinium ion (Gd+3), then it may have potential side effects. This rule only applies to one molecule in the dataset, which is labeled as "1" for having potential side effects. However, this rule should be taken with caution since there is limited evidence supporting the link between Gd+3 and side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a phosphorus atom and two negatively charged oxygen atoms in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to the first SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom and a carbonyl group in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to the third SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom and a sulfur atom in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to the last SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 1.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the dataset and should be used cautiously until further research is conducted.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecular structure, then it may lead to potential adverse effects. The presence of this functional group may increase the reactivity and toxicity of the compound. Therefore, molecules containing such groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring, especially if it is substituted with electron-withdrawing groups like -NO2 or -COOH, then it may also contribute to potential adverse effects. These substituents can increase the reactivity of the aromatic ring, leading to increased toxicity.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may have potential adverse effects due to its ability to inhibit certain enzymes involved in various metabolic processes. This inhibition can lead to serious health problems including skin rashes, liver damage, and kidney failure.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of negatively charged atoms such as oxygen and sulfur in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects. This rule can be applied by analyzing the chemical structure of the compounds and identifying any negatively charged atoms present. For example, the first compound in the list contains two sodium ions which may contribute to its potential toxicity.
Rule 2: Compounds containing functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, and nitriles have a higher probability of causing adverse effects compared to those without these groups. These groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions. For instance, the fifth compound in the list has a ketone group which may increase its reactivity and ability to bind to proteins.
Rule 3: Molecules with aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds are more likely to cause adverse effects due to their increased stability and tendency to react with other molecules. For example, the thirteenth compound in the list has a benzene ring which may enhance its interaction with biological targets.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) and a nitro group (NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The first example in the dataset contains both these groups and is labeled as having adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a nitrogen atom, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. The second example in the dataset contains this feature and is labeled as having adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and a double bond between two carbon atoms, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects. The third example in the dataset contains these features but is labeled as not having adverse effects.
