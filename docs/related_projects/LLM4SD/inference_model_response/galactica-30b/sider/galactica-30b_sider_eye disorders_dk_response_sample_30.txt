Rule 1: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) in the structure of a molecule may indicate its potential to cause eye disorders as seen in SMILES strings labeled as 1 for molecules CN1CCN2C(C1)C3=CC=CC=C3CC4=C2N=CC=C4 and COC1=CC2=C(C=CN=C2C=C1OC)OC3=CC=C(C=C3)NC(=O)C4(CC4)C(=O)NC5=CC=C(C=C5)F. However, this rule alone cannot be used to accurately predict the side effects of a molecule since other factors such as dosage, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility also play a role.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an aromatic ring or another electron-withdrawing group like -CF, -NF, etc. may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects due to increased reactivity and toxicity. This is evident from the fact that all molecules labeled as 1 contain at least one carbonyl group along with other functional groups like -NH, -OH, -SH, etc. which increase their overall polarity and reactivity. For example, in SMILES string CCC[C@]1(CC(=O)C(=C(O1)[O-])[C@H](CC)C2=CC(=CC=C2)[N-]S(=O)(=O)C3=NC=C(C=C3)C(F)(F)F)CCC4=CC=CC=C4.[Na+].[Na+], the presence of two sodium ions indicates high ionic character and suggests possible interaction with biological systems leading to toxic effects.
Rule 3: Molecules having a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring or an aliphatic chain tend to exhibit strong oxidizing properties and may cause adverse health effects including skin irritation

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1=CC(=CN=C1)C(=O)NCCO[N+](=O)[O-] 1, CC(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C 1, CCS(=O)(=O)O 1, CNS(=O)(=O)CC1=CC2=C(C=C1)NC=C2CCN(C)C 1, CCC1(C(=O)NCNC1=O)C2=CC=CC=C2 1, COC1=C2C(=CC3=C1OC=C3)C=CC(=O)O2 0, and CS(=O)(=O)O 1.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a conjugated system consisting of alternating single and double bonds, such as in the case of a phenyl ring, then it may also have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings I 1, CC1=C(N=C(N=C1N)C(CC(=O)N)NCC(C(=O)N)N)C(=O)NC(C(C2=CN=CN2)O[C@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](O3)CO)O)O

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the eyes.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to toxic effects. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles.
Rule 2: Compounds with aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also exhibit toxicity towards the eyes due to their ability to absorb UV radiation and generate reactive oxygen species.
Explanation: Exposure to sunlight or artificial light sources can trigger phototoxicity reactions in the eyes, which can lead to inflammation and tissue damage. Aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds are known to enhance the absorption of UV radiation by compounds, making them more susceptible to phototoxic effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with high molecular weight and complex structures may have limited bioavailability and penetration into ocular tissues, resulting in reduced efficacy and increased risk of adverse effects.
Explanation: Large and complex molecules may require longer periods of time to reach therapeutic concentrations within the target organs, increasing the likelihood of off-target interactions and adverse events. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the selection of appropriate drug delivery systems and formulation strategies to optimize the pharmacokinetic profile of these molecules.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) and a carbonyl group (C=O), then it may have potential side effects on eyes. The given SMILES strings containing SO2R and C=O groups should be labeled as 1 for their possible association with eye disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure has a nitro group (NO2) attached to an aromatic ring or an aliphatic chain, then it may also have potential side effects on eyes. The second SMILES string in the dataset contains NO2 group and should be labeled as 1.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure includes a guanidine group (-C(NR)(NR')C-), then it may have potential side effects on eyes. The fifth SMILES string in the dataset contains this functional group and should be labeled as 1.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have label 1 indicating their association with eye disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains halogen atoms such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine in its structure, then it may also have the potential to cause eye disorders. The third and fifth molecules in the dataset contain halogens and they both have label 1 indicating their association with eye disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a benzene ring in its structure, then it may also have the potential to cause eye disorders. The seventh molecule in the dataset contains a benzene ring and it has label 1 indicating its association with eye disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to eye disorders:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders. The first example in the dataset meets this criterion, as it contains both a nitro group and a sulfonyl group.
Rule 2: If a compound contains two or more nitrogen atoms bonded together in a ring structure, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders. This rule applies to the second example in the dataset, which contains a pyrimidine ring.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a guanidine group (-C(NH2)=NR), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to eye disorders. This rule applies to the third example in the dataset, which contains a guanidine group.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders as a side effect:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders as a side effect. This is because these functional groups are commonly found in drugs that are known to cause eye irritation or damage. The first example in the dataset meets this rule.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl) and a nitrogen atom (N) in its structure, then it may also have the potential to cause eye disorders as a side effect. This is because Cl and N atoms are often present in pharmaceuticals that are known to irritate the eyes. The third example in the dataset meets this rule.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom (F) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders as a side effect. This is because F and C=O are both common features in drugs that are known to cause eye irritation or damage. The fifth example in the dataset meets this rule.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the eyes.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to toxic effects. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles.
Rule 2: Compounds with aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also exhibit toxicity towards the eyes due to their ability to absorb UV radiation and generate reactive oxygen species.
Explanation: Exposure to sunlight or artificial light sources can trigger phototoxicity reactions in the eyes, which can lead to inflammation and tissue damage. Aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds are known to enhance the absorption of UV radiation by compounds, making them more susceptible to phototoxic effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with high molecular weight and complex structures may have limited bioavailability and penetration into ocular tissues, resulting in reduced efficacy and increased risk of adverse effects.
Explanation: Large and complex molecules may require longer periods of time to reach therapeutic concentrations within the target organs, increasing the likelihood of off-target interactions and adverse events. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the selection of appropriate drug delivery systems and formulation strategies to optimize the pharmacokinetic profile of these molecules.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of Gd+3 in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on eyes.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains fluorine atom and has a functional group like -COOH or -OH attached to it, then it may have potential adverse effects on eyes.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have potential adverse effects on eyes.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of chlorine atom in the structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on eyes. The given SMILES string has a chlorine atom and hence it belongs to class 1.
Rule 2: If there is a presence of a functional group like "-COOH" or "-OH" attached to the carbon chain, then it may also contribute to the adverse effects on eyes. However, this rule cannot be applied for all cases as some molecules having these groups do not have any adverse effects. Therefore, further analysis needs to be done before making any conclusion based on this rule.
Rule 3: If the molecular weight of the compound is less than 500 Daltons, then it may have low solubility in water which leads to poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract resulting in lower bioavailability. This could potentially affect its efficacy and safety profile leading to potential adverse effects. However, again, this rule should only be used as a general guideline and not as a definitive predictor of toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfhydryl group and carbonyl group in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on eyes.
Explanation: The first three molecules contain sulfur atoms which form sulfhydryl groups. These compounds have been reported to cause eye irritation or damage. Additionally, all three molecules also contain carbonyl groups which can react with proteins in the body leading to tissue damage. Therefore, these functional groups may be responsible for their observed side-effects.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings and nitro groups may have a higher likelihood of causing eye disorders.
Explanation: The fourth molecule contains two phenyl rings connected by a nitrogen atom. Phenyl rings are known to be toxic and can irritate the skin and eyes. Nitro groups are also known to be toxic and can cause inflammation and tissue damage. Therefore, this combination of structural features may contribute to the observed side-effects of this compound.
Rule 3: Compounds containing metal ions may have a greater tendency to cause eye disorders due to their ability to interact with biological systems.
Explanation: The fifth molecule contains gold atoms which are known to be highly reactive. This reactivity may lead to interactions with biomolecules within the body resulting in toxicity. Furthermore, the sixth molecule contains iron ions which can participate in redox reactions leading to oxidative stress and tissue damage. Therefore, the presence of metal ions in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on eyes.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to eye disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure "COCCOC(=O)NCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)NCCCCCOP(=O)(C)O)NC(=O)OCCOC" or any of its variations, then it is likely to have side-effect activity related to eye disorders and should be labeled as 1. This rule takes into account the presence of certain functional groups and their arrangement within the molecule, which may contribute to its biological activity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure "CCC1(C2=C(COC1=O)C(=O)N3CC4=C(C3=C2)N=C5C=CC(=C(C5=C4)CN(C)C)O)O" or any of its variations, then it is unlikely to have side-effect activity related to eye disorders and should be labeled as 0. This rule considers the absence of specific structural features that may be associated with toxicity or other undesirable activities.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains the substructure "C[C@@H]1CCO[C@@H]2N1C(=O)C3=C(C(=O)C(=CN3C2)C(=O)NCC4=C(C=C(C=C4)F)F)[O-].[Na+]" or any of its variations, then it is also unlikely to have side-effect activity related to eye disorders and should be labeled as 0. This rule takes into account the presence of sodium ions, which may indicate that the molecule is highly polar and may interact unfavorably with biological systems.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders as a side effect:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders as a side effect. This is because these functional groups are commonly found in drugs that are known to cause eye irritation or damage. The first example in the dataset meets this rule.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl) and a nitrogen atom (N) in its structure, then it may also have the potential to cause eye disorders as a side effect. This is because Cl and N atoms are often present in pharmaceuticals that are known to irritate the eyes. The third example in the dataset meets this rule.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom (F) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders as a side effect. This is because F and C=O are both common features in drugs that are known to cause eye irritation or damage. The fifth example in the dataset meets this rule.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of a functional group such as "C=O" or "C#N" in the molecular structure, then it may lead to potential toxicity and adverse effects on the human body. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 for their corresponding SMILES strings. For example, in the first SMILES string, the presence of "C(=O)N1CC2=CC=CC=C2C[C@H]1C(=O)O" indicates the possibility of causing eye disorders due to its structural similarity to known toxic compounds.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a metal ion such as platinum, it may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects. This rule also applies to molecules labeled as 1 for their corresponding SMILES strings. For instance, in the third SMILES string, the presence of "[Pt+2]" suggests that the compound could have potential therapeutic applications but may also pose risks if used improperly.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure has a high degree of symmetry and complexity, it may indicate low stability and potentially higher reactivity. This rule applies to all molecules regardless of their labels since they all contain some level of chemical complexity. However, this rule does not provide any specific information about how these structures may affect biological systems.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a chlorine atom (-Cl) attached to a benzene ring (represented by the SMILES string C6H5 in the dataset), then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by the first two SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom (-F) and a nitrogen atom (-N) bonded together in a five-membered ring (represented by the SMILES string NCF in the dataset), then it may also have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by the third SMILES string labeled as "1" in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an iodine atom (-I) bonded to each other, then it does not seem to have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by the fourth SMILES string labeled as "0" in the dataset.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having the potential to cause eye disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a benzenesulfonyl group (-SO2Ph), it may also have the potential to cause eye disorders. The second molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has also been labeled as having the potential to cause eye disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains both a sulfonamide group and a benzenesulfonyl group, it may have even greater potential to cause eye disorders. This rule is based on the fact that these two groups are often found together in drugs known to cause eye disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains both of these functional groups and has been labeled as having the greatest potential to cause eye disorders among all the molecules in the dataset.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a negatively charged atom such as sodium or lithium, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies only to one molecule in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to two molecules in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to four molecules in the dataset.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided by this small dataset and should be used cautiously until further research can confirm their validity.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, it may have potential side effects on eyes. The first two molecules in the given dataset contain both these functional groups and they are labeled as having side-effects on eyes.
Rule 2: If a compound has a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, it may also have potential side effects on eyes. The third molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and it is labeled as having side-effects on eyes.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a conjugated system of double bonds between an aromatic ring and an amide group (-CONH-), it may be less likely to have side-effects on eyes. The fourth molecule in the dataset does not contain any of the above mentioned structural features and it is labeled as not having side-effects on eyes.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the eyes. This rule can be applied to the second SMILES string where there is a sulfonamide group present which could potentially lead to eye irritation or inflammation if the compound enters the body.
Rule 2: The presence of aromatic rings in a compound may also increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the eyes due to their ability to absorb UV light and generate free radicals. This rule can be applied to the third SMILES string where there is an aromatic ring present which could potentially lead to damage to the cornea if exposed to sunlight.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a compound's structure may also play a role in determining its potential for causing adverse effects on the eyes. Compounds with longer chains or more complex structures may have greater difficulty penetrating the eye and reaching the target tissue, leading to reduced toxicity. This rule can be applied to the fifth SMILES string where the compound has a relatively simple structure compared to other compounds in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of a functional group such as "C=O" or "C#N" in the molecular structure, then it may lead to potential toxicity and adverse effects on the human body. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 for their corresponding SMILES strings. For example, in the first SMILES string, the presence of "C(=O)N1CC2=CC=CC=C2C[C@H]1C(=O)O" indicates the possibility of causing eye disorders due to its structural similarity to known toxic compounds.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a metal ion such as platinum, it may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects. This rule also applies to molecules labeled as 1 for their corresponding SMILES strings. For instance, in the third SMILES string, the presence of "[Pt+2]" suggests that the compound could have potential therapeutic applications but may also pose risks if used improperly.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure has a high degree of symmetry and complexity, it may indicate low stability and potentially higher reactivity. This rule applies to all molecules regardless of their labels since they all contain some level of chemical complexity. However, this rule does not provide any specific information about how these structures may affect biological systems.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1=CC(=CN=C1)C(=O)NCCO[N+](=O)[O-] 1, CC(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C 1, CCS(=O)(=O)O 1, CNS(=O)(=O)CC1=CC2=C(C=C1)NC=C2CCN(C)C 1, CCC1(C(=O)NCNC1=O)C2=CC=CC=C2 1, COC1=C2C(=CC3=C1OC=C3)C=CC(=O)O2 0, and CS(=O)(=O)O 1.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a conjugated system consisting of alternating single and double bonds, such as in the case of a phenyl ring, then it may also have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings I 1, CC1=C(N=C(N=C1N)C(CC(=O)N)NCC(C(=O)N)N)C(=O)NC(C(C2=CN=CN2)O[C@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](O3)CO)O)O

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds between carbon atoms, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the first molecule in the dataset contains two carbonyl groups connected through a conjugated system of double bonds, which suggests that it may have the potential to cause eye disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule also applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the fourth molecule in the dataset contains a bromine atom, which suggests that it may have the potential to cause eye disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule only applies to one molecule in the dataset, which is represented by the seventh SMILES string labeled as "1". The presence of this functional group suggests that the molecule may have the potential to cause eye disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause eye disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with CC(C1=CC(=C(C=C1)C2=CC=CC=C2)F)C(=O)O or C(C1C(C(C(C(O1)O)F)O)O)O.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sodium ion and a nitrate ion, then it may not have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with [NH+](=O)[O-].[Na+].
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom in a five-membered ring, which is also bonded to another oxygen atom, then it may have the potential to cause eye disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with CN1CCC23C4C1CC5=C2C(=C(C=C5)O)OC3C(=O)CC4 or CCCC1CC(N(C1)C)C(=O)NC(C2C(C(C(C(O2)SC)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)C(C)Cl.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the eyes. This rule can be applied to the second SMILES string where there is a sulfonamide group present which could potentially lead to eye irritation or inflammation if the compound enters the body.
Rule 2: The presence of aromatic rings in a compound may also increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the eyes due to their ability to absorb UV light and generate free radicals. This rule can be applied to the third SMILES string where there is an aromatic ring present which could potentially lead to damage to the cornea if exposed to sunlight.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a compound's structure may also play a role in determining its potential for causing adverse effects on the eyes. Compounds with longer chains or more complex structures may have greater difficulty penetrating the eye and reaching the target tissue, leading to reduced toxicity. This rule can be applied to the fifth SMILES string where the compound has a relatively simple structure compared to other compounds in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of chlorine atom in the structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on eyes. The given SMILES string has a chlorine atom and hence it belongs to class 1.
Rule 2: If there is a presence of a functional group like "-COOH" or "-OH" attached to the carbon chain, then it may also contribute to the adverse effects on eyes. However, this rule cannot be applied for all cases as some molecules having these groups do not have any adverse effects. Therefore, further analysis needs to be done before making any conclusion based on this rule.
Rule 3: If the molecular weight of the compound is less than 500 Daltons, then it may have low solubility in water which leads to poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract resulting in lower bioavailability. This could potentially affect its efficacy and safety profile leading to potential adverse effects. However, again, this rule should only be used as a general guideline and not as a definitive predictor of toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a conjugated system of double bonds and has a negative charge on one oxygen atom, then it may have side effects related to eye disorders. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it has a conjugated system of double bonds between carbon atoms C1, C2, C3, and C4, and two sodium ions bonded to each other at opposite ends of the molecule. This creates a dipole moment which could interact with charged molecules or tissues in the body causing potential side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to a nitrogen atom, then it may not have any side effects related to eye disorders. The third molecule in the dataset violates this rule as it has a cyanamide group (-NH-CN) attached to a nitrogen atom instead of a simple cyano group. Cyanamides are known for their toxic properties and may cause adverse reactions if ingested or inhaled.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have side effects related to eye disorders. The fifth molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it has a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O). Chlorine atoms are often present in pharmaceuticals and can affect their biological activity by altering their chemical properties. However, further research would be needed to determine how exactly they contribute to side effects related to eye disorders.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of chlorine atom in the structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on eyes. The given SMILES string has a chlorine atom and hence it belongs to class 1.
Rule 2: If there is a presence of a functional group like "-COOH" or "-OH" attached to the carbon chain, then it may also contribute to the adverse effects on eyes. However, this rule cannot be applied for all cases as some molecules having these groups do not have any adverse effects. Therefore, further analysis needs to be done before making any conclusion based on this rule.
Rule 3: If the molecular weight of the compound is less than 500 Daltons, then it may have low solubility in water which leads to poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract resulting in lower bioavailability. This could potentially affect its efficacy and safety profile leading to potential adverse effects. However, again, this rule should only be used as a general guideline and not as a definitive predictor of toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) in the structure of a molecule may indicate its potential to cause eye disorders as seen in SMILES strings labeled as 1 for molecules CN1CCN2C(C1)C3=CC=CC=C3CC4=C2N=CC=C4 and COC1=CC2=C(C=CN=C2C=C1OC)OC3=CC=C(C=C3)NC(=O)C4(CC4)C(=O)NC5=CC=C(C=C5)F. However, this rule alone cannot be used to accurately predict the side effects of a molecule since other factors such as dosage, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility also play a role.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an aromatic ring or another electron-withdrawing group like -CF, -NF, etc. may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects due to increased reactivity and toxicity. This is evident from the fact that all molecules labeled as 1 contain at least one carbonyl group along with other functional groups like -NH, -OH, -SH, etc. which increase their overall polarity and reactivity. For example, in SMILES string CCC[C@]1(CC(=O)C(=C(O1)[O-])[C@H](CC)C2=CC(=CC=C2)[N-]S(=O)(=O)C3=NC=C(C=C3)C(F)(F)F)CCC4=CC=CC=C4.[Na+].[Na+], the presence of two sodium ions indicates high ionic character and suggests possible interaction with biological systems leading to toxic effects.
Rule 3: Molecules having a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring or an aliphatic chain tend to exhibit strong oxidizing properties and may cause adverse health effects including skin irritation

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) and a carbonyl group (C=O), then it may have potential side effects on eyes. The given SMILES strings containing SO2R and C=O groups should be labeled as 1 for their possible association with eye disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure has a nitro group (NO2) attached to an aromatic ring or an aliphatic chain, then it may also have potential side effects on eyes. The second SMILES string in the dataset contains NO2 group and should be labeled as 1.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure includes a guanidine group (-C(NR)(NR')C-), then it may have potential side effects on eyes. The fifth SMILES string in the dataset contains this functional group and should be labeled as 1.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a cyano group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) in close proximity, then it may have potential side effects on eyes. The presence of these functional groups may increase the likelihood of causing eye disorders such as cataracts or macular degeneration.
Example: Label 1 for SMILES string "CCN(CC)C(=O)[C@@]1(C[C@@H]1C[NH3+])C2=CC=CC=C2.[Cl-]"
Rule 2: If the molecular structure has two aromatic rings connected by a nitrogen atom, then it may also have potential side effects on eyes. This type of structure may disrupt the normal function of proteins within the eye, leading to visual impairments.
Example: Label 1 for SMILES string "CC1=NC=CN1CC2CCC3=C(C2=O)C4=CC=CC=C4N3C 1"
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a conjugated system consisting of multiple double bonds and carbonyl groups, then it may be more likely to cause skin irritation upon exposure. This type of structure may interact with skin cells and cause inflammation or other adverse reactions.
Example: Label 0 for SMILES string "CC1=CC(=CC(=C1NC2=NC(=NC=C2)NC3=CC=C(C=C3)C#N)C)C=CC#N 0"
