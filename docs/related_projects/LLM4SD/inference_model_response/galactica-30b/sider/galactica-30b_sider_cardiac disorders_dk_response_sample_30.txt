Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as OP(=O)(O)[O-] or CNC1(CCCCC1=O)C2=CC=CC=C2Cl, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a functional group such as CN(C)CCC=C1C2=CC=CC=C2COC3=C1C=C(C=C3)CC(=O)O.Cl, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a functional group such as CC1=CC(=C(C=C1)SC2=CC=CC=C2N3CCNCC3)C, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
Note that these rules are just examples and should not be used as the only criteria for predicting adverse effects. It's important to consider other factors such as dosage, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility when evaluating the safety of a molecule.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in a molecule has been linked to cardiotoxicity and other adverse effects. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for potential toxicity.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule can also affect its ability to interact with biological targets and potentially cause adverse effects. Molecules with a larger surface area or more flexible structures may have greater access to target sites within cells and tissues, increasing their potential for interaction and toxicity. Therefore, molecules with smaller or less flexible structures may be safer to use.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule can also play a role in its toxicity. For example, some chiral drugs may have different activities depending on their configuration, leading to differences in potency and safety. Therefore, it is important to consider the stereochemical properties of a molecule when evaluating its potential risks and benefits.
