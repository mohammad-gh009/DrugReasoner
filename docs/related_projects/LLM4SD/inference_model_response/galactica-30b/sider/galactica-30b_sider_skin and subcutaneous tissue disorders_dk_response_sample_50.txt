Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25, #26, #27, #28, #29, #30, #31, #32, #33, #34, #35, #36, #37, #38, #39, #40, #41, #42, #43, #44, #45, #46, #47, #48, #49, #50, #51, #52, 

================================

Rule 1: The presence of gadolinium ion in the molecular structure indicates potential for causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Rule 2: A molecule containing chlorine atoms may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues compared to molecules without chlorine atoms.
Rule 3: Molecules containing functional groups such as carbonyl, carboxyl, or nitro groups may be more likely to cause adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues than those without these groups.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels of 1 indicating their ability to cause such effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (-C=O) through a single bond, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to the third molecule in the dataset which has a label of 1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. The last four molecules in the dataset all contain halogens and they all have labels of 0 indicating their inability to cause such effects.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of bromine atoms in the molecular structure, then it may lead to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders as they are known to be toxic and can irritate the skin. Therefore, if a compound contains bromine atom(s), it should be labeled as 1 for potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Rule 2: If a compound has a nitro group (-NO2) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), it may have some reactivity towards other molecules which could potentially result in adverse reactions such as allergic reactions or toxicity. Hence, compounds containing these functional groups should also be labeled as 1 for possible side effects.
Rule 3: Compounds having aromatic rings in their structures tend to be more stable due to resonance stabilization but at the same time, they can also act as haptens and cause allergic reactions in certain individuals. Thus, compounds possessing aromatic ring(s) should also be considered as potential candidates for causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a compound increases its likelihood of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders as a side effect. This rule applies to compounds C1[C@@H]([C@@H]2[C@H](O1)[C@@H](CO2)O[N+](=O)[O-])O, CC(CCCC(C)(C)O)C1CCC2C1(CCCC2=CC=C3CC(CC(C3=C)O)O)C, CN(CCOC1=CC=C(C=C1)CC2C(=O)NC(=O)S2)C3=CC=CC=N3, OP(=O)(O)[O-], CCC12CCC3C(C1CCC2=O)CCC4=C3C=CC(=C4)O, and O=P(O)(O)OH.
Rule 2: Compounds containing a sulfhydryl group (-SH) or disulfide bond (-SS-) have a higher chance of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders than those without them. This rule applies to compounds C1C(C(OC1N2C=NC3=C2N=C(N=C3N)Cl)CO)O, CCS(C)(=O)Cc1ccc(cc1)Oc1ccccc1Nc2ccc(cc2)NS(=O)(=O)c3ccc(cc

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amides, and sulfoxides in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues due to their ability to absorb UV radiation from sunlight.
Rule 3: Compounds with molecular weights greater than 500 Daltons or those that contain heavy metals such as lead, mercury, or cadmium may be more likely to cause adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues due to their ability to penetrate deeper into the skin layers.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) or carboxylic acid group (COOH) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Explanation: These functional groups can interact with proteins and enzymes present in the skin and subcutaneous tissues, leading to irritation, inflammation, and other adverse reactions.
Rule 2: A compound containing multiple rings or aromatic structures may have higher probability of causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues due to their ability to penetrate the skin barrier more easily than non-aromatic compounds.
Explanation: Aromatic rings can form π-π interactions with protein molecules, which can lead to increased binding affinity and toxicity.
Rule 3: Compounds containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine may also be associated with increased risk of adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. This may be due to their ability to disrupt cellular processes by interacting with proteins and enzymes.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of chlorine atoms in the structure of the molecule, then it may have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. The presence of halogen atoms like chlorine can increase the lipophilicity of the compound which can lead to increased penetration through the stratum corneum layer of the skin. This can result in irritation or allergic reactions. Therefore, molecules containing chlorine should be carefully evaluated for their potential side effects on these tissues.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. Nitro compounds can cause skin sensitization, irritation, and corrosion due to their oxidizing nature. They can also act as photosensitizers leading to phototoxicity. Therefore, molecules containing nitro groups should also be carefully evaluated for their potential side effects on these tissues.
Rule 3: If the molecule has a carbonyl group (-C=O) present in its structure, then it may have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. Carbonyl compounds can react with amino acids and proteins resulting in protein cross-linking and denaturation. This can lead to inflammation and tissue damage. Therefore, molecules containing carbonyl groups should also be carefully evaluated for their potential side effects on these tissues.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a pyridine ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a phosphate group (PO4R), it may have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues due to their irritant nature. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be labeled as having potential side effects in this category.
Example: C(CC(O)(P(=O)(O)O)P(=O)(O)O)CN has a phosphate group and therefore should be labeled as having potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Rule 2: Compounds containing iodine atoms may also have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues because they can act as disinfectants and antiseptics. Therefore, compounds containing iodine atoms should also be labeled as having potential side effects in this category.
Example: COC(=O)[C@@H]1[C@H]2CCC(N2CCCF)C[C@@H]1C3=CC=C(C=C3)I has an iodine atom and therefore should be labeled as having potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Rule 3: Compounds containing gadolinium ions (Gd3+) may also have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues due to their ability to cause allergic reactions. Therefore, compounds containing Gd3+ should also be labeled as having potential side effects in this category.
Example: [H+].[H+].CNC[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](CO)O)O)O)O.CNC[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](CO)O)O)O)O.C1=CC=C(C=C1)COCC(C(=O)[O-])N(CCN(CCN(CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-].[Gd+3] has a Gd3+ ion and therefore should be labeled as having potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a chloro group attached to a benzene ring or any other aromatic system, then it may have potential side effects on the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The presence of chlorine atom in the chemical structure increases its reactivity towards biological systems leading to toxic effects. Therefore, molecules containing such functional groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure has a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with another double bond, then it may also exhibit similar side effects as mentioned above due to increased reactivity. Such structures should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles before being used in drug development processes.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring like pyridine, pyrimidine, etc., then it may potentially interact with DNA and RNA resulting in mutagenic and carcinogenic effects. These types of compounds should be cautiously evaluated during preclinical studies to ensure their safe use.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.

Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a sulfate group (-OSO3-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72,

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, nitro, or carbonyl groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to bind to proteins and enzymes in the body, which can lead to irritation or inflammation of these tissues.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also be associated with increased risk of adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Explanation: These structural features can enhance the reactivity of the compound, making it more likely to interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions.
Rule 3: Compounds with molecular weights greater than 500 Daltons may have lower bioavailability and penetration into skin and subcutaneous tissues, resulting in reduced likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Explanation: Larger compounds may have slower absorption rates and less efficient transport across cell membranes compared to smaller ones, reducing their potential to cause harm.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a carbonyl group (COR), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the first molecule in the dataset contains both a sulfonyl group and a carbonyl group, which suggests that it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" in the dataset. For example, the fifth molecule in the dataset contains a nitro group but does not appear to have any potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl) bonded to an aromatic ring, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule also applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" in the dataset. For example, the eighth molecule in the dataset contains a chlorine atom bonded to an aromatic ring but does not appear to have any potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) in the structure may indicate potential skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders as a side effect. This rule applies to the first SMILES string provided where there is a cyano group present on the nitrogen atom.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) attached to an aromatic ring, it may also contribute to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to the second SMILES string provided where there is a sulfonyl group present on the oxygen atom.
Rule 3: If the molecule has a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen group such as chlorine (-Cl) or fluorine (-F) attached to an aromatic ring, it may increase the likelihood of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to the third SMILES string provided where there is a nitro group present on one of the carbon atoms and the fourth SMILES string provided where there is a chlorine group present on one of the carbon atoms.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amides, and amines in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. These functional groups can interact with proteins or other molecules in the body, leading to irritation or inflammation.
Rule 2: A compound containing halogen atoms such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine may also have the potential to cause adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. Halogen atoms can act as electrophilic agents, reacting with nucleophilic sites on proteins or other molecules in the body, leading to cell damage or death.
Rule 3: Compounds containing sulfur or phosphorus atoms may also be associated with adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. Sulfur-containing compounds such as sulfoxides and sulfones can irritate the skin and mucous membranes, while phosphorous-containing compounds such as phosphoric acid and its derivatives can cause burns and irritation.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (C=O) in its structure, then it may have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If a compound has a functional group such as a double bond or triple bond between carbon atoms, it may also have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1.
Rule 3: If a compound contains nitrogen atoms in its structure, especially in the form of a heterocyclic ring, it may be more likely to cause adverse reactions than other types of molecules. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings labeled as either 0 or 1, but it is important to note that this rule alone does not guarantee that the compound will cause any specific side effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to bind to proteins and enzymes in the body, leading to irritation or inflammation of these tissues.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds may also be associated with increased risk of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Explanation: These structural features can enhance the compound's ability to penetrate the skin barrier and interact with cells and tissues.
Rule 3: Compounds with molecular weights greater than 500 Daltons may have limited penetration through the skin and therefore lower potential for causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Explanation: Larger molecules may require more time and energy to cross the skin barrier, reducing their likelihood of reaching deeper layers of the skin and causing harm.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional groups such as -COOH or -OH in a compound, then it may have potential for causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the given dataset. For example, the first molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) which could potentially lead to irritation or inflammation if exposed to the skin.
Rule 2: If a compound has a nitro group (-NO2) attached to its structure, it may also pose a risk of causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. This rule can be applied to the second molecule in the dataset where the nitro group is present. The presence of this group can cause irritation and redness upon contact with the skin.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a fluorine atom (-F), it may increase the lipophilicity of the molecule and enhance its ability to penetrate through the skin barrier. This rule can be applied to the third molecule in the dataset where the fluorine atom is present. However, it should be noted that the presence of fluorine atoms does not necessarily indicate that a compound will cause adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. Other factors such as concentration, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility must also be considered.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules #8, #9, #17, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25, #26, #27, #28, #29, #30, #31, #32, #33, #34, #35, #36, #37, #38, #39, #40, #41, #42, #43, #44, #45, #46, #47, #48, #49, #50, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #57, #58, #59, #60, #61, 

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of halogen atoms like chlorine or bromine in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on human health due to their high reactivity. Therefore, molecules containing these elements should be labeled as 1.
Example: Label 1 for CC1=CC(=C(N1)C=C2C3=CC=CC=C3NC2=O)C because it contains one chlorine atom.
Rule 2: If the molecule has a functional group such as nitro or carbonyl groups, they can cause allergic reactions or irritation to the skin and tissues. Hence, molecules having these groups should also be labeled as 1.
Example: Label 1 for C1=CC(=CC=C1CSC(CN2C=CN=C2)C3=C(C=C(C=C3)Cl)Cl)Cl because it possesses a nitro group.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a heterocyclic ring system, it may have some biological activities which could affect its toxicity level. For example, if the molecule contains a pyridine ring, it may act as a chelating agent and bind to metal ions, leading to potential toxic effects. Thus, molecules possessing this type of rings should be labeled as 1.
Example: Label 1 for CCCNS(=O)(=O)NC1=C(C(=NC=N1)OCCOC2=NC=C(C=N2)Br)C3=CC=C(C=C3)Br because it contains a pyridine ring.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional groups such as aldehydes or ketones in a compound, then it may have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. The molecular structure of this type of compounds often contains polar bonds which make them more likely to interact with water molecules present in the body's cells leading to irritation or inflammation. Therefore, these types of compounds should be avoided if possible when designing new drugs for topical use.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings like benzene or naphthalene may also exhibit irritant or allergic reactions upon exposure to the skin. These types of structures tend to be lipophilic and can easily penetrate through the stratum corneum layer of the epidermis causing irritation or sensitization. Hence, it is important to consider the presence of aromatic rings while designing drug candidates for transdermal delivery.
Rule 3: A compound having a nitro group attached to its structure may pose a risk of inducing skin and subcutaenous tissue disorder due to its ability to release nitric oxide gas under certain conditions. This gas can act as a vasodilator and increase blood flow resulting in redness, swelling, and pain at the site of contact. Therefore, caution must be taken during the development process of any pharmaceutical product containing nitro compounds.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide, carboxylic acid, or amide in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to bind to proteins and disrupt their normal function, which could lead to irritation or inflammation of the skin.
Rule 2: A compound containing a positively charged ion, such as ammonium or silver, has a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues compared to neutral compounds.
Explanation: Positively charged ions can interact more strongly with negatively charged molecules found in the skin, leading to increased penetration and potentially harmful reactions.
Rule 3: Compounds with a high degree of lipophilicity, meaning they tend to dissolve in fats rather than water, may be more likely to penetrate the skin and cause adverse effects.
Explanation: Lipophilic compounds can easily pass through the lipid layers of the skin and enter the bloodstream, where they can cause systemic toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular formula contains chlorine or sodium ions, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. This rule applies to molecules in rows 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, and 18.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains iodine atoms, then it may have a low probability of causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. This rule applies to molecules in row 5.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains nitrogen atoms and no other elements, then it may have a moderate probability of causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. This rule applies to molecules in rows 2, 8, and 15.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. For example, the presence of sulfur atoms or aromatic rings in a compound may enhance its ability to penetrate the skin barrier and interact with cells. Therefore, molecules containing these moieties should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxicity towards skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Rule 2: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound may also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. Compounds with high molecular weights and hydrophobicities may have difficulty penetrating the skin barrier and reaching target sites within the body. Therefore, compounds with low molecular weights and hydrophilic functionalities may be more likely to cause adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a compound may also affect its ability to cause adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. For instance, chiral molecules may exhibit different biological activities depending on their configuration. Therefore, enantiomers and diastereomers of a given compound should be evaluated separately for their potential toxicity towards skin and subcutaneous tissues.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have potential side effects related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring and a nitrogen atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to the second SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 1.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a cyano group connected to a cyclopentadiene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to the third SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 1.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the dataset and should be used cautiously until further research is conducted.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amides, and sulfoxides in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to form hydrogen bonds or other types of intermolecular interactions with proteins and other molecules present in the body's cells, which can lead to irritation or inflammation of these tissues.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also be more likely to cause adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues due to their ability to absorb UV radiation from sunlight and generate reactive oxygen species that damage cellular components.
Explanation: Exposure to ultraviolet light can cause skin cancer and premature aging by damaging DNA and other macromolecules within cells. Compounds that absorb UV radiation can exacerbate this process and contribute to the development of these conditions.
Rule 3: Molecules with high molecular weight or complex structures may have lower solubility in water and higher lipophilicity, which can make them more likely to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues like skin and subcutaneous tissues and cause adverse effects.
Explanation: Many drugs and other chemicals that cause adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues are lipophilic and tend to accumulate in these tissues over time. This can lead to chronic inflammation, irritation, and other types of damage.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in a compound increases its likelihood of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders as a side effect. This rule applies to compounds with SMILES strings starting with "CCSNC1ccc2nnc(n2cccn1)Sc2ccccc2" or "CCONHC1ccc2nnc(n2cccn1)Sc2ccccc2".
Rule 2: Compounds containing a nitro group (-NO2) have a higher chance of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders if they also contain a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine attached to a carbon atom adjacent to the nitro group. This rule applies to compounds with SMILES strings starting with "CC1=C(C(=NO2)C3=C(C=CC=C3Br)F)C(=O)NC3C4N(C3=O)C(C(S4)(C)C)C(=O)O" or "CC1=C(C(=NO2)C2=C(C=CC=C2Cl)F)C(=O)NC3C4N(C3=O)C(C(S4)(C)C)C(=O)O".
Rule 3: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a sulfur atom bonded to another non-hydrogen atom, then it has a high probability of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to compounds with SMILES strings starting with "CCNS(=O

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a compound may increase its potential for causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to compounds such as C1CC2=CC=CC=C2N(C(=O)[C@H]1N[C@H](CCC3=CC=CC=C3)C(=O)O)CC(=O)O 1 and COCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCC

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. For example, the sulfonamide group present in the first SMILES string could be responsible for the observed side-effects. Similarly, the nitro group present in the second SMILES string could also contribute to the adverse effects.
Rule 2: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a molecule may also play a role in determining its potential to cause adverse effects. Molecules with higher molecular weights and greater hydrophobicities may have better penetration into the skin layers and potentially cause more severe reactions. Therefore, molecules with lower molecular weights and less hydrophobicities may be less likely to cause such effects.
Rule 3: The presence of specific substructures or motifs in a molecule may also indicate its potential to cause adverse effects. For instance, the thiazole ring present in the third SMILES string has been associated with skin irritation and allergic reactions. Additionally, the presence of metal ions like iron in the last SMILES string suggests that the molecule may interact with biological systems in a way that leads to toxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1C(C1N)C2=CC=CC=C2 1 and OP(=O)([O-])[O-].[K+].[K+] 0. These structures contain sulfonamide and nitro groups respectively, which are known to cause skin irritation and allergic reactions.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a guanidine group (-C(=NH2)NR2R3), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CN1CCN(CC1)C(=O)OC2C3=NC=CN=C3C(=O)N2C4=NC=C(C=C4)Cl 1 and CC/C=C/CC(=O)N[C@@H](CC1=CC=C(C=C1)O)C(=O)N[C@@H](C)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC(=O)O)C(=O)N[C@@H](C)C(=O)N[C@@H]([C@@H](C)CC)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC2=CC=CC=C2)C(=O)N[C@@H]([C@@H](C)O)C(=O)N[C

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), it may have potential side effects on the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The presence of these functional groups in a molecule increases its ability to penetrate the skin barrier and interact with cells, leading to irritation or allergic reactions. Therefore, compounds containing such groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: Compounds with conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings tend to absorb light energy and undergo chemical changes upon exposure to UV radiation. This property makes them potentially harmful to human health when exposed to sunlight for extended periods. Therefore, sunscreen products often contain organic molecules with strong absorption bands in the UVA and UVB regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Rule 3: Molecules with high lipophilicity (i.e., they prefer to dissolve in nonpolar solvents like lipids) are more likely to accumulate in adipose tissues and organs than hydrophilic ones. This characteristic can lead to long-term toxicity and chronic diseases. Therefore, drugs and other chemicals with high logP values (a measure of hydrophobicity) should be used cautiously and at low concentrations.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as -COOH or -OH, it may cause skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders if it reacts with other molecules in the body. This rule applies to the first two SMILES strings labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains conjugated double bonds, it may cause skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders due to its ability to absorb light energy and generate reactive oxygen species. This rule applies to the third SMILES string labeled as 1.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a heterocyclic ring, it may cause skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders because some heterocycles have photosensitizing properties which can lead to cell damage when exposed to sunlight. This rule applies to the fourth SMILES string labeled as 1.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a compound increases its likelihood of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to compounds with the SMILES string C[C@H]1C[C@@H]2[C@H](CC[C@]3([C@H]2CC[C@@]3(C(=O)C)O)C)[C@@]4(C1=CC(=O)CC4)C 1 or CC(C)(C)NCC(C1=CC(=CC(=C1)O)O)O 1.
Rule 2: Compounds containing a phosphate group have a higher chance of causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. This rule applies to compounds with the SMILES string CCCCCCN(C)CCC(O)(P(=O)(O)O)P(=O)(O)O 1 or C1=C2C(=CC(=C1Cl)S(=O)(=O)N)S(=O)(=O)N=CN2 1.
Rule 3: Molecules with a nitro group attached to them may be more likely to cause skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to compounds with the SMILES string CNCC(C1=CC(=C(C=C1)O)O)O 1 or C1CC(N(C1)C(=O)C2CSSCC(C(=O)NC(C(=O)NC(C(=O)NC(C(=O)NC

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, nitro, carbonyl, and halogen groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Rule 2: A compound containing conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings may also have higher chances of causing adverse effects due to their ability to absorb UV radiation from sunlight.
Rule 3: Compounds having polar functional groups like hydroxyl, amino, and carboxyl groups tend to be more water-soluble and less likely to penetrate through the lipid bilayer of cell membranes compared to nonpolar compounds. Therefore, they may have lower risks of causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, nitro, or carbonyl groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Explanation: These functional groups can interact with proteins and enzymes in the body, leading to irritation or inflammation of the skin.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues due to their ability to absorb UV light and generate free radicals.
Explanation: Exposure to sunlight or artificial sources of UV radiation can exacerbate any pre-existing skin conditions caused by these compounds.
Rule 3: Compounds with high molecular weight or complex structures may be less likely to penetrate the skin and cause adverse effects compared to simpler molecules. However, they may still pose a risk if they are present in high concentrations or under certain environmental conditions.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a functional group such as -COOH or -SO3H in the molecular structure, then it may lead to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. The presence of these groups increases the polarity of the molecule which allows it to interact more easily with water molecules present on the surface of the skin causing irritation or inflammation.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains aromatic rings, then it may also contribute to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders due to their lipophilic nature. These rings allow the molecule to penetrate deeper into the skin layers where they can irritate or damage cells.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure has a high degree of flexibility, then it may be able to adapt to different conformations allowing it to better fit into biological systems including the skin. This flexibility can increase the likelihood of interactions between the molecule and other components leading to adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) in the structure may indicate potential skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders as a side effect. This rule applies to the first SMILES string provided.
Rule 2: If there is a fluorine atom present on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group in the second SMILES string, it may increase the likelihood of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders as a side effect. However, this rule needs further validation through experimentation or clinical trials.
Rule 3: A sulfhydryl group (-SH) attached to a peptide bond in the fourth SMILES string may suggest potential skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders as a side effect. However, this rule also requires experimental verification.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of sulfonamide group in a compound may increase its potential to cause skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to compounds with SMILES strings starting with "S(=O)(=O)O" or "SO2". For example, the first compound listed has a sulfonamide group and is labeled as having a side-effect activity related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 2: Compounds containing a nitro group (-NO2) may have a higher likelihood of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders if they also contain other functional groups such as aromatic rings or halogens. This rule applies to compounds with SMILES strings containing "NO2" along with other groups such as "C1=CC=CC=C1" or "Cl". For instance, the fifth compound listed contains both a nitro group and an aromatic ring, and is labeled as having a side-effect activity related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 3: Compounds containing conjugated double bonds or carbonyl groups may have a lower risk of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders compared to those without these functionalities. This rule applies to compounds with SMILES strings containing "C=C" or "C=O". For example, the last two compounds listed do not contain any sulfonamide or nitro groups but still have no reported side effects related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 6

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carboxylic acid or its derivatives, amides, esters, and sulfoxides in a compound may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Explanation: These functional groups have the potential to irritate the skin and mucous membranes due to their acidic or basic nature, which can lead to inflammation and other adverse reactions.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also be associated with increased risk of skin irritation and other adverse effects.
Explanation: These structural features can enhance the reactivity of the compound, making it more likely to interact with biological molecules and disrupt normal cellular processes.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and lipophilicity of a compound may also play a role in determining its ability to penetrate the skin and cause adverse effects. Compounds with higher molecular weights and lower octanol-water partition coefficients tend to be less lipophilic and may be less likely to penetrate the skin and cause adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. For example, the presence of sulfonamide or nitro groups in a molecule may increase its potential for skin irritation or allergic reactions.
Rule 2: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a molecule may also play a role in determining its ability to penetrate the skin and cause adverse effects. Molecules with higher molecular weights and greater hydrophobicity may be more likely to accumulate in the skin and cause irritation or other adverse effects.
Rule 3: The shape and size of a molecule may also affect its ability to interact with biological systems and cause adverse effects. For example, molecules with linear shapes may be easier to penetrate the skin than those with more complex structures. Additionally, larger molecules may have difficulty penetrating the skin and reaching their target sites within the body.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a nitro group (-NO2) present in the structure of the molecule, then it may cause adverse effects on the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The presence of this functional group increases the polarity of the molecule which makes it more reactive towards biological systems leading to toxic effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may also cause adverse effects on the skin and subcutaneous tissues. This functional group is known for its antimicrobial property but at higher concentrations, it can lead to allergic reactions or irritation.
Rule 3: If the molecule has a benzene ring attached to it through a carbonyl group (-CO-), then it may have potential adverse effects on the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Benzene rings are known to be carcinogenic and can cause skin irritation when exposed to sunlight.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. This rule applies to compounds C16, C78, C80, C81, C82, C83, C84, C85, C86, C87, C88, C89, C90, C91, C92, C93, C94, C95, C96, C97, C98, C99, and C100.
Rule 2: If a compound has a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom in its structure, then it may also have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. This rule applies to compounds C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C13, C14, C15, C16, C17, C18, C19, C20, C21, C22, C23, C24, C25, C26, C27, C28, C29, C30, C31, C32, C33, C34, C35, C36, C37, C38, C39, C40, C41, C42, C43, C44, C45, C46, C47, C48, C49, C50, C51, C52, C53, C54, C55, C56, C57, C58, C59, C60, C61, C62, C63, C64, C65, C66, C67, C68, C69, C70, C71, C72, C73, C74, C75, C76, C77, C78, C79, C80, C81, C82, C83, C84, C85, C86, C87, C88, C89, C90, C91, C92, C93, C94, C95, C96, C97, C98, C99, and C100.
Rule 3: If a compound has a carbonyl group (-C=O) adjacent to a double bond, then it may also have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. This rule applies to compounds C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C13, C14, C15, C16, C17, C18, C19, C20, C21, C22, C23, C24, C25, C26, C27, C28, C29, C30, C31, C32

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. The presence of these functional groups indicates that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in cellular processes such as inflammation, which can lead to adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) attached to a carbon atom, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Halogen atoms can alter the chemical properties of molecules and affect their interactions with other molecules, including those involved in cellular processes.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen-containing ring structure, such as a pyridine or pyrimidine ring, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Nitrogen-containing rings are commonly found in drugs and other chemicals that interact with biological systems, and they can play important roles in modulating protein-ligand interactions. However, it's worth noting that these rules are based on limited information and should be used cautiously when predicting the potential toxicity of new compounds.
