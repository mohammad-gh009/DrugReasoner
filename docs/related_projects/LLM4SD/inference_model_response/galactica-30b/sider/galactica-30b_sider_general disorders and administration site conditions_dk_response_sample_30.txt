Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Explanation: Sulfonamides and nitro compounds are known to have antimicrobial properties but they also have the potential to cause adverse reactions in some individuals. These groups can interfere with the body's normal functioning by inhibiting certain enzymes involved in metabolic processes. Therefore, if a compound contains these functional groups, it may be more likely to cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and hypersensitivity reactions.
Rule 2: If a compound has a polar surface area greater than 70 Å^2, then it may have side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Explanation: Polar surface area is a measure of how much a compound interacts with water molecules. Compounds with high polar surface areas tend to be more soluble in water and can easily penetrate cell membranes, which can lead to toxicity and other adverse effects. Therefore, if a compound has a polar surface area greater than 70 Å^2, it may be more likely to cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and liver damage.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Explanation: Halogen atoms are known to increase the potency of drugs due to their electron-withdrawing properties. However, they can also increase the reactivity of the compound, leading to increased toxicity and other adverse effects. Therefore, if a compound contains a halogen atom attached to an aromatic ring, it may be more likely to cause side effects such as skin irritation, headache, dizziness, and fatigue.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in general disorders and administration site conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the provided dataset. For example, the first molecule in the list contains both a sulfonamide group and a nitro group, which suggests that it may have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects in general disorders and administration site conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 0 in the provided dataset. For example, the fourth molecule in the list contains such a functional group combination, which suggests that it does not have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen-containing ring system, such as a pyridine or pyrimidine ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in general disorders and administration site conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as either 1 or 0 in the provided dataset. For example, the twelfth molecule in the list contains a pyridine ring, which suggests that

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide or nitro group in the structure of a molecule, then it may lead to adverse effects on the human body. For example, in SMILES string number 1, the presence of the sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) may cause allergic reactions or other health issues.
Rule 2: If the molecular weight of a compound is high, it may indicate that the compound has a larger size and more complex structure, which could potentially increase its toxicity. For instance, in SMILES string number 10, the molecular weight of the compound is 557 g/mol, which is relatively high compared to most organic compounds. This suggests that this particular compound may have some toxic effects on the human body.
Rule 3: The presence of certain atoms or bonds in a molecule may also affect its potential for causing adverse effects. For example, in SMILES string number 12, the presence of the cyano group (-CN) may make the compound highly reactive and potentially harmful to the human body. Therefore, it is important to consider the chemical composition and structure of a molecule when predicting its potential toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like "-COOH" or "-OH" in the structure of a molecule, then it has high probability of causing adverse effects due to its ability to bind to proteins and disrupt their function. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be labeled as 1.
Example: The first SMILES string contains the "-COOH" group which makes it more likely to have adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may cause adverse effects such as methemoglobinemia, hemolytic anemia, and cyanosis. Hence, molecules containing this group should also be labeled as 1.
Example: The second SMILES string contains the "-NO2" group which increases the likelihood of having adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a heterocyclic ring system, especially those containing nitrogen atoms, it may cause adverse effects by binding to receptors and disrupting their normal functioning. For example, the third SMILES string contains a pyrimidine ring which may lead to adverse effects if present in a drug molecule.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring or any other aromatic system, then it may have potential side effects on the human body. This rule applies to molecules such as C1=CC=C(C=C1)N2C=C(C=C(C2=O)C3=CC=CC=C3C#N)C4=CC=CC=N4 1, CC1=CC2C(CCC3(C2CCC3(C(=O)C)OC(=O)C)C)C4(C1=CC(=O)CC4)C 1, C1CCC(CC1)(C2=CC=CC=C2)N3CCCCC3 1, CCC(=O)OCC(=O)[C@]1([C@H](C[C@@H]2[C@@]1(C[C@@H]([C@]3([C@H]2CCC4=CC(=O)C=C[C@@]43C)F)O)C)C)OC(=O)CC 1, CN1CCN2C(C1)C3=CC=CC=C3CC4=CC=CC=C42 1, C1=CC=C(C=C1)NS(=O)(=O)C2=CC=

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, nitro, and halogen groups in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to toxicity.
Rule 2: A molecule containing multiple rings or fused ring systems may also increase its potential for causing adverse effects due to increased steric hindrance and reduced flexibility.
Explanation: This can make it difficult for the molecule to fit into its target binding sites and interact effectively, leading to decreased potency and increased toxicity.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure may also play a role in determining its potential for causing adverse effects. Longer chains and more complex structures may be harder for the body to process and eliminate, leading to accumulation and toxicity.
Explanation: This can lead to increased exposure time and interaction with biological targets, increasing the likelihood of adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as nitro groups or halogen groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects.
Explanation: These functional groups can alter the chemical structure and reactivity of the compound, which could lead to interactions with biological molecules and disrupt normal cellular processes.
Example: The first SMILES string contains two chlorine atoms, which could potentially contribute to adverse effects.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects due to their planar structure and ability to interact with biological molecules through π-π stacking interactions.
Explanation: Aromatic rings are commonly found in drugs and other biologically active compounds, and they can play important roles in binding to target proteins. However, these interactions can also be disruptive if the ring system is too large or too hydrophobic, leading to off-target effects or toxicity.
Example: The second SMILES string contains an aromatic ring with a nitrogen atom, which could potentially contribute to adverse effects.
Rule 3: Compounds with high molecular weight or complex structures may have a greater risk of causing adverse effects due to their increased hydrophobicity and potential for interacting with multiple targets within the body.
Explanation: High molecular weight and complexity can make it more difficult for the compound to cross cell membranes and reach its intended target, but it can also increase its potential for non-specific interactions with other biomolecules.
Example: The third SMILES string has a relatively high molecular weight and includes several fused rings, which could contribute to adverse effects.

================================



================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide, nitro, and carboxylic acid may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects in a molecule. These groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions.
Rule 2: A molecule containing multiple rings or aromatic systems may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects due to their ability to bind strongly to proteins and enzymes.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound can affect its absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profile. Molecules with high molecular weights and hydrophobicities tend to be less soluble and more likely to accumulate in tissues, leading to potential toxic effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) or sulfonyl group (SO2R) in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. This rule can be applied to molecules with SMILES strings starting with C(CCC(=O)O)CCN, CCC(CO)NCCNC(CC)CO, CC1=CC(=NO1)NS(=O)(=O)C2=CC=C(C=C2)N, CO[C@@H]1[C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](O[C@@H]1C(=O)[O-])O[C@H]2[C@@H](O[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]2[O-])NOS(=O)(=O)O)OC)COS(=O)(=O)O)OS(=O)(=O)O)O, CN1C(=O)CN=C(C2=C1C=CC(=C2)Cl)C3=CC=CC=C3, CNC[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](CO)O)O)O)O, CCNC[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](CO)O)O)O)O, C1=CC=C(C=C1)COCC(C(=O)[O-])N(CCN(CCN(CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-], CCSCCC1=NC(=C(N1CC2=CC=C(C=C2)C3=CC=CC=C3C4=NNN=N4)CO)Cl, CS(=O)(=O)C1CC2=CC(=O)CCC2(C3C1C4CCC5(C4(CC3)C)CCC(=O)O5)C, NC2=C(N1CCC(CO)CO)NC(=NC2=O)N, O[C@@H]1[C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](O[C@@H]1C(=O)[O-])O[C@H]2[C@@H](O[C@

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a functional group such as "Cl" or "Br" in the structure of the molecule, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects under general disorders and administration site conditions. This rule can be applied to molecules #1, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25, #26, #27, #28, #29, #30, #31, #32, #33, #34, #35, #36, #37, #38, #39, #40, #41, #42, #43, #44, #45, #46, #47, #48, #49, #50, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #57, #58, #59, #60, #61, #62, #63, #64, #65,

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a sulfonamide group in this molecule suggests potential toxicity. Therefore, molecules containing such groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.
Rule 2: The length and complexity of a molecule may also affect its ability to cause adverse effects. Longer and more complex molecules may have greater flexibility and freedom to interact with biological systems, which could lead to unintended consequences. Therefore, simpler molecules may be safer options when designing new drugs.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule may play a role in determining its potency and efficacy. Different isomers of a molecule may have different physical and chemical properties, which could impact their interactions with target receptors or enzymes. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the stereochemical configuration of a molecule during drug development.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), it may have potential side effects on the human body. This rule applies to molecules labeled as "1" in the given dataset. For example, the first molecule has a sulfonamide group and the fifth molecule has a nitro group. Both of these groups are known to be associated with various side effects such as skin rashes, nausea, and diarrhea.
Rule 2: If a compound contains multiple aromatic rings connected by single bonds, it may also have potential side effects on the human body. This rule applies to molecules labeled as "1" in the given dataset. For instance, the third molecule has two benzene rings connected by a single bond, which makes it more likely to exhibit toxicity than other compounds without this structural feature.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) attached to an unsaturated carbon chain, it may have potential side effects on the human body. This rule applies to molecules labeled as "1" in the given dataset. For example, the eighth molecule has a chlorine atom attached to a double bond, which increases its reactivity and makes it more susceptible to degradation or metabolism.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) or amide group (CONH) in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. This is because these functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions.
Rule 2: A molecule containing aromatic rings may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects due to their ability to form π-π interactions with other molecules. These interactions can alter the structure and function of proteins and nucleic acids.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure may also affect its potential for causing adverse effects. Longer and more complex structures may be harder to metabolize and eliminate from the body, leading to accumulation and toxicity. Additionally, certain stereochemical configurations may enhance or reduce the molecule's potency.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide, nitro group or halogenated aromatic rings in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects. These groups can interact with biological molecules leading to toxicity. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.
Rule 2: Compounds with high lipophilicity tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues like the liver and brain, which can lead to organ damage and other adverse effects. Therefore, compounds with low logP values may have lower risk of causing adverse effects compared to those with higher logP values.
Rule 3: The size and shape of a compound can also affect its ability to cross cell membranes and reach target sites within the body. Large and complex structures may have difficulty penetrating cells, while smaller and more compact ones may have easier access to intracellular targets. Therefore, compounds with larger molecular weights or more complex structures may require closer monitoring for potential toxic effects.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a nitrile group (-CN), then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in humans. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings C1CNN(c2ccccc2)C1 and CCCn1ccnc1.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (-C=O) through a single bond, then it may have a higher chance of causing adverse effects than other types of compounds. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings c1ccc(Oc2ccccc2)cc1 and CC(C)(C#C[C@H]1[C@H](C(=O)[C@@H]([C@H]1O)O)O)O.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a conjugated system consisting of alternating double bonds and single bonds, then it may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings CN(C)Cc1nncn1C1CC1 and COc1ccc(Sc2ccc(S(=O)(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc2)cc1.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Explanation: Sulfonamides and nitro compounds are known to have antimicrobial properties and are commonly used in medicine as antibiotics. However, they can also cause adverse reactions such as skin rashes, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These side effects are likely due to their ability to interfere with the body's normal metabolism and immune system function. Therefore, molecules containing these functional groups should be carefully evaluated for potential side effects before being administered to patients.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Explanation: Aromatic carboxylic acids such as benzoic acid and salicylic acid are common components of many drugs and cosmetics. They can cause irritation and inflammation of the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract if ingested or inhaled. Additionally, some studies suggest that long-term exposure to certain aromatic carboxylic acids may increase the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should be used cautiously and only under the supervision of a healthcare professional.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a guanidine group (-C(=NH)NH2), then it may have side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Explanation: Guanidines are organic compounds that have a wide range of biological activities, including antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. However, they can also

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Explanation: Sulfonamides and nitro compounds are known to have antimicrobial properties but they also have the potential to cause adverse reactions in some individuals. These groups can interfere with the body's normal functioning by inhibiting certain enzymes involved in metabolic processes. Therefore, if a compound contains these functional groups, it may be more likely to cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and hypersensitivity reactions.
Rule 2: If a compound has a polar surface area greater than 70 Å^2, then it may have side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Explanation: Polar surface area is a measure of how much a compound interacts with water molecules. Compounds with high polar surface areas tend to be more soluble in water and can easily penetrate cell membranes, which can lead to toxicity and other adverse effects. Therefore, if a compound has a polar surface area greater than 70 Å^2, it may be more likely to cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and liver damage.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Explanation: Halogen atoms are known to increase the potency of drugs due to their electron-withdrawing properties. However, they can also increase the reactivity of the compound, leading to increased toxicity and other adverse effects. Therefore, if a compound contains a halogen atom attached to an aromatic ring, it may be more likely to cause side effects such as skin irritation, headache, dizziness, and fatigue.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as halogen atoms or nitro groups in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1. For example, the molecule represented by the SMILES string CNC(=O)C1=NC=CC(=C1)OC2=CC=C(C=C2)NC(=O)NC3=CC(=C(C=C3)Cl)C(F)(F)F contains chlorine and fluorine atoms which may contribute to its side-effect activity.
Rule 2: The molecular weight of a molecule may also play a role in determining its potential for causing adverse effects. Molecules with higher molecular weights may have greater potential for toxicity due to their larger size and increased ability to interact with biological systems. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as either 0 or 1. For example, the molecule represented by the SMILES string C1CC(C2=CC=CC=C2C1)C3=NCCN3 has a relatively high molecular weight compared to other molecules in the dataset and may therefore have a higher risk of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: The structure of a molecule may affect its potential for causing adverse effects through its ability to bind to specific receptors or enzymes within the body. This rule can only be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 since they exhibit known side-effect activities. For example, the molecule represented by the SMILES string O[Fe]=O.O[Fe]=O.[Fe] contains iron atoms which may allow it to bind to certain enzymes or receptors involved in cellular processes.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a chlorine atom present in the structure, then it may cause adverse effects. The presence of halogen atoms like fluorine or bromine has been known to increase the lipophilicity of molecules which can lead to increased toxicity. However, this rule should be applied cautiously as other factors such as the position of the halogen atom and its electronic properties also play a role in determining its toxicity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may cause adverse effects. Nitro groups are highly reactive and can interact with biological molecules leading to toxic effects. They have been associated with various types of toxicities including carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and neurotoxicity.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may cause adverse effects. Sulfonamides are antibiotics that inhibit bacterial growth by blocking the production of folic acid. However, they can also cause allergic reactions, skin rashes, and other adverse effects in some individuals.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a nitro group (-NO2) in the structure of a molecule, then it may cause adverse effects such as general disorders and administration site conditions. The presence of this functional group increases the polarity of the molecule, which can lead to increased reactivity and toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may also cause adverse effects such as general disorders and administration site conditions. This functional group is known for its antimicrobial properties but can also be toxic at high doses.
Rule 3: If a molecule has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to a benzene ring, then it may cause skin irritation or sensitization reactions. This functional group can react with proteins in the skin, leading to inflammation and other allergic responses.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in general disorders and administration site conditions. The presence of these functional groups may increase the reactivity of the molecule and lead to toxic reactions.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), or iodine (I), then it also has a high probability of causing adverse effects in general disorders and administration site conditions. Halogen atoms can increase the lipophilicity of the molecule, which can enhance its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a heterocyclic ring system such as pyridine (-C5H4N), pyrimidine (-C4H4N2), or pyrazine (-C4H4N2), then it has a moderate probability of causing adverse effects in general disorders and administration site conditions. Heterocyclic rings can increase the chemical diversity of the molecule and provide opportunities for interactions with biological targets. However, their presence may also increase the toxicity of the molecule due to their potential to form reactive metabolites.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a carbonyl group (C=O) in addition to other functional groups such as halogen atoms, nitro groups, or amines, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25, #26, #27, #28, #29, #30, #31, #32, #33, #34, #35, #36, #37, #38, #39, #40, #41, #42, #43, #44, #45, #46, #47, #48, #49, #50, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #57, #58, #59, #60, #61, #62,

================================

Rule 1: The presence of bromine in the molecular structure may indicate potential side effects such as general disorders and administration site conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with CC[N+](C)(C)CC1=CC=CC=C1Br.
Rule 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecular structure may also suggest potential side effects such as general disorders and administration site conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with C1=CN(C=N1)CC(O)(P(=O)(O)O)P(=O)(O)O.
Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in the molecular structure may indicate potential side effects such as general disorders and administration site conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with CCCOC(=O)C(CCC1=CC=CC=C1)NC(C)C(=O)N2C3CCCCC3CC2C(=O)O or C1CCC(C(C1)[NH-])[NH-].C(=O)(C(=O)O)O.[Pt+2].

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains two or more benzene rings connected by single bonds, it may have adverse effects on the human body. This rule applies to the second SMILES string in the dataset where there are multiple benzene rings present.
Rule 2: If a compound has a functional group such as carbonyl (C=O), it may cause adverse effects if it is part of a larger ring structure like in the third SMILES string. The presence of this functional group makes the compound more reactive which can lead to toxicity.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a sulfhydryl (SH) group, it may also cause adverse effects due to its ability to bind to proteins and disrupt their function. This rule applies to the fourth SMILES string where there is a sulfhydryl group present.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) or sulfonyl group (SO2R) in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. This rule can be applied to molecules with SMILES strings starting with C(CCC(=O)O)CCN, CCC(CO)NCCNC(CC)CO, CC1=CC(=NO1)NS(=O)(=O)C2=CC=C(C=C2)N, CO[C@@H]1[C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](O[C@@H]1C(=O)[O-])O[C@H]2[C@@H](O[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]2[O-])NOS(=O)(=O)O)OC)COS(=O)(=O)O)OS(=O)(=O)O)O, CN1C(=O)CN=C(C2=C1C=CC(=C2)Cl)C3=CC=CC=C3, CNC[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](CO)O)O)O)O, CCNC[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](CO)O)O)O)O, C1=CC=C(C=C1)COCC(C(=O)[O-])N(CCN(CCN(CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-], CCSCCC1=NC(=C(N1CC2=CC=C(C=C2)C3=CC=CC=C3C4=NNN=N4)CO)Cl, CS(=O)(=O)C1CC2=CC(=O)CCC2(C3C1C4CCC5(C4(CC3)C)CCC(=O)O5)C, NC2=C(N1CCC(CO)CO)NC(=NC2=O)N, O[C@@H]1[C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](O[C@@H]1C(=O)[O-])O[C@H]2[C@@H](O[C@

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of functional groups such as nitro group or sulfonamide in the structure of the molecule, then it may lead to adverse effects. For example, in the first SMILES string, the presence of the nitro group (-NO2) may cause adverse effects on the central nervous system.
Rule 2: If the molecular weight of the compound is greater than 500 Daltons, then it may have higher chances of causing adverse effects. For instance, in the fifth SMILES string, the molecular weight of the compound is 903 Da which makes it more likely to cause adverse effects compared to other compounds in the dataset.
Rule 3: The presence of multiple rings in the structure of the molecule may also increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, in the tenth SMILES string, the compound has two benzene rings which make it more prone to interact with biological systems and potentially cause adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a sulfonamide group in this molecule suggests potential toxicity. Therefore, molecules containing such groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.
Rule 2: The length and complexity of a molecule may also affect its ability to cause adverse effects. Longer and more complex molecules may have greater flexibility and freedom to interact with biological systems, which could lead to unintended consequences. Therefore, simpler molecules may be safer options when designing new drugs.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule may play a role in determining its potency and efficacy. Different isomers of a molecule may have different physical and chemical properties, which could impact their interactions with target receptors or enzymes. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the stereochemical configuration of a molecule during drug development.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Explanation: Sulfonamides and nitro compounds are known to have antimicrobial properties but they also have the potential to cause adverse reactions in some individuals. These groups can interfere with the body's normal functioning by inhibiting certain enzymes involved in metabolic processes. Therefore, if a compound contains these functional groups, it may be more likely to cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and hypersensitivity reactions.
Rule 2: If a compound has a polar surface area greater than 70 Å^2, then it may have side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Explanation: Polar surface area is a measure of how much a compound interacts with water molecules. Compounds with high polar surface areas tend to be more soluble in water and can easily penetrate cell membranes, which can lead to toxicity and other adverse effects. Therefore, if a compound has a polar surface area greater than 70 Å^2, it may be more likely to cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and liver damage.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Explanation: Halogen atoms are known to increase the potency of drugs due to their electron-withdrawing properties. However, they can also increase the reactivity of the compound, leading to increased toxicity and other adverse effects. Therefore, if a compound contains a halogen atom attached to an aromatic ring, it may be more likely to cause side effects such as skin irritation, headache, dizziness, and fatigue.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a functional group such as "-COOH" or "-OH" in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds with other molecules in the body.
Example: The first SMILES string contains the functional group "-COOH" which may cause adverse effects if administered orally.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains multiple rings or aromatic systems, it may also lead to adverse effects due to their ability to interact with biological receptors.
Example: The second SMILES string contains two fused benzene rings which may cause adverse effects if ingested.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a charged atom such as sodium or strontium, it may also lead to adverse effects due to its ability to disrupt ionic balance within cells.
Example: The third SMILES string contains a positively charged strontium ion which may cause adverse effects if taken internally.
