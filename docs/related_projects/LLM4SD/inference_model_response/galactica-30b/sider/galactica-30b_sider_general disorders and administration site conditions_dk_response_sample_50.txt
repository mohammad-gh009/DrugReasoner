Rule 1: If there exists a functional group such as "-COOH" or "-OH" in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds with other molecules in the body.
Example: The first SMILES string contains the functional group "-COOH" which may cause adverse effects if administered orally.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains multiple rings or aromatic systems, it may also lead to adverse effects due to their ability to interact with biological receptors.
Example: The second SMILES string contains two fused benzene rings which may cause adverse effects if ingested.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a charged atom such as sodium or strontium, it may also lead to adverse effects due to its ability to disrupt ionic balance within cells.
Example: The third SMILES string contains a positively charged strontium ion which may cause adverse effects if taken internally.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide, nitro group or halogenated aromatic rings in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects. These groups can interact with biological molecules leading to toxicity. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.
Rule 2: Compounds with high lipophilicity tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues like the liver and brain, which can lead to organ damage and other adverse effects. Therefore, compounds with low logP values may have lower risk of causing adverse effects compared to those with higher logP values.
Rule 3: The size and shape of a compound can also affect its ability to cross cell membranes and reach target sites within the body. Large and complex structures may have difficulty penetrating cells, while smaller and more compact ones may have easier access to intracellular targets. Therefore, compounds with larger molecular weights or more complex structures may require closer monitoring for potential toxic effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) or amide group (CONH) in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. This is because these functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions.
Rule 2: A molecule containing aromatic rings may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects due to their ability to form π-π interactions with other molecules. These interactions can alter the structure and function of proteins and nucleic acids.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure may also affect its potential for causing adverse effects. Longer and more complex structures may be harder to metabolize and eliminate from the body, leading to accumulation and toxicity. Additionally, certain stereochemical configurations may enhance or reduce the molecule's potency.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in general disorders and administration site conditions. The presence of these functional groups may increase the reactivity of the molecule and lead to toxic reactions.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), or iodine (I), then it also has a high probability of causing adverse effects in general disorders and administration site conditions. Halogen atoms can increase the lipophilicity of the molecule, which can enhance its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a heterocyclic ring system such as pyridine (-C5H4N), pyrimidine (-C4H4N2), or pyrazine (-C4H4N2), then it has a moderate probability of causing adverse effects in general disorders and administration site conditions. Heterocyclic rings can increase the chemical diversity of the molecule and provide opportunities for interactions with biological targets. However, their presence may also increase the toxicity of the molecule due to their potential to form reactive metabolites.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carboxyl, or nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects. This rule can be applied by analyzing the chemical structure of the compound and identifying any such functional groups.
Rule 2: A compound containing multiple aromatic rings may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects than one with only one ring. This rule can also be applied by analyzing the chemical structure of the compound.
Rule 3: A compound with a molecular weight greater than 500 Daltons may have a lower likelihood of being absorbed into the body and therefore may have a reduced potential for causing adverse effects. However, this rule should be used cautiously since other factors such as solubility and lipophilicity can also affect absorption.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as sulfonamide or nitro group, it may lead to adverse effects in the body. The presence of these groups increases the chances of interaction between the drug molecules and biological systems leading to toxicity. Therefore, drugs containing these groups should be used cautiously.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains multiple rings or fused ring systems, it may increase the lipophilicity of the compound resulting in increased absorption into the bloodstream. However, this also increases the risk of accumulation in tissues causing adverse reactions. Hence, drugs containing complex structures should be used carefully.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains polar functional groups such as hydroxyl, amino, or carboxyl groups, it may decrease the permeability across cell membranes due to their hydrophilic nature. This reduces the bioavailability of the drug and increases the likelihood of adverse effects. Therefore, drugs containing these groups should be administered at lower doses or avoided altogether.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a chlorine atom present in the structure, then it may cause adverse effects. The presence of halogen atoms like fluorine or bromine has been known to increase the lipophilicity of molecules which can lead to increased toxicity. However, this rule should be applied cautiously as other factors such as the position of the halogen atom and its electronic properties also play a role in determining its toxicity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may cause adverse effects. Nitro groups are highly reactive and can interact with biological molecules leading to toxic effects. They have been associated with various types of toxicities including carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and neurotoxicity.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may cause adverse effects. Sulfonamides are antibiotics that inhibit bacterial growth by blocking the production of folic acid. However, they can also cause allergic reactions, skin rashes, and other adverse effects in some individuals.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in general disorders and administration site conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the provided dataset. For example, the first molecule in the list contains both a sulfonamide group and a nitro group, which suggests that it may have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects in general disorders and administration site conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 0 in the provided dataset. For example, the fourth molecule in the list contains such a functional group combination, which suggests that it does not have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen-containing ring system, such as a pyridine or pyrimidine ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in general disorders and administration site conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as either 1 or 0 in the provided dataset. For example, the twelfth molecule in the list contains a pyridine ring, which suggests that

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of any functional group such as carbonyl or carboxylic acid in the structure of the molecule, then it may lead to adverse effects on the body. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1. For example, in the first SMILES string, the molecule contains a carbonyl group which may cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule has a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may also lead to adverse effects if it is part of a ring structure. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1. For example, in the second SMILES string, the molecule contains a nitrogen atom connected to a carbon atom in a ring structure which may cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine, then it may increase its ability to cross cell membranes and potentially cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1. For example, in the sixth SMILES string, the molecule contains two chlorine atoms which may make it more likely to cause adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide, nitro, and carboxylic acid may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects in a molecule. These groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions.
Rule 2: A molecule containing multiple rings or aromatic systems may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects due to their ability to bind strongly to proteins and enzymes.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound can affect its absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profile. Molecules with high molecular weights and hydrophobicities tend to be less soluble and more likely to accumulate in tissues, leading to potential toxic effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects associated with general disorders and administration site conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the provided dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a quinazoline ring system, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects associated with skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the provided dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzimidazole ring system, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects associated with gastrointestinal tract and liver disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the provided dataset.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) or carboxyl group (COOH) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects. This rule applies to compounds 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in a molecule has been linked to increased toxicity. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be given more attention when evaluating their potential for adverse effects.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule can also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects. Molecules that are too large or have a non-optimal shape may not be able to penetrate cell membranes easily, which could reduce their bioavailability and potentially decrease their ability to cause adverse effects. On the other hand, smaller molecules may be easier to absorb but may also be more likely to cross the blood-brain barrier and affect the central nervous system. Therefore, the optimal size and shape of a molecule for causing adverse effects may depend on the specific target organ or tissue being affected.
Rule 3: The presence of certain substructures within a molecule may indicate a higher risk of adverse effects. For example, the presence of a benzene ring or a heterocyclic ring in a molecule may increase its hydrophobicity and make it more likely to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues such as the liver or brain. This can lead to toxic effects such as hepatotoxicity or neurotoxicity. Additionally, the presence of multiple polar functional groups in a molecule may increase its water solubility and make it more likely to interact with proteins or enzymes, leading to off-target effects or disruption of normal cellular processes.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a nitro group (-NO2) in the structure of a molecule, then it may cause adverse effects such as general disorders and administration site conditions. The presence of this functional group increases the polarity of the molecule, which can lead to increased reactivity and toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may also cause adverse effects such as general disorders and administration site conditions. This functional group is known for its antimicrobial properties but can also be toxic at high doses.
Rule 3: If a molecule has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to a benzene ring, then it may cause skin irritation or sensitization reactions. This functional group can react with proteins in the skin, leading to inflammation and other allergic responses.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) or sulfonyl group (SO2R) in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. This rule can be applied to molecules with SMILES strings starting with C(CCC(=O)O)CCN, CCC(CO)NCCNC(CC)CO, CC1=CC(=NO1)NS(=O)(=O)C2=CC=C(C=C2)N, CO[C@@H]1[C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](O[C@@H]1C(=O)[O-])O[C@H]2[C@@H](O[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]2[O-])NOS(=O)(=O)O)OC)COS(=O)(=O)O)OS(=O)(=O)O)O, CN1C(=O)CN=C(C2=C1C=CC(=C2)Cl)C3=CC=CC=C3, CNC[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](CO)O)O)O)O, CCNC[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](CO)O)O)O)O, C1=CC=C(C=C1)COCC(C(=O)[O-])N(CCN(CCN(CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-], CCSCCC1=NC(=C(N1CC2=CC=C(C=C2)C3=CC=CC=C3C4=NNN=N4)CO)Cl, CS(=O)(=O)C1CC2=CC(=O)CCC2(C3C1C4CCC5(C4(CC3)C)CCC(=O)O5)C, NC2=C(N1CCC(CO)CO)NC(=NC2=O)N, O[C@@H]1[C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](O[C@@H]1C(=O)[O-])O[C@H]2[C@@H](O[C@

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a sulfonamide group in this molecule suggests potential toxicity. Therefore, molecules containing such groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.
Rule 2: The length and complexity of a molecule may also affect its ability to cause adverse effects. Longer and more complex molecules may have greater flexibility and freedom to interact with biological systems, which could lead to unintended consequences. Therefore, simpler molecules may be safer options when designing new drugs.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule may play a role in determining its potency and efficacy. Different isomers of a molecule may have different physical and chemical properties, which could impact their interactions with target receptors or enzymes. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the stereochemical configuration of a molecule during drug development.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a functional group such as "Cl" or "Br" in the structure of the molecule, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects under general disorders and administration site conditions. This rule can be applied to molecules #1, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25, #26, #27, #28, #29, #30, #31, #32, #33, #34, #35, #36, #37, #38, #39, #40, #41, #42, #43, #44, #45, #46, #47, #48, #49, #50, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #57, #58, #59, #60, #61, #62, #63, #64, #65, 

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like "-COOH" or "-OH" in the structure of a molecule, then it has high probability of causing adverse effects due to its ability to bind to proteins and disrupt their function. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be labeled as 1.
Example: The first SMILES string contains the "-COOH" group which makes it more likely to have adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may cause adverse effects such as methemoglobinemia, hemolytic anemia, and cyanosis. Hence, molecules containing this group should also be labeled as 1.
Example: The second SMILES string contains the "-NO2" group which increases the likelihood of having adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a heterocyclic ring system, especially those containing nitrogen atoms, it may cause adverse effects by binding to receptors and disrupting their normal functioning. For example, the third SMILES string contains a pyrimidine ring which may lead to adverse effects if present in a drug molecule.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as carbonyl or carboxyl groups, it may lead to adverse effects in the body. This rule applies to molecules labeled with "1" in the dataset. For example, in the first molecule, the presence of two carbonyl groups (C=O) may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a nitrogen atom bonded to other atoms such as carbon and hydrogen, it may also contribute to potential adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules labeled with "1" in the dataset. For instance, in the second molecule, the presence of a nitrogen atom (N) may affect the central nervous system by altering neurotransmitter levels.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring or other aromatic rings, it may enhance the ability of the molecule to cross the blood-brain barrier and potentially cause adverse effects on the brain. This rule applies to molecules labeled with "1" in the dataset. For example, in the third molecule, the presence of a phenyl group (C6H5) may increase the risk of neurological toxicity due to its lipophilic nature.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like carbonyl or carboxylic acid in the structure of the molecule, then it may have potential for causing adverse effects on the body. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)C2=C(C(=CC=C2)CC(=O)N)N, CCOC(=O)O[C@@]1(CCC2[C@@]1(C[C@@H](C3C2CCC4=CC(=O)C=C[C@]34C)O)C)C(=O)OCCl, CCC1(C(=O)NCNC1=O)C2=CC=CC=C2, COC(=O)CSCC4C[C@H]5CC[C@@H](C4)N5C, CN1C(NC2=CC(=C(C=C2S1(=O)=O)S(=O)(=O)N)Cl)CCl, CCSOC(=O)C(C)(C)OC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)C2=CC=C(C=C2)Cl, CCC(=O)OCC(=O)C1(CCC2C1(CC(C3C2CCC4=CC(=O)

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional groups such as carboxylic acid or its derivatives in the structure of a molecule, then it may have potential for causing adverse effects on general disorders and administration site conditions. The given SMILES string contains a carboxylic acid group which supports this rule.
Rule 2: If a molecule has a sulfonyl group present in its structure, it may lead to adverse reactions associated with general disorders and administration site conditions. However, the second SMILES string does not contain any sulfonyl group, so it does not support this rule.
Rule 3: A molecule containing a germanium atom in its structure may potentially exhibit toxicity due to its ability to mimic silicon in biological systems. The fourth SMILES string contains a germanium atom, supporting this rule.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a carbonyl group (C=O) in addition to other functional groups such as halogen atoms, nitro groups, or amines, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25, #26, #27, #28, #29, #30, #31, #32, #33, #34, #35, #36, #37, #38, #39, #40, #41, #42, #43, #44, #45, #46, #47, #48, #49, #50, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #57, #58, #59, #60, #61, #62,

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, nitro, and halogen groups in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to toxicity.
Rule 2: A molecule containing multiple rings or fused ring systems may also increase its potential for causing adverse effects due to increased steric hindrance and reduced flexibility.
Explanation: This can make it difficult for the molecule to fit into its target binding sites and interact effectively, leading to decreased potency and increased toxicity.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure may also play a role in determining its potential for causing adverse effects. Longer chains and more complex structures may be harder for the body to process and eliminate, leading to accumulation and toxicity.
Explanation: This can lead to increased exposure time and interaction with biological targets, increasing the likelihood of adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), it may have potential side effects on the human body. This rule applies to molecules labeled as "1" in the given dataset. For example, the first molecule has a sulfonamide group and the fifth molecule has a nitro group. Both of these groups are known to be associated with various side effects such as skin rashes, nausea, and diarrhea.
Rule 2: If a compound contains multiple aromatic rings connected by single bonds, it may also have potential side effects on the human body. This rule applies to molecules labeled as "1" in the given dataset. For instance, the third molecule has two benzene rings connected by a single bond, which makes it more likely to exhibit toxicity than other compounds without this structural feature.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) attached to an unsaturated carbon chain, it may have potential side effects on the human body. This rule applies to molecules labeled as "1" in the given dataset. For example, the eighth molecule has a chlorine atom attached to a double bond, which increases its reactivity and makes it more susceptible to degradation or metabolism.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of iodine atoms in the second molecule suggests that it could have some toxic effects on the body. Similarly, the presence of fluorine atoms in the sixth molecule indicates that it might be harmful if ingested or inhaled.
Rule 2: The structure of a molecule plays a crucial role in determining its potential toxicity. For instance, the third molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond which makes it more reactive than other molecules. This increased reactivity could lead to unwanted interactions with other molecules in the body, potentially resulting in adverse effects.
Rule 3: The size and shape of a molecule can also affect its ability to cause adverse effects. For example, the eleventh molecule has a relatively large size compared to others, which could make it difficult for the body to excrete it effectively. Additionally, the thirteenth molecule has a bent shape which could hinder its ability to interact with biological targets.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of Gd+3 in the molecular structure indicates potential toxicity due to its paramagnetic nature which affects the chemical environment around the molecule causing unwanted interactions within biological systems. Therefore, molecules containing gadolinium should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: The presence of fluorine atoms in the molecular structure may increase lipophilicity leading to increased absorption into cells and tissues resulting in potential toxic effects. Therefore, fluorinated compounds should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.
Rule 3: The presence of negatively charged functional groups such as carboxylate or phosphate groups in the molecular structure increases water solubility making them more likely to interact with proteins and other biomolecules potentially leading to toxic effects. Therefore, these types of structures should be avoided unless necessary.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide or nitro group in the structure of a molecule, then it may lead to adverse effects on the human body. For example, in SMILES string number 1, the presence of the sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) may cause allergic reactions or other health issues.
Rule 2: If the molecular weight of a compound is high, it may indicate that the compound has a larger size and more complex structure, which could potentially increase its toxicity. For instance, in SMILES string number 10, the molecular weight of the compound is 557 g/mol, which is relatively high compared to most organic compounds. This suggests that this particular compound may have some toxic effects on the human body.
Rule 3: The presence of certain atoms or bonds in a molecule may also affect its potential for causing adverse effects. For example, in SMILES string number 12, the presence of the cyano group (-CN) may make the compound highly reactive and potentially harmful to the human body. Therefore, it is important to consider the chemical composition and structure of a molecule when predicting its potential toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have adverse effects on the body.
Explanation: Sulfonamides and nitro compounds are known to have antimicrobial properties but they also have the potential to cause adverse reactions in some individuals. These groups can interfere with the normal functioning of the body's cells by inhibiting certain enzymes involved in metabolic processes.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure has a high degree of hydrophobicity, i.e. it is highly lipophilic, then it may be more likely to cross the cell membrane and interact with intracellular components, leading to adverse effects.
Explanation: Hydrophobicity refers to the ability of a substance to dissolve in nonpolar solvents such as lipids. Highly hydrophobic molecules tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues such as the brain, liver, and adipose tissue, where they can disrupt cellular functions. They can also bind to proteins and other macromolecules, causing structural changes and functional impairments.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains multiple aromatic rings, then it may have adverse effects on the central nervous system.
Explanation: Aromatic rings are planar structures with delocalized pi electrons that make them highly stable and reactive. Compounds containing multiple aromatic rings often have strong binding affinities for receptors in the central nervous system, which can lead to neurological and psychiatric symptoms such as seizures, hallucinations, and depression.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group or carboxylic acid group in the structure of a molecule, then it may have potential to cause adverse effects on general disorders and administration site conditions. The given SMILES strings with labels 1 contain these functional groups which could be responsible for causing those side-effects.
Rule 2: A molecule containing multiple rings or aromatic systems may also exhibit similar side-effects due to their structural complexity. The second SMILES string with label 1 contains two six-membered rings connected by a nitrogen atom, which increases its molecular weight and surface area, making it more likely to interact with biological molecules and cause harm.
Rule 3: The third SMILES string with label 1 has a chlorine atom attached to one end of the carbon chain, which may increase its lipophilicity and facilitate penetration through cell membranes leading to toxic effects. However, this rule cannot be generalized as other factors like dosage, route of administration, and individual susceptibility play important roles in determining the overall toxicity profile of a compound.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure or properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the first molecule in the dataset contains a sulfonamide group and is labeled as "1" because it is known to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the second molecule in the dataset contains a fluorine atom and is labeled as "1" because it is known to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" in the dataset. For example, the last molecule in the dataset contains a nitro group and is labeled as "0" because it is not known to cause any adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects such as general disorders and administration site conditions. The given SMILES string contains one such group which matches this rule.
Rule 2: If there exist any aromatic rings in the molecular structure, then they may also contribute towards causing adverse effects. The second SMILES string contains two benzene rings which match this rule.
Rule 3: If there exists a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) or a carbonyl group (-COR) in the molecular structure, then it may increase the likelihood of adverse effects. However, these groups do not necessarily guarantee adverse effects since other factors such as dosage and individual susceptibility play a role too. None of the given SMILES strings contain either of these groups.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring or any other aromatic system, then it may have potential side effects on the human body. This rule applies to molecules such as C1=CC=C(C=C1)N2C=C(C=C(C2=O)C3=CC=CC=C3C#N)C4=CC=CC=N4 1, CC1=CC2C(CCC3(C2CCC3(C(=O)C)OC(=O)C)C)C4(C1=CC(=O)CC4)C 1, C1CCC(CC1)(C2=CC=CC=C2)N3CCCCC3 1, CCC(=O)OCC(=O)[C@]1([C@H](C[C@@H]2[C@@]1(C[C@@H]([C@]3([C@H]2CCC4=CC(=O)C=C[C@@]43C)F)O)C)C)OC(=O)CC 1, CN1CCN2C(C1)C3=CC=CC=C3CC4=CC=CC=C42 1, C1=CC=C(C=C1)NS(=O)(=O)C2=CC=

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as nitro groups or halogen groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects.
Explanation: These functional groups can alter the chemical structure and reactivity of the compound, which could lead to interactions with biological molecules and disrupt normal cellular processes.
Example: The first SMILES string contains two chlorine atoms, which could potentially contribute to adverse effects.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects due to their planar structure and ability to interact with biological molecules through π-π stacking interactions.
Explanation: Aromatic rings are commonly found in drugs and other biologically active compounds, and they can play important roles in binding to target proteins. However, these interactions can also be disruptive if the ring system is too large or too hydrophobic, leading to off-target effects or toxicity.
Example: The second SMILES string contains an aromatic ring with a nitrogen atom, which could potentially contribute to adverse effects.
Rule 3: Compounds with high molecular weight or complex structures may have a greater risk of causing adverse effects due to their increased hydrophobicity and potential for interacting with multiple targets within the body.
Explanation: High molecular weight and complexity can make it more difficult for the compound to cross cell membranes and reach its intended target, but it can also increase its potential for non-specific interactions with other biomolecules.
Example: The third SMILES string has a relatively high molecular weight and includes several fused rings, which could contribute to adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) in a molecule may indicate potential side effects such as general disorders and administration site conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1. For example, the first molecule contains a cyano group and is associated with these types of side effects.
Rule 2: A carbonyl group (-C=O) adjacent to a nitrogen atom in a molecule may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as either 0 or 1. For instance, the second molecule has this structural feature but does not have any known association with specific side effects. However, since there is no information about the actual side effects caused by this molecule, we cannot make a definitive prediction based on this rule alone.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a five-membered ring with two double bonds and one oxygen atom may be more likely to cause adverse effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1. For example, the third molecule contains this structure and is associated with these types of side effects.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Explanation: Sulfonamides and nitro compounds are known to have antimicrobial properties and are commonly used in medicine as antibiotics. However, they can also cause adverse reactions such as skin rashes, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These side effects are likely due to their ability to interfere with the body's normal metabolism and immune system function. Therefore, molecules containing these functional groups should be carefully evaluated for potential side effects before being administered to patients.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Explanation: Aromatic carboxylic acids such as benzoic acid and salicylic acid are common components of many drugs and cosmetics. They can cause irritation and inflammation of the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract if ingested or inhaled. Additionally, some studies suggest that long-term exposure to certain aromatic carboxylic acids may increase the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should be used cautiously and only under the supervision of a healthcare professional.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a guanidine group (-C(=NH)NH2), then it may have side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Explanation: Guanidines are organic compounds that have a wide range of biological activities, including antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. However, they can also

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a halogen atom in the structure of the molecule, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects. The presence of chlorine or fluorine atoms may increase the reactivity of the molecule, leading to unwanted interactions with other molecules or tissues.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it has a higher chance of causing adverse effects. Nitro groups are known to be highly reactive and can interact with other molecules or tissues, leading to toxic effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it also has a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects. Sulfonyl groups are often used as pharmacophores for drugs due to their ability to bind to specific receptors, but they can also lead to toxicity if they react with other molecules or tissues.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide, nitro group or carboxylic acid may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects. This rule can be applied to molecules with labels 1 in the given dataset. For example, the first molecule contains a sulfonamide group which is known for its potential to cause adverse reactions. Similarly, the third molecule has a nitro group which is also associated with toxicity.
Rule 2: The absence of certain structural features such as aromatic rings or double bonds may decrease the probability of causing adverse effects. This rule can be applied to molecules with labels 0 in the given dataset. For instance, the fourth molecule does not have any aromatic ring or double bond, making it less likely to cause adverse effects compared to other molecules in the dataset.
Rule 3: The charge state of a molecule may affect its ability to interact with biological systems and potentially cause adverse effects. This rule can be applied to molecules with labels 1 in the given dataset where the charge state is explicitly mentioned. For example, the fifth molecule carries a negative charge due to the presence of a carboxylate ion, which may enhance its interaction with biological targets and lead to adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a phosphate group (-OPO3H2), then it may have adverse effects on the body.
Explanation: Sulfonamides and phosphates are known to be toxic and can cause various health problems such as kidney damage, liver failure, and neurological disorders. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxicity before being used in therapy.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have adverse effects on the body.
Explanation: Nitro compounds are highly reactive and can interact with other molecules in the body, leading to cellular damage and tissue injury. They also have the potential to cause methemoglobinemia, which is a condition where the blood does not carry enough oxygen due to the presence of abnormal hemoglobin.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring, then it may have adverse effects on the body.
Explanation: Benzene is a carcinogenic substance that can cause leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. It can also affect the immune system and lead to autoimmune diseases. Therefore, molecules containing this group should be used with caution and only under strict medical supervision.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of sulfonamide group in the structure of a molecule, then it may cause adverse effects such as skin rashes or allergic reactions. The given SMILES string has no sulfonamide group present so it does not meet this rule.
Rule 2: If there is a presence of nitro group in the structure of a molecule, then it may cause adverse effects such as methemoglobinemia or hemolytic anemia. The given SMILES string has no nitro group present so it does not meet this rule.
Rule 3: If there is a presence of carboxylic acid group in the structure of a molecule, then it may cause adverse effects such as irritation or corrosion on the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, throat, and respiratory system. The given SMILES string has no carboxylic acid group present so it does not meet this rule.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as halogen atoms or nitro groups in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1. For example, the molecule represented by the SMILES string CNC(=O)C1=NC=CC(=C1)OC2=CC=C(C=C2)NC(=O)NC3=CC(=C(C=C3)Cl)C(F)(F)F contains chlorine and fluorine atoms which may contribute to its side-effect activity.
Rule 2: The molecular weight of a molecule may also play a role in determining its potential for causing adverse effects. Molecules with higher molecular weights may have greater potential for toxicity due to their larger size and increased ability to interact with biological systems. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as either 0 or 1. For example, the molecule represented by the SMILES string C1CC(C2=CC=CC=C2C1)C3=NCCN3 has a relatively high molecular weight compared to other molecules in the dataset and may therefore have a higher risk of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: The structure of a molecule may affect its potential for causing adverse effects through its ability to bind to specific receptors or enzymes within the body. This rule can only be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 since they exhibit known side-effect activities. For example, the molecule represented by the SMILES string O[Fe]=O.O[Fe]=O.[Fe] contains iron atoms which may allow it to bind to certain enzymes or receptors involved in cellular processes.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a nitrile group (-CN), then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in humans. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings C1CNN(c2ccccc2)C1 and CCCn1ccnc1.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (-C=O) through a single bond, then it may have a higher chance of causing adverse effects than other types of compounds. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings c1ccc(Oc2ccccc2)cc1 and CC(C)(C#C[C@H]1[C@H](C(=O)[C@@H]([C@H]1O)O)O)O.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a conjugated system consisting of alternating double bonds and single bonds, then it may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings CN(C)Cc1nncn1C1CC1 and COc1ccc(Sc2ccc(S(=O)(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc2)cc1.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of functional groups such as nitro group or sulfonamide in the structure of the molecule, then it may lead to adverse effects. For example, in the first SMILES string, the presence of the nitro group (-NO2) may cause adverse effects on the central nervous system.
Rule 2: If the molecular weight of the compound is greater than 500 Daltons, then it may have higher chances of causing adverse effects. For instance, in the fifth SMILES string, the molecular weight of the compound is 903 Da which makes it more likely to cause adverse effects compared to other compounds in the dataset.
Rule 3: The presence of multiple rings in the structure of the molecule may also increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, in the tenth SMILES string, the compound has two benzene rings which make it more prone to interact with biological systems and potentially cause adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects.
Explanation: These functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to toxicity.
Rule 2: A compound containing multiple rings or aromatic systems may have higher chances of causing adverse effects due to increased lipophilicity and membrane permeability.
Explanation: These structural features can facilitate transport across cell membranes and enhance interactions with target proteins.
Rule 3: Compounds with high molecular weight and complex structures tend to be more toxic than those with low molecular weights and simple structures.
Explanation: High molecular weight compounds often have lower solubility and slower clearance rates, which can lead to prolonged exposure and accumulation within cells. This can result in cellular damage and adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains two or more benzene rings connected by single bonds, it may have adverse effects on the human body. This rule applies to the second SMILES string in the dataset where there are multiple benzene rings present.
Rule 2: If a compound has a functional group such as carbonyl (C=O), it may cause adverse effects if it is part of a larger ring structure like in the third SMILES string. The presence of this functional group makes the compound more reactive which can lead to toxicity.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a sulfhydryl (SH) group, it may also cause adverse effects due to its ability to bind to proteins and disrupt their function. This rule applies to the fourth SMILES string where there is a sulfhydryl group present.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as nitro, halogen, carbonyl, and carboxylic acid in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Explanation: These functional groups increase the reactivity of the compound, which may lead to interactions with other molecules or biological systems. This can result in toxic or adverse reactions.
Example: The first SMILES string contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a fluorine atom (F), which may contribute to the compound's ability to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: A compound containing multiple aromatic rings has a higher chance of causing adverse effects than one with only one ring.
Explanation: Aromatic rings are planar and have a high degree of electron delocalization, making them more reactive and potentially more toxic.
Example: The third SMILES string contains two benzene rings connected by a single bond, which may make it more likely to cause adverse effects compared to compounds with just one ring.
Rule 3: Compounds with a high molecular weight and complex structure tend to be less soluble in water and more likely to accumulate in tissues, leading to toxicity.
Explanation: High molecular weight compounds may have difficulty crossing cell membranes and reaching their target sites, while those with complex structures may have more binding sites for interaction with biological molecules. Both factors can increase the risk of adverse effects.
Example: The last SMILES string contains a large number of atoms and several functional groups, which may contribute to its potential toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen group such as chlorine (-Cl) attached to an aromatic ring, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in humans. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, the first molecule in the list contains both a nitro group and a chlorine atom on its benzene ring, which may contribute to its side-effect activity.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) adjacent to a nitrogen atom, then it also has a high probability of causing adverse effects in humans. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, the second molecule in the list contains a carbonyl group next to a nitrogen atom, which may be responsible for its side-effect activity.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a sulfhydryl group (-SH), then it has a low probability of causing adverse effects in humans. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 0 in the given dataset. For example, the last molecule in the list contains a sulfhydryl group, which may explain why it does not have any reported side-effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of bromine in the molecular structure may indicate potential side effects such as general disorders and administration site conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with CC[N+](C)(C)CC1=CC=CC=C1Br.
Rule 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecular structure may also suggest potential side effects such as general disorders and administration site conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with C1=CN(C=N1)CC(O)(P(=O)(O)O)P(=O)(O)O.
Rule 3: The presence of a carbonyl group (-C=O) in the molecular structure may indicate potential side effects such as general disorders and administration site conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with CCCOC(=O)C(CCC1=CC=CC=C1)NC(C)C(=O)N2C3CCCCC3CC2C(=O)O or C1CCC(C(C1)[NH-])[NH-].C(=O)(C(=O)O)O.[Pt+2].

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) or nitro group (NO2) in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. This rule can be applied to molecules with labels 1 for CC(=O)NC1=CC=C(C=C1)O, C1=CC=C(C=C1)CO, CN(C)CCCN1C2=CC=CC=C2CCC3=CC=CC=C31, N(=O)[O-], CCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)N[C@@H](C)C(=O)N1[C@H]2CCCC[C@H]2C[C@H]1C(=O)O, COCCCC(C)(C)C(=O)O, OCCCCCOC2=CC=C(C=C2)C(=N)N, CON=C(C1=CC=CO1)C(=O)NC2C3N(C2=O)C(=C(CS3)COC(=O)N)C(=O)[O-], CCS(=O)(=O)[O-], COP(=O)(O)O[C@@H]3[C@H](O[C@H]([C@@H]3O)N4C=CC(=O)NC4=O)CO, CNC(=O)c1ccc(cc1)C(=O)Nc2ccccc2, c1ccc(nc2nccc(c3ccccc3)n2)o1, NCC(C)(C)C#N, CCN(CCOc1ccccc1Cl)C(=O)N2C=CN=C2, Clc1ccc(cn2nnc(C)s2)o1, CClc3ccccc3C(=NNC(=S)N)c2ccccc21, NC(=O)C(Cn1cc(C(F)(F)F)ccc1)C1=CC=CC=C1, OC(=O)C(C)(C)C(=O)O, FCC(F)(F)CFc1ccc(oc2ccc(cf3cc(F)ccc3F)cc2)cc1, FCNN(C)C(=O)C(C)(C)C(=O)O, CF3C(F)(F)FC(F)(F)C(F)(F

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Explanation: Sulfonamides and nitro compounds are known to have antimicrobial properties but they also have the potential to cause adverse reactions in some individuals. These groups can interfere with the body's normal functioning by inhibiting certain enzymes involved in metabolic processes. Therefore, if a compound contains these functional groups, it may be more likely to cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and hypersensitivity reactions.
Rule 2: If a compound has a polar surface area greater than 70 Å^2, then it may have side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Explanation: Polar surface area is a measure of how much a compound interacts with water molecules. Compounds with high polar surface areas tend to be more soluble in water and can easily penetrate cell membranes, which can lead to toxicity and other adverse effects. Therefore, if a compound has a polar surface area greater than 70 Å^2, it may be more likely to cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and liver damage.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have side effects related to general disorders and administration site conditions.
Explanation: Halogen atoms are known to increase the potency of drugs due to their electron-withdrawing properties. However, they can also increase the reactivity of the compound, leading to increased toxicity and other adverse effects. Therefore, if a compound contains a halogen atom attached to an aromatic ring, it may be more likely to cause side effects such as skin irritation, headache, dizziness, and fatigue.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of iodine atoms in the molecular structure may indicate potential side effects associated with general disorders and administration site conditions.
Rule 2: The presence of boron atom in the molecular structure may also suggest possible side effects due to its reactivity towards biological molecules such as proteins or enzymes.
Rule 3: The presence of carbonyl group (C=O) in the molecular structure may increase the likelihood of causing adverse reactions if the compound is administered orally.
