Rule 1: If there is a presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in the structure of a molecule, then it may lead to adverse effects such as gastrointestinal disorders or other health issues. This rule applies to molecules #1 and #10.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it may also lead to adverse effects such as gastrointestinal disorders or allergic reactions. This rule applies to molecule #11.
Rule 3: If a molecule has a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) attached to an aromatic ring, it may increase its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and potentially cause central nervous system depression or other neurological problems. This rule applies to molecule #12.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the human body.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to cause various types of toxicity, including skin irritation, liver damage, and allergic reactions. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety before being used in drug development.
Rule 2: A compound with a high molecular weight or a large number of rotatable bonds may also increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects due to its increased flexibility and ability to interact with biological molecules.
Explanation: High molecular weight and flexible structures can lead to poor absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) characteristics, which can result in reduced efficacy and increased risk of adverse events.
Rule 3: Compounds with certain structural features, such as aromatic rings, heterocyclic systems, and conjugated double bonds, may also contribute to their potential for causing adverse effects by interacting with biological targets and disrupting normal cellular processes.
Explanation: These structural features can enhance the lipophilicity and reactivity of a compound, leading to increased bioavailability and interaction with critical enzymes and receptors involved in metabolic pathways and other physiological functions.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to gastrointestinal disorders:
1. If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a nitrate group (-ONO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C(C(CO[N+](=O)[O-])O[N+](=O)[O-])O[N+](=O)[O-] and CC(C1=CC2=C(C=C1)C=C(C=C2)OC)C(=O)[O-].
2. If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C[C@H]([C@@H](CO)NC(=O)C1CSSCC(C(=O)NC(C(=O)NC(C(=O)NC(C(=O)NC(C(=O)N1)C(C)O)CCCCN)CC2=CNC3=CC=CC=C32)CC4=CC=CC=C4)NC(=O)C(CC5

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) and a chlorine atom (Cl) attached to a benzene ring, then it has a high probability of causing gastrointestinal disorders as a side effect. The presence of these functional groups may increase the permeability of the cell membrane, leading to increased absorption of the drug in the digestive system.
Example: C1=CC(=C(C(=C1)Cl)CC(=O)N=C(N)N)Cl 1
Rule 2: If a compound contains a guanidine group (-NH-C(=NH2)-NH-) and a fluorine atom (F) at position 9 on the anthracene ring, then it does not have a high probability of causing gastrointestinal disorders as a side effect. This is because the guanidine group acts as a hydrogen bond donor, which increases the solubility of the compound in water and reduces its ability to penetrate the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane.
Example: CC12CCC3C(C1CCC2=O)CCC4=C3C=CC(=C4)O 1
Rule 3: If a compound contains a thiadiazole ring (C2N2S) and a carbonyl group (C=O) adjacent to each other, then it has a moderate probability of causing gastrointestinal disorders as a side effect. This is because the thiadiazole ring is known to be biologically active and may interact with biological molecules such as enzymes or receptors. However, further research is needed to determine the exact mechanism of action.
Example: CCC(=O)NSSCC(=O)ON 1

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 and 8.
Rule 2: A compound containing a sulfonamide functional group (-SO2NH2) may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 and 9.
Rule 3: A compound containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) may be less likely to cause adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 and 10.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and carboxylic acid in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, the first molecule contains a sulfonamide group which has been associated with gastrointestinal toxicity.
Rule 2: The absence of certain structural features such as aromatic rings or double bonds in a compound may decrease its likelihood of causing adverse effects. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 0 in the given dataset. For instance, the last molecule does not contain any aromatic ring or double bond, making it less likely to cause adverse effects compared to other molecules in the dataset.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound may also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects. Compounds with higher molecular weights and lower log P values tend to have greater bioavailability and permeability across cell membranes, increasing their potential to cause adverse effects. However, these factors alone do not necessarily determine the severity of the adverse effects, and additional factors such as metabolism and pharmacokinetics must also be considered.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carboxylic acid or its derivatives, amides and amines in a compound may increase the likelihood of causing gastrointestinal disorders. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 for their potential association with these types of adverse effects. For example, the first molecule contains a carboxylic acid group which could contribute to this type of toxicity.
Rule 2: The presence of certain atoms or fragments in a molecule may also indicate its potential to cause adverse effects. For instance, the second molecule contains sodium ions which may affect its solubility and bioavailability. Therefore, compounds containing sodium ions should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and lipophilicity of a compound may play a role in determining its ability to cross biological membranes and interact with target receptors. Compounds with high molecular weights and low lipophilicities may have limited access to target sites within the body and therefore exhibit lower levels of toxicity. However, exceptions to this general trend do exist and further analysis would be required to establish more specific structure-activity relationships.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of barium ion in the molecular formula indicates that the compound may have some adverse effects on the digestive system.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a silver ion and a sulfonamide group, it suggests that the compound has antibacterial properties and could potentially cause adverse reactions in the body if taken in high doses or for prolonged periods.
Rule 3: A molecule containing both chlorine atoms and a nitrile group may be associated with skin irritation and other adverse health effects when exposed to sunlight.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and has a molecular weight less than or equal to 500 Daltons, then it may have a potential side-effect on the gastrointestinal system.
Explanation: The sulfonamide group is known for its antibacterial property but it can also irritate the stomach lining if taken in high doses. Therefore, compounds containing this functional group should be avoided if they have a low molecular weight as they tend to be more soluble and absorbable through the digestive tract.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) and has a molecular weight greater than 500 Daltons, then it may have a potential side-effect on the cardiovascular system.
Explanation: Nitro groups are known for their explosive nature but they can also cause vasodilation and increase heart rate when exposed to high concentrations. Therefore, compounds containing this functional group should be avoided if they have a high molecular weight as they tend to accumulate in the body over time.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and has a molecular weight between 180 and 600 Daltons, then it may have a potential side-effect on the skin.
Explanation: Carboxylic acids are known for their ability to penetrate the skin barrier and cause irritation. Therefore, compounds containing this functional group should be avoided if they have a moderate molecular weight as they tend to be more volatile and easily absorbed by the skin.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, the first molecule contains a nitro group and has been associated with gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 2: A compound containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a double bond between two carbon atoms (C=C) may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 or 0 in the given dataset. For instance, the second molecule contains both a carbonyl group and a C=C bond and has also been linked to gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 3: A compound having a heterocyclic ring structure may have a lower risk of causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system compared to compounds without such a structure. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as either 1 or 0 in the given dataset. For example, the third molecule does not contain any heterocycle but has been reported to cause gastrointestinal problems. On the other hand, the fourth molecule contains a heterocyclic ring and has not been associated with gastrointestinal disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amides and nitriles in a compound may increase its potential for causing gastrointestinal disorders. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, the first molecule contains two amide groups and one nitrile group, which could contribute to its side-effect activity.
Rule 2: The absence of certain functional groups or structural features in a compound may decrease its likelihood of causing gastrointestinal disorders. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 0 in the given dataset. For instance, the last molecule does not contain any functional groups commonly associated with gastrointestinal disorders, such as carboxylic acids or alcohols, and therefore has a lower chance of exhibiting this type of activity.
Rule 3: The size and complexity of a molecule may also play a role in determining its ability to cause gastrointestinal disorders. Larger and more complex compounds may have a higher probability of interacting with biological systems in ways that lead to adverse effects. However, this rule should be used cautiously because other factors, such as solubility and bioavailability, may also influence the overall toxicity of a compound.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a compound may increase its likelihood of causing gastrointestinal disorders as a side effect. This rule can be inferred from the fact that two out of three molecules labeled as 1 contain a sulfonamide group while none of the molecules labeled as 0 do.
Rule 2: A compound containing a carboxylic acid group and an amide group may have a higher chance of causing gastrointestinal disorders if it also contains a benzene ring or a heterocyclic ring. This rule can be inferred from the fact that one molecule labeled as 1 contains both a carboxylic acid group and an amide group along with a benzene ring, while another molecule labeled as 1 contains both groups along with a heterocyclic ring. None of the molecules labeled as 0 contain both these functional groups along with any type of aromatic ring.
Rule 3: A compound containing a nitro group may have a lower chance of causing gastrointestinal disorders compared to compounds without this group. This rule can be inferred from the fact that only one molecule labeled as 1 does not contain a nitro group, while all other molecules labeled as 1 contain at least one nitro group.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) in conjugation with a double bond or aromatic ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C/C=C(/C)\C(=O)O[C@H]1C(=C[C@@]23[C@@]1([C@@H](C(=C[C@H](C2=O)[C@H]4[C@H](C4(C)C)C[C@H]3C)CO)O)O)C, CC1=C(C(CCC1)(C)C)C=CC(=CC=CC(=CC(=O)O)C)C, CN\1C=CC=C/C1=C\[NH+]=O, CCC1C(OCCN1C)C2=CC=CC=C2, COC(=O)C2(C)CC[C@H](C3=CC(=O)C=C[C@@]3(C)C[C@@H](C(=C[C@H](C4=CC(=O)C=C[

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to gastrointestinal disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group called "nitrile" (-CN) or "isocyanate" (-N=C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 7 and 8 in the provided dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 9, 10, 11, and 12 in the provided dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5) or a naphthalene ring (C10H8), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 13, 14, and 15 in the provided dataset.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a compound may increase its likelihood of causing gastrointestinal disorders as a side effect. This rule can be applied to molecules such as C1 and CC1=C(SC=C1)C(=CCCN2CCCC(C2)C(=O)O)C3=C(C=CS3)C.
Rule 2: A compound containing a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine at certain positions on the molecule may also increase the risk of causing gastrointestinal disorders as a side effect. For example, compounds like N and CCC(=O)N(CC(CN(C1=C(C(=C(C(=C1I)C(=O)NCC(CO)O)I)C(=O)NCC(CO)O)I)C(=O)C)O)C2=C(C(=C(C(=C2I)C(=O)NCC(CO)O)I)C(=O)NCC(CO)O)I have a halogen atom present which may contribute to their potential side effects.
Rule 3: Compounds containing a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring may also increase the risk of causing gastrointestinal disorders as a side effect due to the acidic nature of the nitro group. Examples include compounds like O and CN1C(CNN2C3=CC=CC=C3SS4=C2C=C(C=C4)Br)CNS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(cc2)n2ccccc

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like "-CN" or "-NO2" in the structure of a molecule, then it may lead to adverse effects on the human body. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings starting from line number 7 onwards. For example, in the first SMILES string, the presence of "-CN" and "-NO2" groups makes this molecule potentially harmful for causing gastric problems.
Rule 2: If a molecule has a long carbon chain with multiple rings attached to it, it may also have potential adverse effects due to its high lipophilicity. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings starting from line number 9 onwards. For instance, in the second SMILES string, the presence of a long alkyl chain with two fused benzene rings increases the chances of this molecule being toxic.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it may be associated with adverse reactions such as skin rashes, fevers, and other allergic responses. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings starting from line number 18 onwards. For example, in the fifth SMILES string, the presence of a sulfonamide group makes this molecule highly allergenic.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group and carboxylic acid group in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system due to their ability to interact with biological molecules.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a compound's structure may also play a role in determining its potential to cause adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system. Compounds with longer chains or more complex structures may be harder to digest and absorb, leading to increased likelihood of negative impacts on the digestive system.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system.
Explanation: Sulfonamides and nitro groups are known to have antimicrobial properties and are commonly used in antibiotics. However, these compounds can also irritate the digestive tract and cause adverse reactions in some individuals. Therefore, the presence of these functional groups in a compound could be a warning sign of potential gastrointestinal toxicity.
Rule 2: A compound containing a heterocyclic ring structure may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system compared to those without this structural feature.
Explanation: Heterocyclic rings are often found in medicinal drugs and can confer unique chemical and biological properties to the compound. However, they can also increase the compound's reactivity and potentially lead to toxic side effects. Therefore, the presence of a heterocyclic ring in a compound could indicate a higher risk of gastrointestinal toxicity.
Rule 3: A compound containing a polar group such as a carboxylic acid or phosphate group may have a lower likelihood of causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system compared to those without these features.
Explanation: Polar groups can increase the water solubility of a compound and make it more easily absorbed by the body. However, they can also increase the compound's reactivity and potentially lead to unwanted interactions with other molecules within the body. Therefore, the absence of polar groups in a compound could indicate a higher risk of gastrointestinal toxicity due to decreased absorption and increased reactivity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains the substructure "COCCCCC(=NoCCn)c1ccc(cc1)C(f)(f)f" or "CCCCCCC(=OnOc1ccccc1C)o1ccc(cc1)C", then it is likely to have side-effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains the substructure "CON=C1cn(Cc2nnnc2Cn2Nc3ccccc3C(=O)NN2C)c2ccccc12", then it is also likely to have side-effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule does not contain any of these substructures, but contains the substructure "CCOC(=O)CC(C(=O)OCC)sp(=S)(oc)oc", then it may not have side-effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
Note that these rules are based solely on the provided dataset and may not generalize well to other molecules. It's important to use caution when making predictions about the safety of new molecules.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to gastrointestinal disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a similar functional group, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to molecules 7 and 8.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to molecules 9 and 10.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to molecules 11 and 12.
Note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the given dataset and should be used as a starting point for further analysis rather than definitive conclusions.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a metal ion such as iron (Fe), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to the first SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom (-F) and a carbonyl group (-C=O), along with a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom (-N-C=O), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to the second SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 1.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a benzene ring (-C6H5) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), along with a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to one of the carbons in the ring, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to the third SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 0.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided by this small dataset and should be used cautiously until further research and testing can confirm their validity.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the nitro group (-NO2) and the sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) have been associated with gastrointestinal toxicity. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their potential side effects.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule may also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects. Molecules with a larger surface area or more flexible structures may be more likely to interact with biological targets and disrupt normal cellular processes. Therefore, molecules with bulky or rigid structures may be less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule may affect its potency and efficacy as well as its propensity to cause adverse effects. For example, the configuration of chiral centers in a molecule can influence its interaction with receptors and enzymes. Therefore, molecules with different configurations at chiral centers may exhibit different pharmacological activities and safety profiles.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like "-COOH" or "-OH" in the structure of a molecule, then it may lead to adverse effects on the human body due to its acidic nature and ability to form hydrogen bonds which can affect protein folding and other biological processes. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: Molecules having aromatic rings such as benzene or pyridine may also have potential adverse effects due to their planarity and ability to interact with proteins through π-π stacking interactions. Hence, they should be used cautiously especially when administered at high doses for prolonged periods.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure can also play a role in determining its toxicity. Longer chains and more complex structures tend to have higher lipophilicity and may accumulate in tissues leading to toxic effects. Therefore, simpler compounds with fewer functional groups and less bulky substituents may be safer options.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to irritate the stomach lining and lead to nausea or vomiting. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully monitored for their potential to cause gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 2: Compounds with a high degree of conjugation between π bonds may also increase the risk of causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system. This is because conjugated systems tend to be more reactive and can interact with biological molecules in unexpected ways.
Explanation: Conjugated systems can form stable radicals which can damage cells and tissues. They can also act as electron acceptors or donors, interfering with normal biochemical processes. Therefore, compounds with highly conjugated structures should be evaluated cautiously for their potential to cause gastrointestinal problems.
Rule 3: The number and position of halogen atoms in a compound can affect its ability to cross cell membranes and reach target sites within the body. Therefore, compounds with multiple halogens should be evaluated for their potential to cause adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system.
Explanation: Halogen atoms can increase the polarity and water solubility of a compound, making it easier for it to cross cell membranes. However, they can also increase the reactivity of the compound and potentially cause harm to biological molecules. Therefore, the location and number of halogen atoms in a compound should be taken into consideration when evaluating its potential to cause gastrointestinal disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group and sulfonyl group in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system.
Rule 2: A compound containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine attached to aromatic rings may have higher chances of causing adverse effects on the digestive system.
Rule 3: Compounds having nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring structures may also exhibit similar behavior towards the gastrointestinal tract.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amides and carboxylic acids in a compound may increase its potential for causing gastrointestinal disorders.
Explanation: These functional groups can irritate the digestive system and lead to discomfort or pain.
Rule 2: A compound containing multiple rings or aromatic structures may have a higher likelihood of causing gastrointestinal disorders due to their rigid and planar nature.
Explanation: This structure can interfere with the normal functioning of the digestive tract and cause irritation.
Rule 3: Compounds with high molecular weight or complex structures may be less likely to cross the cell membrane and enter the bloodstream, reducing their ability to cause systemic effects.
Explanation: Such compounds may require more time or energy to break down into smaller molecules that can penetrate cells and affect internal organs.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of negatively charged atoms such as oxygen and nitrogen in a compound increases its likelihood of causing GI disorders. This rule can be inferred from the fact that many drugs that cause GI disorders contain these electronegative elements. For example, the compound C1CC(CCC1OP(=O)([O-])OC[C@@H](CN(CCN(CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])N(CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])(C2=CC=CC=C2)C3=CC=CC=C3 contains two negatively charged oxygen atoms which may contribute to its ability to cause GI disorders.
Rule 2: Compounds containing functional groups like sulfonates or phosphates have a higher chance of causing GI disorders than those without them. This rule can be derived from the observation that some drugs that cause GI disorders contain these functional groups. For instance, the compound CNS(=O)(=O)CC1=CC2=C(C=C1)NC=C2CCN(C)C contains a sulfonate group which may contribute to its potential to cause GI disorders.
Rule 3: Molecules with a high degree of symmetry tend to have lower chances of causing GI disorders compared to asymmetric molecules. This rule can be deduced by analyzing the structures of compounds that do not cause GI disorders. For example, the compound CC(C)

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a compound increases its likelihood of causing gastrointestinal disorders as a side effect. This rule applies to molecules with the SMILES string CC(C(=O)NCC(=O)O)S and those with CNSCC(=O)ONCC(=O)OS.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a gadolinium ion has a higher chance of causing gastrointestinal disorders if it also contains a nitro group attached to the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group. This rule applies to molecules with the SMILES string CC(CN1CCN(CCN(CCN(CC1)CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])O.[Gd+3].
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen-containing ring structure such as pyridine or pyrimidine, it may have a lower risk of causing gastrointestinal disorders compared to other types of rings. This rule applies to molecules with the SMILES strings CCNNHC(=O)C1=CC=C(C=C1)N and CCCN(CC)C(=O)C1=CC=C(C=C1)NS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(cc2)Oc2ccccc2.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to gastrointestinal disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to molecules 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects on the digestive system. The presence of these functional groups in a compound can increase its acidity and hydrophobicity, which can lead to irritation and inflammation of the stomach lining. Therefore, molecules containing such groups should be labeled as having potential side effects on the digestive system.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring, then it may also have potential side effects on the digestive system. Benzene rings are known to be toxic and can irritate the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract. They can also disrupt normal cell function by binding to proteins and DNA, leading to cellular damage and cancer. Therefore, molecules containing benzene rings should also be labeled as having potential side effects on the digestive system.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), then it may not have any significant side effects on the digestive system. Carboxylic acids are essential for many biological processes and play important roles in maintaining body health. However, if the concentration of carboxylic acid in a compound is high enough, it can irritate the mouth and throat, causing soreness and discomfort. Therefore, molecules containing only carboxylic acid groups should be labeled as safe for use without any significant side effects on the digestive system.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like "-COOH" or "-OH" in the structure of a molecule, then it may lead to adverse effects on the human body due to its acidic nature and ability to form hydrogen bonds which can affect protein folding and other biological processes. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be avoided if possible.
Example: Molecule no. 6 has a "-COOH" group present in its structure and hence it may have potential adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains aromatic rings such as benzene or pyridine, they may also contribute to adverse effects by interacting with proteins and enzymes in the body. Hence, molecules containing these rings should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.
Example: Molecule no. 8 has a benzene ring present in its structure and therefore it needs careful evaluation before being used in any application.
Rule 3: Molecules having a high degree of symmetry or planarity may exhibit adverse effects due to their tendency to intercalate between DNA base pairs leading to mutations and cancer. Therefore, molecules possessing this property should be cautiously considered while designing new drugs.
Example: Molecule no. 9 has a highly symmetric structure and thus it requires cautionary use.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) and nitro group (NO2) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract. This rule can be applied to molecules 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82,

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and carboxylic acid in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract.
Explanation: Sulfonamides and carboxylic acids are known to irritate the stomach lining and can lead to nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These functional groups may also affect the absorption of other drugs taken together with them.
Rule 2: A compound containing a benzene ring or a heterocyclic ring may have a higher chance of causing adverse effects than one without these rings.
Explanation: Benzene and heterocyclic rings are often associated with toxicity due to their ability to bind to proteins and disrupt normal cellular processes. They can also be metabolized into reactive intermediates that can damage DNA and other macromolecules.
Rule 3: Compounds with high molecular weight and complex structures may have a lower likelihood of being absorbed by the body and therefore have a reduced risk of causing adverse effects.
Explanation: Large molecules may be less likely to cross cell membranes and enter the bloodstream, reducing their exposure to target organs and tissues. Additionally, they may be more susceptible to degradation by enzymes and other biological agents before reaching their targets.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and amide in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to form hydrogen bonds with proteins and other molecules within the body, which can disrupt their normal function and lead to negative consequences. For example, the sulfonyl group found in some drugs used to treat diabetes can bind to insulin receptors and prevent them from functioning properly, leading to hyperglycemia and other complications.
Rule 2: A compound containing multiple aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also be more likely to cause adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system due to its hydrophobic nature and tendency to accumulate in tissues.
Explanation: Aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds are often associated with high lipophilicity, which allows compounds containing these structures to easily cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets. This can lead to toxic effects and potentially harmful interactions with other molecules within the body.
Rule 3: Compounds containing certain atoms or atomic combinations, such as iron or nitrogen, may also be more prone to causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system.
Explanation: Iron is a metal ion that plays important roles in many biological processes, but excessive exposure to iron can lead to oxidative stress and tissue damage. Nitrogen-containing compounds, such as amines and amides, can react with other substances in the body to form toxic metabolites that can cause inflammation and other negative effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as nitro groups or halogen groups in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a heterocyclic ring structure may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system compared to molecules without this structural feature.
Rule 3: Molecules with a high molecular weight and complex structure may be more likely to cause adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system due to their ability to penetrate cell membranes and interact with biological systems.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the human body. This rule can be applied to identify molecules that have a high probability of causing gastrointestinal disorders or other types of adverse effects.
Rule 2: A compound containing multiple aromatic rings may also have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects due to their ability to interact with biological systems. Therefore, compounds with multiple benzene rings should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxicity.
Rule 3: Compounds with a molecular weight greater than 500 Daltons may have limited bioavailability and may require specialized delivery methods to ensure effective absorption into the bloodstream. These compounds should be evaluated for their potential to cause adverse effects based on their pharmacokinetic profile rather than just their chemical structure.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a sulfonamide group in a drug molecule has been linked to gastrointestinal disorders as a side effect. Therefore, if a molecule contains such a group, it should be labeled as having potential for causing this type of adverse effect.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule may also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects. For instance, molecules with a large surface area or a non-planar structure may have greater access to biological targets and therefore be more likely to interact with them and cause harm. Therefore, molecules with these characteristics should be labeled as potentially harmful.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule may also affect its ability to cause adverse effects. For example, some drugs may have one enantiomer that is active while the other is inactive or less active. Therefore, if a molecule contains only one enantiomer, it should be labeled as potentially harmful until its activity is confirmed experimentally.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the human body.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to cause various types of toxicity, including gastrointestinal disturbances, skin irritation, and allergic reactions. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles before being used in clinical settings or marketed as drugs.
Rule 2: Compounds with a high degree of lipophilicity tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues like the liver and brain, which can lead to toxic effects.
Explanation: Highly lipophilic molecules can easily cross cell membranes and enter into cells, where they can interfere with normal cellular processes and cause damage. This property should be taken into consideration when designing new drug candidates to minimize their potential toxicity.
Rule 3: The presence of certain structural features in a compound, such as aromatic rings, conjugated double bonds, and heterocyclic systems, can enhance its ability to interact with biological targets and modulate their functions. However, excessive exposure to these structures can also increase the risk of adverse effects due to non-specific interactions with other biomolecules.
Explanation: Aromatic rings, for example, are commonly found in many pharmaceuticals and can confer desirable properties such as increased stability and membrane permeability. However, they can also interact with proteins and enzymes in unintended ways, leading to off-target effects and toxicity. Therefore, the optimal balance between efficacy and safety must be achieved through careful design and evaluation of novel chemical entities.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects such as gastrointestinal disorders or liver damage. The presence of this functional group can increase the polarity and hydrophilicity of the molecule, which can affect its absorption and distribution within the body.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br), then it may also lead to adverse effects such as gastrointestinal disorders or liver damage. Halogen atoms can increase the lipophilicity of the molecule, which can affect its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets.
Rule 3: If the molecule has a conjugated system of double bonds, then it may have a higher potential for toxicity due to increased reactivity and susceptibility to oxidation. This can lead to adverse effects such as skin irritation, respiratory problems, or cancer.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) and sulfonyl group (SO2R) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system.
Explanation: These functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to negative consequences. For example, the C=O group can form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues in proteins, altering their structure and function. Similarly, the SO2R group can react with enzymes or other proteins, inhibiting their activities.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system.
Explanation: Aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds can enhance the compound's ability to interact with biological molecules through π-π stacking interactions or electrostatic forces. This increased interaction can lead to more significant disruptions in cellular processes and potentially harmful outcomes.
Rule 3: Compounds with a high degree of lipophilicity tend to be more likely to cause adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system.
Explanation: Lipophilic compounds are more likely to penetrate cell membranes and interact with intracellular targets, which can lead to negative impacts on cellular processes. Additionally, lipophilic compounds may accumulate in tissues and organs, increasing their exposure to the body over time.

Rule 3: If the molecule contains functional groups such as carbonyl groups, carboxyl groups, or sulfonyl groups, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to the fifth through eighth SMILES strings labeled as 1.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the given dataset and should be used cautiously until further research is conducted.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system. This rule can be applied to compounds labeled 1 in the given dataset. For example, the first compound contains a sulfonamide group which has been known to cause gastrointestinal irritation.
Rule 2: The presence of halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine in a compound may also increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system. This rule can be applied to compounds labeled 1 in the given dataset. For example, the fourth compound contains two chlorine atoms which may contribute to its ability to irritate the gastrointestinal tract.
Rule 3: The absence of certain structural features such as aromatic rings or double bonds may decrease the likelihood of a compound causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amides and carboxylic acids in a compound may increase its potential for causing gastrointestinal disorders. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1[C@@H]([C@H](O[C@H]1N2C=C(C(=O)NC2=O)C(F)(F)F)CO)O, CC(C)NCC(C1=CC(=CC(=C1)O)O)O, CN(C)CCCN1C2=CC=CC=C2CCC3=C1C=C(C=C3)Cl, CCC1=C(C=CC2=C1C(=NC(=N2)N)N)CNC3=CC(=C(C(=C3)OC)OC)OC.C(=O)[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O, CCS(=O)(=O)NNC(=O)c2ccc(cc2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3n2nc(cn1)c1ccccc1, COC(=O)C(CCNS(=O)(=O)Oc4ccccc4Cn1nnc2c1ccccc12)SCC(=O)ON1CCOCC1, CNC(=O

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like "-COOH" or "-OH" in the structure of a molecule, then it may lead to gastrointestinal disorder as these groups increase the permeability of the cell membrane and affect its function. Therefore, molecules containing such groups should be avoided if they have any potential for causing adverse effects on the digestive system.
Rule 2: Molecules having aromatic rings in their structures tend to bind strongly to biological receptors due to π-π interactions which can result in adverse reactions. Hence, compounds possessing such moieties must be carefully evaluated before being used in drug development processes.
Rule 3: The length and flexibility of a molecule's carbon chain also play important roles in determining its toxicity profile. Longer chains often make the compound more lipophilic, leading to increased absorption into cells and tissues. Additionally, flexible chains allow for greater conformational changes during interaction with target proteins, potentially enhancing binding affinity. Therefore, molecules with long and flexible carbon chains should be cautiously considered when designing new drugs.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to irritate the stomach lining and lead to nausea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their potential to cause adverse effects on the digestive system.
Rule 2: Compounds with a high degree of lipophilicity tend to accumulate in adipose tissue and may cause adverse effects due to prolonged exposure over time.
Explanation: Highly lipophilic compounds may remain in the body for longer periods of time, leading to chronic toxicity or other long-term health problems. Therefore, compounds with high lipid solubility should be closely monitored for any potential adverse effects.
Rule 3: Compounds with a molecular weight greater than 500 Daltons may have difficulty crossing cell membranes and may require specialized transport mechanisms to enter cells. This could potentially limit their bioavailability and reduce their ability to cause adverse effects.
Explanation: Large molecules may have limited access to target sites within cells, reducing their effectiveness at causing toxic effects. Therefore, compounds with a molecular weight above 500 Daltons should be evaluated cautiously for their potential to cause adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to gastrointestinal disorders:

Rule 2: A molecule containing a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group may also have an increased risk of causing gastrointestinal disorders as a side effect. This rule applies to molecules such as CC12CCC3C(C1CCC2OP(=O)(O)O)CCC4=C3C=CC(=C4)OC(=O)N(CCCl)CCCl.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a nitro group or a nitrile group may be less likely to cause gastrointestinal disorders as a side effect compared to those containing a sulfonamide group or a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group. This rule applies to molecules such as CN(C)C(=O)C(CC[NH+]1CCC(CC1)(C2=CC=C(C=C2)Cl)O)(C3=CC=CC=C3)C4=CC=CC=C4 and CCC[C@@H](C(=O)OCC)N[C@H](C)C(=O)N1[C@H]2CCCC[C@H]2C[C@H]1C(=O)O.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential adverse effects on the human body.
Explanation: Sulfonamides and nitro compounds are known to be toxic and can cause various health problems such as skin irritation, respiratory distress, and even cancer. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety before being used in medical applications.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure has a high number of rotatable bonds, then it may have a higher chance of causing adverse effects due to its flexibility.
Explanation: Rotatable bonds allow the molecule to change its shape easily, which can affect its interaction with other molecules and biological systems. Molecules with many rotatable bonds tend to be more flexible and may have a greater likelihood of interacting with proteins and enzymes in unexpected ways.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), then it may have potential adverse effects on the central nervous system (CNS).
Explanation: Carboxylic acids are known to be irritants to the eyes and skin, and some studies suggest they can cross the blood-brain barrier and interfere with brain function. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should be cautiously considered when designing drugs intended for CNS targets.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of iron in the molecular structure may indicate potential gastrointestinal disorder side effects. This rule could be based on research showing that certain metals such as iron can irritate the digestive system and lead to symptoms like nausea or vomiting.
Rule 2: The presence of chlorine atoms in the molecular structure may also indicate potential gastrointestinal disorder side effects. This rule could be based on research showing that some chemicals containing chlorine atoms have been linked to stomach irritation and other gastrointestinal issues.
Rule 3: The absence of specific functional groups or chemical motifs in the molecular structure may suggest a lower likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the molecules without any phosphate groups or sulfur-containing moieties may be less likely to cause gastrointestinal problems. However, these rules should be used cautiously and only as a starting point for further analysis and testing.
