Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as CN or NO2, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. The presence of these groups may increase the reactivity of the molecule and lead to interactions with biological molecules.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring, then it also has a high probability of causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. Benzene is known to be carcinogenic and can disrupt normal cell growth and division.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a long carbon chain, then it may have low toxicity but could potentially interfere with lipid metabolism in the body. This could lead to changes in cholesterol levels and other metabolic processes.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. The first two molecules in the dataset contain this functional group and they both have label 1 indicating their potential side-effects.
Rule 2: If a compound has a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, it may also have adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. The third molecule in the dataset contains this functional group but it has label 0 suggesting that other factors may be involved in its toxicity.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, it may have adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. The last three molecules in the dataset all contain these atoms and they all have label 1 indicating their potential side-effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to blood and lymphatic system disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a phosphate group (-OPO3-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to blood and lymphatic system disorders. This rule applies to molecules B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, AA, AB, AC, AD, AE, AF, AG, AH, AI, AJ, AK, AL, AM, AN, AO, AP, AQ, AR, AS, AT, AU, AV, AW, AX, AY, AZ, BA, BB, BC, BD, BE, BF, BG, BH, BI, BJ, BK, BL, BM, BN, BO, BP, BQ, BR, BS, BT, BU, BV, BW, BX, BY, BZ, CA, CB, CC, CD, CE, CF, CG, CH, CI, CJ, CK, CL, CM, CN, CO, CP, CQ, CR, CS, CT, CU, CV, CW, CX, CY, CZ, DA, DB, DC, DD, DE, DF, DG, DH, DI, DJ, DK, DL, DM, DN, DO, DP, DQ, DR, DS, DT, DU, DV, DW, DX, DY, DZ, EA, EB, EC, ED, EE, EF, EG, EH, EI, EJ,EK, EL, EM, EN, EO,

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) or carboxyl group (COOH) in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule can be applied to molecules 1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic rings may also have higher chances of causing adverse effects due to their ability to interact with biological receptors. Therefore, this rule can be applied to molecules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
Rule 3: The molecular weight of a compound may affect its bioavailability and toxicity. Generally, smaller molecules tend to be more bioavailable and less toxic than larger ones. However, there may be exceptions to this rule depending on other factors such as chemical structure and mode of action. Therefore, this rule cannot be used alone to predict the potential adverse effects of a molecule but should be considered along with other factors. It can be applied to all molecules listed above.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to blood and lymphatic system disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a benzene ring (represented by the SMILES string C1=CC=CC=C1 or similar), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to blood and lymphatic system disorders. This rule applies to molecules with labels 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule applies to the second molecule in the dataset, which contains a nitro group and is labeled as having side-effect activity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule applies to the fifth molecule in the dataset, which contains a sulfonyl group and is labeled as having side-effect activity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, it may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule applies to the eighth molecule in the dataset, which contains a bromine atom and is labeled as having side-effect activity.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided by this small dataset and should be used cautiously until further research can be conducted.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. The first two molecules in the dataset contain this functional group and they both have label 1 indicating their potential for causing such effects.
Rule 2: Compounds containing carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) may also have adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems if they are conjugated with amines or amides. The third molecule in the dataset contains a carboxylic acid group but it does not have any amine or amide conjugation, so it has label 0.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may be associated with adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems due to its ability to form reactive intermediates under certain conditions. The fifth molecule in the dataset contains a nitro group and it has label 1.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a functional group such as "-COOH" or "-SO3H" in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 for both smiles strings CCC1=CN=C(C=C1)CCOC2=CC=C(C=C2)CC3C(=O)NC(=O)S3 and C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=N)N)OCCCCCOC2=CC=C(C=C2)C(=N)N.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a heterocyclic ring, especially those containing nitrogen atoms like pyridine or pyrimidine, it may also contribute to adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 for both smiles strings CC1[C@@H]2[C@@H](C2N)CN1C3=C(C=C4C(=O)C(=CN(C4=N3)C5=C(C=C(C=C5)F)F)C(=O)O)F and CN1C(=O)CN=C(C2=C1C=CC(=C2)Cl)C3=CC=CC=C3.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure has multiple aromatic rings connected by conjugated double bonds, it may increase its ability to penetrate cell membranes and potentially cause adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 for smiles

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1=NC2=C(C(=N1)N)N=CN2CCOCP(=O)(O)O, CCC(CO)(P(=O)(O)O)P(=O)(O)O)CN, CCCCC[C@@H](C=C[C@H]1[C@@H](C[C@@H]([C@@H]1CC=CCCCC(=O)O)O)O)O.C(C(CO)(CO)N)O, C1C(C2=CC=CC=C2N(C3=CC=CC=C31)C(=O)N)O, CCC1=C2C=C3C(=C(C(=CC4=NC(=CC5=NC(=CC(=C1C)N2)C(=C5CCC(=O)O)C)C(=C4C)CCC(=O)O)N3)C(C)O)C.[Na+], CNC(=O)CN(CCN(CCN(CC(=O)NC)CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-].O.[Gd+3], CCC(CO)NC(=O)C1CN(C2CC3

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonate group (-SO3-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems. The presence of these functional groups indicates that the molecule may interact with proteins or enzymes involved in blood clotting or immune responses.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to a double bond (=C=) followed by two carbon atoms, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems. This structural feature suggests that the molecule may act as an enzyme inhibitor or receptor antagonist, interfering with normal physiological processes.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to four other atoms, including one oxygen atom, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems. This structural motif is characteristic of alkaloids, which are known to have diverse biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antimicrobial effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels indicating their ability to cause such effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group (-C=O) through a single bond, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems. This structure is present in the third molecule in the dataset and its label indicates this possibility.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a conjugated system consisting of alternating double bonds and single bonds, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems. This structure is present in the sixth molecule in the dataset and its label indicates this possibility as well.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. For example, the presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in the second molecule suggests that it could have some potential for causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. Similarly, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in the fifth molecule also suggests that it has some potential for causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule may also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. For instance, the third molecule contains a five-membered ring structure, which may make it more likely to interact with biological molecules and potentially cause adverse effects. On the other hand, the sixth molecule contains a large number of carbon atoms and multiple rings, which may make it less likely to penetrate cell membranes and cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: The charge and polarity of a molecule may affect its ability to cross cell membranes and reach target sites within the body. For example, the seventh molecule contains two negatively charged carboxylate groups (-COO-), which may make it difficult for it to pass through cell membranes and reach its target site inside cells. Therefore, it may be less likely to cause adverse effects compared to neutral or positively charged molecules.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings "CCCNN(CSc1ccc(cc1)I)C(=O)Nc2ccccc2Br", "Oc1ccc(nc2nccs2)no1", "CCON1C(=O)C2(C(=O)NC(=O)C2(C)C)C(=O)N1", "CC(C)NNC(=O)C(C)(C)C(=O)OCC(C)(C)C", "CC(C)CON(C(=O)C(C)(C)C)C(C)(C)C", "CC(C)CNS(=O)(=O)C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O", "CC(C)CNT(C)(C)C", "CC(C)CN(C)C", "CC(C)CN(SCC)C", "CC(C)CN(C(=O)C(C)(C)C)C(C)(C)C", "CC(C)CN(C(=O)C(C)(C)C)C(C)(C)C", "CC(C)CN(C(=O)C(C)(C)C)C(C)(C)C", "CC(C)CN(C(=O)C(C)(C)C)C(C)(C)C", "CC(C)CN(C(=O)C(C)(C)C)C(C)(C)C", "CC(C)CN(C(=O)C(C)(C)C)

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a functional group such as sulfonyl or carbonyl in a compound, then it may have potential side effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. The presence of these groups increases the likelihood of binding to proteins involved in various biological processes leading to toxicity. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: Compounds with aromatic rings attached to them tend to exhibit higher lipophilicity which makes them more likely to cross cell membranes and interact with different cellular components. This property can lead to toxic effects especially when they bind to receptors or enzymes responsible for important physiological functions. Hence, molecules with multiple aromatic rings should be carefully evaluated before being used in therapy.
Rule 3: Molecules with high molecular weight and complex structures often possess poor pharmacokinetic profiles due to their low solubility and permeability across cell membranes. These characteristics make them less desirable candidates for drug development. It is recommended to avoid using large and complex molecules unless necessary because of their increased risk of adverse reactions.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. For example, the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) or a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in a molecule may increase its potential to disrupt the normal functioning of the immune system. Therefore, molecules containing these functional groups should be carefully evaluated for their potential to cause adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule may also play a role in determining its ability to interact with biological targets and cause adverse effects. Molecules that are too large or have a non-optimal shape may have difficulty penetrating cell membranes or binding to target proteins, leading to reduced potency or efficacy. Therefore, molecules that are too large or have a non-optimal shape should be avoided as candidates for drugs targeting the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 3: The presence of certain atoms or bonds in a molecule may also affect its toxicity. For example, the presence of halogen atoms such as chlorine or bromine may increase the molecule's reactivity and enhance its ability to form covalent bonds with biological targets. Additionally, the presence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as pyridine or pyrimidine rings may increase the molecule's potential to act as an electrophile and form adducts with nucleophiles such as DNA or proteins. Therefore, molecules containing these features should be carefully evaluated for their potential to cause adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. For example, the sulfonamide group present in the second molecule may interact with the immune system and lead to adverse reactions. Therefore, molecules containing such groups should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxicity.
Rule 2: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a molecule may also play a role in determining its ability to cross cell membranes and affect cellular processes. Molecules with high molecular weights or hydrophobicities may have difficulty crossing cell membranes and reaching their target sites within cells, which could reduce their potency as drugs. Therefore, these factors should be taken into consideration when designing new drug candidates.
Rule 3: The charge of a molecule at physiological pH can influence its interaction with biological macromolecules and its bioavailability. Neutral molecules tend to have better membrane permeability than charged ones, but they may also have lower affinity for binding targets due to weaker electrostatic interactions. On the other hand, charged molecules may have higher specificity towards their targets but may also face challenges in passing through cell membranes. Therefore, the net charge of a molecule must be considered during drug design to optimize its efficacy and safety profile.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a functional group such as "CC(=O)NSCC1CNN(C(=O)O1)C2=CC(=C(C=C2)N3CCOCC3)F" or "C[C@]12CC[C@H]3[C@H]([C@@H]1CC[C@@H]2O)[C@@H](CC4=C3C=CC(=C4)O)CCCCCCCCCS(=O)CCCC(C(F)(F)F)(F)F", then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a halogen atom like chlorine in its structure, for example "C1=C(C(=C(C(=C1Cl)Cl)CC2=C(C(=CC(=C2Cl)Cl)Cl)O)O)Cl", then it may not have any significant impact on the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 3: If a compound contains metal ions such as sodium and iron in its formula, for instance "C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O)O)O)O)O)O.[Na+].[Fe+3]", then it could potentially lead to adverse reactions in the body due to their toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. For example, the molecule in SMILES string "CC1CC2CCC3C(=C)CC(O3)CCC45CC6C(O4)C7C(O6)C(O5)C8C(O7)CCC(O8)CC(=O)CC9C(CC(C1=C)O2)OC(C9OC)CC(CN)O" contains a cyclic ether group which has been associated with toxicity. Therefore, this molecule may have the potential to cause adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 2: The molecular structure and size may also play a role in determining the potential for adverse effects. For instance, the molecule in SMILES string "C[C@H]([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)O[C@@H]1[C@@H]([C@H]([C@H]([C@H](O1)CO[C@@]2(C[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O2)[C@@H]([C@@H](CO)O)O)NC(=O)CNC(=O)OCCOC)O)C(=O)O)O)O)NC(=O)C" contains a carbamoyl group which is known to be toxic when present in high concentrations. Additionally, the molecule is relatively large and complex, which may increase its likelihood of interacting with biological molecules and causing adverse effects.
Rule 

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to blood and lymphatic system disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) or its derivatives such as esters (-COOR) or amides (-CONR2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to blood and lymphatic system disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. For example, the sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) present in the first SMILES string could be responsible for the observed side-effects. Similarly, the nitro group (-NO2) present in the second SMILES string could also contribute to the toxicity of the compound. Therefore, identifying such functional groups in a molecule could help predict its potential adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 2: The charge and polarity of a molecule can affect its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets. For instance, the negatively charged carboxylate ion (-COO-) present in the third SMILES string could make this molecule more hydrophilic and easier to absorb through the skin or gastrointestinal tract than neutral molecules. This property could potentially lead to systemic exposure and increased risk of adverse effects. On the other hand, positively charged ions like the ammonium ion (-NH3+) found in the fourth SMILES string might hinder the absorption of the molecule due to electrostatic repulsion from the negatively charged cell membrane. Therefore, understanding the charge and polarity of a molecule could provide insights into its pharmacokinetic profile and potential toxic effects.
Rule 3: The three-dimensional structure of a molecule plays a crucial role in determining its bioactivity and potency. For example, the fifth SMILES string contains a thiazole ring which has been shown to have antimicrobial activity. Additionally, the sixth SMILES string features a benzimidazole moiety which is commonly used as a pharmacophore in drug design due to

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a bromine atom attached to a phenyl ring, then it may have side-effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders. The first SMILES string in the dataset contains such a structure and is labeled as having side-effects (label 1).
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, then it may have side-effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders. The second SMILES string in the dataset contains such a structure and is also labeled as having side-effects (label 1).
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group, then it may have side-effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders. The third SMILES string in the dataset contains such a structure and is also labeled as having side-effects (label 1).
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided by this small dataset and should be used cautiously until further research can confirm their validity.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of chlorine atom in the structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. The first three molecules have a chlorine atom present in their structures which indicates potential for causing such effects.
Rule 2: If the molecular formula contains nitrogen atoms, they may also contribute towards adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. The fourth molecule has two nitrogen atoms present in its structure indicating potential for causing such effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains functional groups like carbonyl or carboxylic acid group, it may increase the likelihood of adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. The sixth molecule has both these functional groups present in its structure indicating potential for causing such effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. For example, the molecules containing sulfonamide or nitro groups have been known to cause adverse reactions such as allergic reactions, skin rashes, and liver damage. Therefore, if a molecule contains these functional groups, it should be labeled as having potential side-effects on the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 2: The molecular weight of a compound plays a significant role in determining its biological activity. Generally, smaller molecules tend to be more active than larger ones due to their ability to penetrate cell membranes easily. However, there may be exceptions to this rule depending on the nature of the chemical compounds involved. Therefore, if a molecule has a relatively high molecular weight compared to other similar compounds, it may be considered as potentially harmful to the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 3: The shape and size of a molecule also play important roles in its interaction with biological targets. A molecule with a linear structure may be less likely to cross cell membranes and interact with target proteins inside cells compared to one with a bent or curved structure. Similarly, a molecule with a bulky substituent group may hinder its binding to target proteins by blocking access to the active site. Therefore, if a molecule has a highly flexible or bulky structure, it may be considered as potentially harmful to the blood and lymphatic systems.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of fluorine atom in the structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. The given SMILES strings with labels 1 have fluorine atoms present in their structures while those with labels 0 do not.
Rule 2: If the molecular formula contains nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur atoms, they may also contribute towards causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. The given SMILES strings with labels 1 contain these elements whereas those with labels 0 do not.
Rule 3: If the molecule has a cyclic structure, it may increase its stability but at the same time decrease its reactivity which could potentially reduce its ability to interact with other molecules leading to adverse effects. The given SMILES strings with labels 1 have cyclic structures while those with labels 0 do not.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O) in conjugation with an aromatic ring, then it may have potential side effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. The presence of these functional groups increases the likelihood of binding to proteins involved in regulating blood clotting and immune responses.
Example molecules that match this rule include COC(=O)C(C1=CC=CC=C1Cl)N2CCC3=C(C2)C=CS3 1, CCC(=O)NC[C@@H]1C[C@@H]1C2=C3CCOC3=CC=C2 0, CC(C1CCC(C(O1)OC2C(CC(C(C2O)OC3C(C(C(CO3)(C)O)NC)O)N)N)N)NC 1, C1CCC2=C(C1)C=CC=C2NC3=NCCN3 0, CCS(=O)(=O)C1=CC=C(C=C1)N 1, CCOC(=O)N1C=CN(C1=S)C 1, CC(C1=CC=C(S1)C(=O)C2=CC=CC=C2)C(=O)O 1, CC1=CC(=C(C(=C1NC(=O)CN(CC(=O)O)CC(=O)O)C)Br)C 0, CCCCCCCC(=O)NC(CN1CCCC1)C(C2=CC3=C(C=C2)OCCO3)O

================================

Rule 1: The presence of chlorine atoms in the structure may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule can be applied to molecules such as CC1(N=C(N=C(N1OCCCOC2=CC(=C(C=C2Cl)Cl)Cl)N)N)C.Cl which has three chlorine atoms present in its structure.
Rule 2: The presence of arsenic atoms in the structure may also increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule can be applied to molecules such as [O-2].[O-2].[O-2].[As+3].[As+3] which contains two arsenic atoms in its structure.
Rule 3: The presence of nitrogen atoms in the structure may decrease the likelihood of causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule can be applied to molecules such as C1=CC(=CC=C1C(=O)NCC(=O)O)N which does not contain any nitrogen atom in its structure.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a similar functional group, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems. The presence of this group is known to cause allergic reactions and other types of toxicity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems. Halogen atoms are known to increase the reactivity of molecules and can lead to toxic reactions.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen-containing ring structure such as pyridine or pyrimidine, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems. Nitrogen-containing rings are known to interact with biological molecules and can disrupt normal cellular processes.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of sulfonyl group (SO2R) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule applies to compounds labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, CS(=O)(=O)OCCCCOS(=O)(=O)C has two sulfonyl groups and is labeled as 1.
Rule 2: Compounds containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine at specific positions may have higher chances of causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule applies to compounds labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For instance, CCC(=O)OC1(C(CC2C1(CC(C3(C2CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC43C)F)O)C)C)C(=O)CCl has one chlorine atom and is labeled as 1.
Rule 3: A compound having a nitro group (NO2) attached to an aromatic ring may exhibit adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule applies to compounds labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, C1CC1N2C=C(C(=O)C3=CC(=C(C=C32)N4CCNCC4)F)C(=O)O has a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring and is labeled as 1.

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule applies to molecules 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule applies to molecules 2 and 3.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule applies to molecules 4 and 5.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the provided dataset and may not apply to all cases. It's always best to consult with a qualified chemist before making any conclusions about the safety of a particular compound.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of fluorine in a compound increases its potential for causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule applies to molecules containing the functional group C-F or CF3 attached to any carbon atom. For example, in the first SMILES string, the fluorine atom is present as part of the functional group COCF.
Rule 2: A compound with a carbonyl group (C=O) adjacent to a chlorine atom has a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems than one without such a group. This rule applies to compounds where the two atoms are connected by a single bond. For instance, in the fourth SMILES string, there is a carbonyl group next to a chlorine atom in the structure CCC(=O)OC1(C(CC2C1(CC(C3(C2CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC43C)F)O)C)C)C(=O)CCl.
Rule 3: Molecules with a sulfonamide group (R-SO2-NR'2) have a high probability of causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule applies to compounds where sulfur is bonded to two nitrogen atoms through oxygen bridges. For example, in the twelfth SMILES string, there is a sulfonamide group in the structure CC(C)ON=C(N)N=C(N)Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a benzene ring with one or more chlorine atoms attached, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems. The first example in the dataset contains both these features and has been labeled as having side-effect activity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to two carbon atoms, which are also bonded to each other through another single bond, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems. This feature is present in the second example in the dataset, but it has been labeled as not having side-effect activity.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to four different carbon atoms, at least one of which is also bonded to a hydrogen atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems. This feature is present in the third example in the dataset, which has been labeled as having side-effect activity.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide or nitro group in a compound, then it may have potential side effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. The given SMILES strings with labels 1 contain these functional groups which indicate their possible association with adverse reactions.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings may also exhibit similar side effects if they are substituted with certain functional groups like halogens or amines. This rule applies to the second and third SMILES strings where the compounds contain benzene ring attached to various substituents.
Rule 3: Compounds having polar functional groups like carboxylic acid, hydroxyl, or amino groups may interact with biological molecules leading to toxic effects. The last two SMILES strings with labels 1 possess these types of functionalities indicating their probable involvement in causing toxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to blood and lymphatic system disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure "C1C[C@H](N(C1)C(=O)[C@@H]2CSSC[C@@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N2)CC(=O)N)CCC(=O)N)CC3=CC=CC=C3)CC4=CC=C(C=C4)O)NC(=O)CNC(=O)CNC(=O)CNC(=O)CN)C(=O)N[C@@H](CCCCN)C(=O)NCC(=O)N", then it is likely to have side-effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders. This rule was derived from the first SMILES string provided in the dataset which contains this specific substructure.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure "C(=NNC(=N)N)(N)N", then it is unlikely to have any side-effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders. This rule was derived from the second SMILES string provided in the

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in the blood and lymphatic systems:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have side-effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having such side-effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) adjacent to a double bond or triple bond, it may also have side-effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders. This rule applies to the second and third molecules in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom, it may not have any significant side-effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders. This rule applies to the sixth molecule in the dataset.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided by the given dataset and should be used with caution. Further research and testing would be needed to confirm their validity and applicability to other molecules.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a benzene ring in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule applies to compounds such as CN(C)CCN(CC1=CC=C(C=C1)OC)C2=CC=CC=N2 and C(C(F)(F)F)(OC(F)F)Cl.
Rule 2: Compounds containing sulfur atoms may also increase the risk of adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule applies to compounds such as CCSSSCC(=O)NHP(=O)(OP(=O)(OC1CCCC1)OC1CCCC1)N and CCCS(=O)c1ccc(cc1)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(cc1)OS(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1.
Rule 3: The absence of certain functional groups or elements in a compound may decrease its potential for causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. For example, the absence of chlorine atoms in C(C(F)(F)F)(OC(F)F)Cl and carbon-carbon double bonds in C[C@H]1C(=O)N[C@H]2CSSC[C@H]3C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@@H](CSSC[C@H](NC(=O)CNC(=O)[C@@H](NC2=O)[C@@H](C)O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC4=CC=C(C=C4)O)C(=O)O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CSSC[C@@H](C(=O)N3)N)C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N5CCC[C@H]5C(=O)N1)CC(=O)N)CC6=CC=C(C=C6)O)CCC(=O)O reduces their chances of causing harm to these organs.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as nitro group or fluorine in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems.
Rule 2: A compound containing a conjugated system of double bonds may have a higher probability of exhibiting toxicity towards the blood and lymphatic systems compared to compounds without this feature.
Rule 3: Compounds with a high degree of hydrophobicity tend to accumulate in lipid membranes and may disrupt their normal function leading to adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to blood and lymphatic system disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders. This rule applies to molecules 8, 9, and 10.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders. This rule applies to molecules 11 and 12.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains both a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and a cyano group (-CN), then it may have the potential to cause severe adverse effects related to blood and lymphatic system disorders. This rule applies to molecule 13 only.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide, carboxylic acid, or amide in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. This rule can be applied to compounds 1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems due to their ability to bind to proteins and disrupt normal biological processes. This rule can be applied to compounds 1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a compound's structure may also play a role in determining its potential for causing adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. Longer and more complex structures may have greater flexibility and the ability to interact with multiple targets within the body, increasing the likelihood of off-target interactions and adverse effects. This rule can be applied to all compounds listed above.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a benzene ring in the molecular structure, then it may have potential side effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. The presence of this functional group indicates that the compound has the ability to bind to receptors or enzymes involved in these biological processes. Therefore, molecules containing such groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles before being used as drugs.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group, i.e., R-SO2NH2, it may also exhibit toxicity towards the blood and lymphatic systems. Sulfonamides are known to interfere with folic acid metabolism, which can lead to various health problems including anemia, bone marrow suppression, and megaloblastic anemia. Hence, compounds possessing this moiety must be cautiously considered when designing new drug candidates.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure includes a nitro group, i.e., -NO2, it could potentially trigger allergic reactions and other immune responses. Nitro compounds are often associated with skin irritation, respiratory distress, and even cancer. Therefore, caution should be exercised while using substances containing this functional group.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), then it may have adverse effects on the blood and lymphatic systems. The presence of these functional groups indicates that the compound has the potential to interact with proteins in the body, which could lead to unwanted side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may be associated with adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. Nitro compounds can irritate the skin and mucous membranes, and some studies suggest they may also increase the risk of heart disease.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring, then it may be associated with adverse effects on the immune system. Benzene is known to be carcinogenic, meaning it can cause cancer, and some studies suggest it may also affect the immune system.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to blood and lymphatic system disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (represented by the functional group symbol C=O) followed by a nitrogen atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to blood and lymphatic system disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the first molecule listed in the dataset, CC(=O)NO, satisfies this condition and is labeled as "1" because it is known to cause adverse effects in humans.
