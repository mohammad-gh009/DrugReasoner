Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to vascular disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a benzene ring, then it may have side effects related to vascular disorders. The first example in the dataset meets this criteria, as it contains both a sulfonamide group and a benzene ring.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a pyridine ring, then it may have side effects related to vascular disorders. The second example in the dataset meets this criteria, as it contains both a nitro group and a pyridine ring.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a pyrimidine ring, then it may have side effects related to vascular disorders. The third example in the dataset meets this criteria, as it contains both a carbonyl group and a pyrimidine ring.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the cyano group (-CN) present in the first SMILES string could be associated with toxicity. Similarly, the sulfonyl group (-SO2R) found in the second SMILES string has been linked to allergic reactions and other adverse effects. Therefore, molecules containing these or similar functional groups should be carefully evaluated for potential risks.
Rule 2: The structure of a molecule can also play a role in determining its safety profile. For instance, the third SMILES string contains a nitro group (-NO2) which is known to be toxic and potentially carcinogenic. Additionally, the fourth SMILES string features a carbamate group (-OC(=O)NR1R2) which can undergo hydrolysis under physiological conditions to release toxic compounds such as carbon dioxide and amines. Therefore, molecules containing these or similar structural motifs should be closely monitored for potential hazards.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound can also affect its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets. Molecules with high molecular weights and hydrophobicities tend to have lower bioavailability and higher toxicity than more hydrophilic and smaller molecules. Therefore, these factors should be taken into account when evaluating the safety of new chemical entities.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a gadolinium ion ([Gd+3]) or a barium ion ([Ba+2]), then it is likely to have adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule is based on the fact that these ions are known to cause vascular disorders in some cases.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to two carbon atoms in a linear arrangement, as in CCC(=C)C(=O)C1=C(C(=C(C=C1)OCC(=O)O)Cl)Cl, then it is unlikely to have adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule is based on the observation that this specific structural feature appears only in molecules labeled as having no such effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a benzene ring, as in C6H5CONHC(NH2)CH3, then it is likely to have adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule is based on the fact that nitro groups are known to cause blood vessel constriction and other vascular problems.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom bonded to two carbon atoms in a conjugated system, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule and has been labeled as having the potential to cause such effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a double bond in a conjugated system, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The third molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule and has also been labeled as having the potential to cause such effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbonyl group and a sulfonamide group, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The sixth molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule and has also been labeled as having the potential to cause such effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a barium ion (Ba+2) in its structure, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies only to the first SMILES string provided in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom (F) attached to a carbon atom in the cyclopropane ring, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies only to the second SMILES string provided in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom (N) bonded to two other carbon atoms, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to all molecules except for the third one where there is no such bond present.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The presence of this functional group in certain drugs such as glibenclamide and tolbutamide has been linked to their ability to block ATP-sensitive potassium channels in pancreatic beta cells, leading to insulin secretion and hypoglycemia. However, this rule should be taken with caution since other factors such as dosage, duration of use, and individual patient characteristics also play a role in determining the overall toxicity of a drug.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. Nitro compounds such as nitroglycerin and isosorbide dinitrate are commonly used for treating angina pectoris and heart failure due to their vasodilatory effects on blood vessels. However, these agents can also cause hypotension, headache, and other side effects at higher doses or in susceptible individuals.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. Halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane and chloroform are known to cause central nervous system depression, respiratory depression, and cardiac arrhythmias when inhaled or ingested. These agents can also cause liver damage and other systemic toxicities at high doses.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of chlorine atom in the structure of the molecule, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The first molecule in the given dataset satisfies this rule and has been labeled as having a side-effect activity related to vascular disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group, then it may have a higher chance of causing adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The third molecule in the given dataset satisfies this rule but has been labeled as not having any such side-effects. This suggests that other factors also play a role in determining the likelihood of a molecule causing these types of side-effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group, then it may have a lower chance of causing adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The second molecule in the given dataset does not contain a nitro group but has been labeled as having no side-effects related to vascular disorders. However, further research would be needed to confirm if this rule holds true for all molecules containing nitro groups.

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains iodine atoms, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The presence of iodine in molecules can increase their lipophilicity, which can lead to increased absorption into the bloodstream and potentially harmful interactions with other substances within the body.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains sulfur or selenium atoms, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. Sulfur and selenium are essential elements for many biological processes, so they are often incorporated into drugs and other biologically active compounds. However, excessive exposure to these elements can also be toxic, so it's important to use them judiciously.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains multiple conjugated double bonds, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. Conjugated double bonds can increase the molecule's ability to absorb light energy, which can lead to phototoxicity and other harmful reactions. Additionally, some studies suggest that certain types of conjugated double bonds may interact with proteins and other biomolecules in ways that can disrupt normal cellular functions.

The second molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having the potential to cause such effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-CH=CH-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having the potential to cause such effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on blood vessels. This rule can be applied to compounds 7 and 8 as they both contain this functional group.
Rule 2: Compounds containing conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings have a higher chance of being toxic than those without them. Therefore, compounds 9 and 10 may have a greater risk of causing adverse effects due to their conjugation and planarity.
Rule 3: A compound's molecular weight and hydrophobicity may also play a role in determining its toxicity. Generally, larger molecules tend to be more hydrophobic and less water-soluble, which can make them more likely to interact with cell membranes and cause damage. Compound 1 has a relatively high molecular weight compared to other compounds listed here, making it potentially more harmful.
