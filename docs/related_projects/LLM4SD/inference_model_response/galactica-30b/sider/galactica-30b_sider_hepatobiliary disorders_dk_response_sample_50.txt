Rule 1: The presence of sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in a molecule may increase its potential to cause adverse effects on liver and bile ducts. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the given dataset. For example, the first molecule contains a sulfonamide group and has been reported to have hepatobiliary disorder as one of its side effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing chlorine atoms may also be associated with increased risk of causing adverse effects on liver and bile ducts. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" or "0" in the given dataset. For instance, the third molecule contains two chlorine atoms and has been linked to hepatotoxicity. However, this rule should be used cautiously since other factors such as dose and duration of exposure could also play a role in determining the toxicity of a compound.
Rule 3: The absence of certain functional groups or structural features in a molecule may decrease its likelihood of causing adverse effects on liver and bile ducts. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" in the given dataset. For example, the last molecule does not contain any functional groups commonly found in toxic compounds and has not been reported to have any significant adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the liver or other organs. Therefore, compounds containing these functional groups should be labeled as having high risk of causing hepatotoxicity.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds may have higher probability of being toxic due to their ability to interact with biological molecules through π-π stacking interactions. Therefore, compounds containing these structural features should also be labeled as having high risk of causing toxicity.
Rule 3: Compounds containing metal ions such as sodium, manganese, calcium, lanthanum, or iron may exhibit different chemical reactivity compared to organic compounds without metals. Therefore, the presence of metal ions in a compound may affect its potential for causing adverse effects. However, further research is needed to establish specific structure-activity relationships between metal ion content and toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) or a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule may indicate potential toxicity. Therefore, molecules containing these functional groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule may also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects. Molecules that are too large or have a non-optimal shape may not be able to penetrate cell membranes easily, leading to reduced bioavailability and lower potency. On the other hand, smaller molecules with optimal shapes may be more likely to cross cell membranes and interact with target proteins.
Rule 3: The charge of a molecule may affect its ability to cross cell membranes and reach its target site. Neutral molecules may be more readily absorbed by cells than charged molecules due to their higher lipophilicity. However, positively charged molecules may be more effective at crossing cell membranes and interacting with negatively charged targets such as enzymes or receptors.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a phosphate group in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing hepatobiliary disorders as seen in the first SMILES string labeled as 1. This could be due to the fact that phosphates are commonly found in biological molecules and play important roles in cellular processes such as energy transfer and signal transduction. However, this rule should be used cautiously since other factors such as dosage and individual susceptibility also contribute to the risk of developing adverse effects.
Rule 2: Fluorine-containing groups such as CF3 or C6F5 may decrease the likelihood of a molecule causing adverse effects as seen in the second SMILES string labeled as 0. Fluorine is often used in drug design to modify physical and chemical properties of compounds such as lipophilicity, metabolic stability, and binding affinity. However, fluorine can also affect the conformation and electronic distribution of a molecule, which can impact its bioactivity and toxicity. Therefore, the exact nature and position of fluorinated substituents need to be carefully considered when predicting their potential effects on safety and efficacy.
Rule 3: The absence of certain functional groups such as sulfonyl or carbonyl groups may reduce the likelihood of a molecule causing adverse effects as seen in the third SMILES string labeled as 0. These groups are often associated with toxicity and reactivity, so their absence may indicate a more favorable safety profile. However, these rules should still be applied with caution since there may be exceptions and other structural features that can influence toxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a Gd atom and its SMILES string ends with "0", then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule suggests that molecules containing gadolinium ions may have some level of toxicity towards the liver or bile ducts. However, this rule should be taken with caution as there may be other factors involved in causing such adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and its SMILES string starts with "C[C@@]1(..." followed by a bracketed expression that includes the structure of the molecule, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule suggests that molecules containing nitro groups may have some level of toxicity towards the liver or bile ducts. Again, this rule should be taken with caution as there may be other factors involved in causing such adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) and its SMILES string begins with "S(=O)(=O)", then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule suggests that molecules containing sulfonyl groups may have some level of toxicity towards the liver or bile ducts. Once again, this rule should be taken with caution as there may be other factors involved in causing such adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a chlorine atom present in the structure of the molecule and if its position is such that it forms a double bond with another carbon atom or a triple bond with one nitrogen atom then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects on the liver. The presence of this halogen may disrupt the normal functioning of the liver cells leading to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 1

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and a benzene ring, then it has a high probability of causing hepatobiliary disorders as indicated by the first SMILES string labeled as 1 in the given dataset. This rule suggests that molecules containing these functional groups may have a higher likelihood of exhibiting this type of toxicity.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a furan ring and a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it also has a high probability of causing hepatobiliary disorders as shown by the second SMILES string labeled as 1 in the dataset. This rule suggests that molecules containing these structural features may be more likely to exhibit this type of toxicity.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a nitrogen atom, then it does not have a high probability of causing hepatobiliary disorders as demonstrated by the third SMILES string labeled as 0 in the dataset. This rule suggests that molecules without this specific structural feature may be less likely to exhibit this type of toxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom and a chlorine atom connected to a benzene ring, then it is likely to have side-effects associated with hepatobiliary disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset meet this criterion and have labels of 1, indicating they do have such side-effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group attached to a cyclopropane ring, then it may have side-effects associated with hepatobiliary disorders. The third molecule in the dataset meets this criterion but does not have any information about its side-effects, so we cannot make a prediction based on this rule alone.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group, then it may have side-effects associated with hepatobiliary disorders. The last four molecules in the dataset contain nitro groups and all have labels of 0, indicating they do not have such side-effects. However, it's important to note that these rules are just educated guesses based on the limited information provided by the dataset and should not be relied upon as absolute predictors without further testing.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group and a carboxylic acid group, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in relation to liver damage or dysfunction. The given SMILES string CC1=NNC(=C1SCC(=O)O)C2=CC=C(C=C2)C(=O)O matches this rule.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have a potential for causing adverse effects such as mutagenicity or carcinogenicity. The given SMILES string C1=CNN(C(=O)C2=C(C=C3C(=O)C(=CDE)C(=D)CE3)B(F)G)C(=A)B1 matches this rule.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a halogen atom such as chlorine, then it may have a potential for causing adverse effects due to its ability to react with other molecules in the body. The given SMILES string COC(=O)ccc(c(=O)n1ccccc1Br)Br matches this rule.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule applies to molecules such as CN1CCOC(C2=CC=CC=C2C1)C3=CC=CC=C3 and CCC#CC(C)C1(C(=O)NC(=O)N(C1=O)C)CC=C.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a phenyl ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule applies to molecules such as CC(=O)O[C@H]1CC2=CC=CC=C2N(C3=CC=CC=C13)C(=O)N 1.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a conjugated system consisting of a carbonyl group (>C=O) and an alkene group (-C=C-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule applies to molecules such as C1=CC(=CC=C1COC(CN2C=CN=C2)C3=C(C=C(C=C3)Cl)Cl)Cl and COC1=C2C(=CC(=C1N3CC4CCCNC4C3)F)C(=O)C(=CN2C5CC5)C(=O)O 1.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and a fluorine atom (-F), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The first example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains both these functional groups.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a conjugated system of double bonds, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The second example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains both these functional groups.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbamate group (-O-CO-NR2) and a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The third example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains both these functional groups.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in compound #9 and a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in compounds #7 and #8 suggest potential toxicity.
Rule 2: The length and complexity of a molecule may also affect its ability to cause adverse effects. Compounds #1, #2, and #3 have relatively simple structures compared to other molecules in the dataset, which may explain their lack of reported hepatotoxicity.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule may play a role in determining its biological activity. Compound #1 has a chiral center at C10, but no information about the configuration was provided in the dataset. Therefore, it is difficult to draw any conclusions regarding the impact of stereochemistry on the observed bioactivity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a similar functional group, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The presence of this group in some drugs such as sulfamethoxazole and sulfasalazine has been linked to liver toxicity. Therefore, molecules containing this group should be carefully evaluated for their potential to cause these types of adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. Nitro compounds such as acetaminophen and nitrofurantoin have been associated with liver damage and other adverse effects. Therefore, molecules containing this group should also be carefully evaluated for their potential to cause these types of adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. Halogen atoms can affect the chemical and physical properties of a molecule, which can impact its biological activity. Some studies have suggested that certain halogenated hydrocarbons such as trichloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride can cause liver damage and other adverse effects. Therefore, molecules containing halogen atoms should also be carefully evaluated for their potential to cause these types of adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a guanidine group (-C(NH2)=NNHC(=O)) or a urea group (-CONH-CO-) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The second example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a guanidine group.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The third example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a nitro group.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:

Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group attached to a phenyl ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings "[H+].[H+].CCOC1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@H](CN(CCN(CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])N(CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-].[Gd+3]" and "CC(=O)CCC1=CC2=C(C=C1)C=C(C=C2)OC".

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom and a sulfonamide group, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The first example in the dataset meets this rule.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group and a conjugated double bond system, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The second example in the dataset meets this rule.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and a nitrile group, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The third example in the dataset meets this rule.
Note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the dataset and should be treated as preliminary until further validation is conducted.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, then it may have potential side effects on liver function. The given SMILES string for CCC(=O)OC(C(C)C)OP(=O)(CCCCC1=CC=CC=C1)CC(=O)N2CC(CC2C(=O)[O-])C3CCCCC3 does contain both these groups, so it should be labeled as having potential side effects on liver function.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a guanidine group (-C(=NH2)NR2R3) and a chlorinated carbohydrate moiety (-CHClO-), then it may also have potential side effects on liver function. The given SMILES string C=CCN.C1C(O1)CCl does contain both these groups, so it should also be labeled as having potential side effects on liver function.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a phosphine oxide group (-P(=O)RR') and a conjugated system of double bonds, then it may have potential side effects on skin irritation. The given SMILES strings CC[C@H](C)[C@H]1C(=O)N[C@H]2CSSC[C@@H](C(=O)N[C@@H](CSSC[C@@H](C(=O)NCC(=O)N[C@H](C(=O

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a compound may increase its potential for causing liver damage and other adverse effects on the hepatobiliary system. This rule applies to compounds with the structure CCC1=NN(C(=O)N1CCOC2=CC=CC=C2)CCCN3CCN(CC3)C4=CC(=CC=C4)Cl or C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(C2=CC=CC=C2)S(=O)CC(=O)N.
Rule 2: Compounds containing a peptide bond between two amino acids have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on the hepatobiliary system than those without such bonds. This rule applies to compounds with the structure CC(C)CC(C(=O)NC(C(C)C)C(=O)O)NC(=O)CNC(=O)C(CCC(=O)N)NC(=O)C(CC(C)C)NC(=O)C(CC(C)C)NC(=O)C(CCCNC(=N)N)NC(=O)C(CCC(=O)N)NC(=O)C(CC(C)C)NC(=O)C(CCCNC(=N)N)NC(=O)C(C)NC(=O)C(CO)NC(=O)C(CC(=O)O)NC(=O)C(CCCNC(=N)N)NC(=O)C(CC(C)C)NC(=O)C(CCCNC(=N)N)NC(=O)C(CO)NC(=O)C(CC(C)C)NC(=O)C(CCC(=O)O)NC(=O)C(CO)NC(=O)C(C(C)O)NC(=O)C(CC1=CC=CC=C1)NC(=O)C(C(C)O)NC(=O)CNC(=O)C(CC(=O)O)NC(=O)C(CO)NC(=O)C(CC2=NC=CN2)N.
Rule 3: Aromatic rings in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the hepatobiliary system due to their ability to bind to proteins and disrupt normal cellular processes. This rule applies to compounds with the structure C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(C2=CC=CC=C2)S(=O)CC(=O)N or COC(=O)NC1=NC2=C(N1)C=C(C=C2)C(=O)C3=CC=CC=C3.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure "C1=CC=C2C(=C1)C(=NO2)CS(=O)(=O)N" or "C[N+]1(CCC2=CC(=C(C=C2[C@H]1CC3=CC(=C(C(=C3)OC)OC)OC)OC)OC)CCCOC(=O)CCC=CCCC(=O)OCCC[N+]4(CCC5=CC(=C(C=C5[C@H]4CC6=CC(=C(C(=C6)OC)OC)OC)OC)OC)C", then it is likely to have side-effects related to hepatobiliary disorders.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a fluorine atom and a biphenyl group connected by a carbonyl group, then it may have potential side effects on liver function. The first two compounds in the given dataset contain this structural feature and they both have been labeled as having potential side effects on liver function.
Rule 2: If a compound has a cyano group attached to a cyclohexane ring, then it may also have potential side effects on liver function. The third compound in the given dataset contains this structural feature but it has been labeled as not having any potential side effects on liver function. This suggests that there may be other factors involved in determining if a compound has such side effects.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group, then it may have potential side effects on kidney function. The fourth compound in the given dataset contains this structural feature and it has been labeled as having potential side effects on kidney function.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a halogen atom in a molecule increases its potential for causing adverse effects on the liver and bile ducts.

Rule 2: A molecule containing a carboxylic acid group attached to an aromatic ring may have a higher risk of causing adverse effects on the liver and bile ducts if it also contains other functional groups or atoms that increase its lipophilicity. For example, CCC(C1=CC=CC=C1)C(=O)O 1 has both a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring, which could contribute to its toxicity.
Rule 3: Molecules containing certain functional groups or atoms may be more likely to cause adverse effects on the liver and bile ducts regardless of their structure. For instance, molecules containing sulfur or nitrogen atoms may have a greater chance of interacting with biological systems and causing harm.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure "CC(=O)*CC**NN1C(=O)C2=C(N=CNN2C)N(C1=O)C" where "*" and "**" represent any non-hydrogen atom or group of atoms, then it is likely to have side-effect activity related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule covers molecules like the first one in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure "***CC(C1=CC(=C(C=C1)O)O)OR" where "***" represents any non-hydrogen atom or group of atoms, then it is unlikely to have side-effect activity related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule covers molecules like the second one in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains the substructure "****CC(COC1=CC=CC=C1)N(CCX)CCY" where "****" represents any non-hydrogen atom or group of atoms and X and Y are either Cl or H, then it is likely to have side-effect activity related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule covers molecules like the fifth one in the dataset.
Note that these rules are based on observations from the provided dataset and

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) and a fluorine atom (-F), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The first example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains both these functional groups.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a chlorine atom (-Cl), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The third example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains only one carbon-oxygen double bond but no sulfur or nitrogen atoms.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (-C6H5) and a cyano group (-CN), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The fifth example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a phenyl group (-C6H5) and a nitrile group (-CN).

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as a carboxylic acid or its derivatives, it may lead to hepatotoxicity and other liver-related issues. The presence of these groups increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects in the body. For example, molecules like "CC1=C(C(=O)N2CCCCC2=N1)CCN3CCC(CC3)C4=NOC5=C4C=CC(=C5)F 1" contain a carboxylic acid group which may contribute to their toxicity.
Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic rings may also increase the risk of adverse effects due to their ability to interact with biological systems. For instance, molecules like "C1=CC=C(C=C1)COC2=CC=C(C=C2)O 0" have two benzene rings which may affect their pharmacokinetic profile.
Rule 3: A molecule's size and shape may play a role in determining its potential for adverse effects. Large and complex structures may be more likely to interact with biological targets and disrupt normal cellular processes. For example, molecules like "CCCC1OC2CC3C4CCC5=CC(=O)C=CC5(C4C(CC3(C2(O1)C(=O)CO)C)O)C 0" have a large and complex structure which may make them more toxic than smaller molecules.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as "-CN" or "-NO2" and has a positive charge on its nitrogen atom, then it may have potential hepatotoxicity. This rule applies to molecules in rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71,

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as halogen atoms and nitro groups in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the liver or other organs. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, CON=C1CN(CC1CN)C2=C(C=C3C(=O)C(=CN(C3=N2)C4CC4)C(=O)O)F 1 contains a fluorine atom which may contribute to its hepatobiliary disorder activity.
Rule 2: The presence of certain structural features such as conjugated double bonds and aromatic rings in a molecule may also increase its potential for causing adverse effects. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For instance, C1=CC(=CC=C1CCC2=CNC3=C2C(=O)N=C(N3)N)C(=O)N[C@H](CCC(=O)O)C(=O)O 1 has a conjugated system of double bonds which may contribute to its hepatobiliary disorder activity.
Rule 3: The absence of specific functional groups or structural features in a molecule may decrease its potential for causing adverse effects. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 0 in the given dataset. For example, CCCCCCCCCC(=O)N[C@@H]1[C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O[C@H]1OC2=C3C=C4C=C2OC5=C(C=C(C=C5)[C@H]([C@H]6C(=O)N[C@H](C7=CC(=CC(=C7C8=C(C=CC(=C8)[C@H](C(=O)N6)NC(=O)[C@@H]4NC(=O)[C@@H]9C1=CC(=CC(=C1)O)OC1=C(C=CC(=C1)[C@@H](C(=O)N[C@H](CC1=CC(=C(O3)C=C1)

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amides and sulfonamides in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the liver or other organs.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to bind to enzymes and receptors in the body, which can lead to disruption of normal cellular processes and ultimately result in toxicity.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings and halogen atoms may also be more likely to cause adverse effects due to their chemical reactivity and stability.
Explanation: Aromatic rings are known to be chemically stable and can interact with biological molecules through π-π stacking interactions, leading to potential toxicity. Halogen atoms, particularly chlorine and bromine, can also enhance the chemical reactivity of compounds by increasing their electrophilic nature.
Rule 3: Molecules with a high degree of symmetry and complexity may also pose a higher risk of causing adverse effects due to their increased likelihood of interacting with biological targets.
Explanation: Symmetric structures often possess multiple binding sites that can facilitate interaction with biological macromolecules, while complex molecular architectures can hinder their metabolism and excretion from the body.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels of 1, indicating that they do have this potential.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule is based on the fact that many drugs containing such a functional group have been associated with liver toxicity. The third molecule in the dataset contains this motif and it has a label of 1, supporting this hypothesis.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen-containing ring structure, such as a pyridine or pyrimidine ring, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The last four molecules in the dataset all contain such rings and they all have labels of either 1 or 0, suggesting that this is a relevant factor for predicting hepatotoxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The first example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains both a sulfonamide group and a benzene ring.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a conjugated system of double bonds, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The second example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains both a cyano group and a conjugated system of double bonds.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a halogen atom such as fluorine or chlorine, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The third example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a carbonyl group and a fluorine atom.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as nitro groups and sulfonyl groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the liver or other organs.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to cause toxicity by interfering with normal cellular processes and inducing oxidative stress. They can also bind to proteins and enzymes, leading to their dysfunction and potentially harmful reactions within the body.
Rule 2: A compound containing multiple aromatic rings may be more likely to cause adverse effects due to its ability to interact with biological molecules through π-π stacking interactions.
Explanation: Aromatic rings are planar and can form strong intermolecular forces with other aromatic systems, which can affect the stability and function of biomolecules like DNA and proteins. This can lead to toxic effects such as mutagenicity and carcinogenicity.
Rule 3: Compounds with high molecular weight and complex structures may have increased potential for causing adverse effects due to their low solubility and poor absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.
Explanation: High molecular weight compounds tend to have lower solubility in water, making them less bioavailable when taken orally. Additionally, they may require specialized transport mechanisms or metabolic transformations before they can reach their target sites in the body. These factors can limit their therapeutic efficacy and increase the risk of adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a five-membered ring with two nitrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in relation to hepatobiliary disorders. The first molecule in the given dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a five-membered ring with two nitrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Therefore, we can assign the label "1" for this molecule indicating its potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a six-membered ring with alternating carbon and nitrogen atoms, then it may have a low probability of causing adverse effects in relation to hepatobiliary disorders. The second molecule in the given dataset satisfies this rule but does not contain any oxygen atoms. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive prediction about its potential to cause adverse effects based on this rule alone. We need more information or analysis to determine if this molecule should be labeled as "1" or "0".
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring with a sulfonyl group attached to it, then it has a moderate probability of causing adverse effects in relation to hepatobiliary disorders. The fourth molecule in the given dataset satisfies this rule and also contains a chlorine atom which may increase its toxicity. Therefore, we can assign the label "1" for this molecule indicating its potential to cause adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a bromine atom and a benzene ring, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in relation to hepatobiliary disorders. The presence of these two features together may increase the likelihood of the compound interacting with biological molecules or disrupting normal cellular processes.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a carboxylic acid group attached to a carbon chain, then it has a low probability of causing adverse effects in relation to hepatobiliary disorders. Carboxylic acids are commonly found in natural products and are often considered safe for human consumption.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group, then it has a moderate probability of causing adverse effects in relation to hepatobiliary disorders. Sulfonamides are known to have adverse effects on the liver and other organs, but their exact mechanisms of action are not fully understood.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of halogen atoms in a compound increases its potential for causing adverse effects on the liver and bile ducts.

Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The second example in the dataset contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom next to a carbonyl group and is labeled as having the potential to cause such effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds between two aromatic rings, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The third example in the dataset contains a benzene ring connected to another benzene ring through a double bond and is labeled as having the potential to cause such effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels indicating their association with hepatobiliary disorders.

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have side-effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The first example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains both groups.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a conjugated system consisting of two double bonds separated by one single bond or less, then it may have side-effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule applies to the second and third examples in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a hydroxyl group (-OH), then it may have side-effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule applies to the sixth example in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like "-CN" or "-NO2" in the structure of a molecule, then it may lead to potential toxicity and adverse effects on the body. The given SMILES strings containing such groups should be labeled as 1 for causing hepatotoxicity disorder.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a heterocyclic ring system, especially those having nitrogen atoms, it may increase the chances of toxic effects due to their high reactivity towards different biological systems. Therefore, molecules possessing these types of rings should also be considered potentially harmful and assigned label 1.
Rule 3: Molecules containing halogen atoms like chlorine, fluorine etc. have been reported to exhibit various toxicological effects including liver damage, skin irritation, respiratory problems, and neurological disorders. Hence, compounds bearing halogens must be carefully evaluated before being used in any pharmaceutical formulations.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The first example in the dataset satisfies this rule.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The second example in the dataset violates this rule.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a conjugated system of double bonds, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The third example in the dataset satisfies this rule.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as "-COOH" or "-OH", then it may lead to hepatotoxicity and other liver-related issues. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, the SMILES string CCC(C)[C@@H]1[C@H](CC[C@@]2(O1)CC3C[C@H](O2)C/C=C(/[C@H]([C@H](/C=C/C=C/4\CO[C@H]5[C@@]4([C@@H](C=C([C@H]5O)C)C(=O)O3)O)C)O[C@H]6C[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O6)C)OC7C[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O7)C)O)OC)OC)\C)C.C[C@H]1CC[C@]2(CC3C[C@H](O2)C/C=C(/[C@H]([C@H](/C=C/C=C/4\CO[C@H]5[C@@]4([C@@H](C=C([C@H]5O)C)C(

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a benzimidazole ring and a sulfonamide group, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The first example in the dataset meets this rule.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The second example in the dataset meets this rule.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. However, it's important to note that this rule should only be used as a general guideline and not as a definitive predictor. The third example in the dataset meets this rule but does not necessarily indicate that the molecule will cause adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a compound may indicate its potential to cause liver damage and other adverse effects on the hepatobiliary system. Therefore, compounds containing this functional group should be labeled as having a high risk for causing such adverse effects.
Rule 2: Compounds containing a nitro group or a halogen atom like chlorine or fluorine attached to an aromatic ring may have a higher chance of causing adverse effects due to their ability to interact with biological molecules through covalent bonding. Therefore, these types of compounds should also be labeled as having a high risk for causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with a molecular weight greater than 500 Daltons tend to have lower bioavailability and higher toxicity compared to smaller molecules. Therefore, compounds with a large size should be labeled as having a low risk for causing adverse effects unless they contain specific functional groups that increase their likelihood of causing harm.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as sulfonamide or nitro group, it may lead to adverse effects on the liver and kidneys. The presence of these groups increases the chances of toxicity in the body. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: Molecules having a high degree of conjugation between pi bonds may also increase the risk of toxicity due to their ability to bind to proteins and enzymes. Such compounds should be carefully evaluated for potential adverse effects.
Rule 3: Compounds containing metal ions such as iron or calcium may have toxic effects on the body depending on their concentration and exposure time. These metals can interfere with various metabolic processes and cause damage to cells. Therefore, it is important to monitor the use of such substances and avoid excessive intake.
