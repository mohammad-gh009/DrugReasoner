Rule 1: If a compound contains a functional group such as "-COOH" or "-OH", it may have potential for causing adverse effects on respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule can be applied to compounds in rows 1, 6, 7, and 9 of the given dataset.
Rule 2: If a compound has a long carbon chain structure, it may also have potential for causing adverse effects on these organs. This rule can be applied to row 8 of the dataset.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may not have any significant impact on respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule can be applied to row 3 of the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. For example, the molecule CN(C1=C(N=C(N=C1N)C2=NN(C3=C2C=CC=N3)CC4=CC=CC=C4F)N)C(=O)OC contains a nitro group (-NO2) which is known for its toxic and carcinogenic properties. This suggests that this molecule has a higher chance of causing adverse effects compared to molecules without such functional groups.
Rule 2: The molecular structure and geometry play a crucial role in determining the potential adverse effects of a molecule. For instance, the molecule C1CN=C(N1)NC2=C(C=CC3=NSN=C32)Cl contains a chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring. Chlorine is a highly reactive element and can interact with other molecules in the body, leading to adverse health effects. Therefore, this molecule should be carefully evaluated for any potential risks associated with its use.
Rule 3: The charge state of a molecule can also affect its ability to cause adverse effects. For example, the molecule CC1=CN=C(C(=C1OC)C)CS(=O)C2=NC3=C([N-]2)C=CC(=C3)OC.CC1=CN=C(C(=C1OC)C)CS(=O)C2=NC3=C([N-]2)C=CC(=C3)OC.[Mg+2] contains a magnesium ion (Mg+2) which can alter the electronic configuration and reactivity of

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as cyanide or fluoride, then it may have adverse effects on respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. The presence of these groups in the chemical compound indicates its potential toxicity towards living organisms including humans. Therefore, it is important to consider the structural features of molecules while predicting their biological activities.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure has a conjugated system consisting of multiple double bonds, then it may also exhibit toxic effects due to its ability to absorb light energy and generate reactive oxygen species. This property makes them potent photosensitizers which can damage cellular components upon exposure to sunlight.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains aromatic rings, then it may be associated with adverse health effects because they are known to interact with proteins and enzymes in the body. These interactions can lead to various types of toxicities depending on the nature of the compounds and the exposed tissues.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a functional group such as "-Cl" or "-Br" in the molecular structure, then it may lead to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. The presence of these groups increases the lipophilicity of the compound which enhances its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets leading to toxicity.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also contribute to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders due to its high reactivity and potential for oxidative stress. Nitro compounds have been shown to induce inflammation and tissue damage through the generation of reactive oxygen species.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure has a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it may increase the risk of respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase enzymes involved in regulating acid-base balance and electrolyte transport. Sulfonamides can also bind to serum proteins and disrupt normal metabolic processes.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a phosphorus atom bonded to four oxygen atoms in a cyclic structure, then it may have the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset meet this criterion and have labels of 1, indicating they do have the potential to cause these disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom in a polycyclic ring system, then it may also have the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. The third molecule in the dataset meets this criterion and has a label of 1, indicating it does have the potential to cause these disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a gadolinium ion or a sodium ion, then it may also have the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. However, since only one molecule in the dataset contains either of these ions, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about their relationship to these disorders without more data.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of any functional group such as -COOH or -CHO in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. The given SMILES strings containing these groups have been labeled as 1 which indicates their potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also lead to adverse effects on respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. The given SMILES string containing this group has been labeled as 1 which confirms its potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a metal ion such as Fe or Zn, then it does not seem to be directly related to adverse effects on respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. The given SMILES strings containing these ions have been labeled as 0 which indicates no potential for causing adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a carbonyl group (COR) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1CS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(cc2)n1, CC(C)C(C(=O)OS(=O)(=O)C1SCC(C)C(C)C1)ON1CCOCC1, COC(=O)Nc1nc(C)s(C)sc1, CCCOc1ccccc1SSc1nncn1, O=C(Cn1nc(C)s(C)Sc1)NNC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1, OC(=O)C(C)(C)C(C(=O)OP(=O)(OC2OCCO2)OC2OCCO2)(C)C, c1ccc(cc1Br)C(C)(C)C(=O)NCCSNa+, CN(C)C(=O)C(C)(C)C(=O)OCCOCP(=O)(OC1OCCO1)OC1OCCO1, CNC(=O)C

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a urea group (-CONH2), then it may have the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 15, 16 respectively in the dataset.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. The presence of this functional group in certain drugs such as sulfonamides and sulfonylureas has been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular toxicity. Therefore, molecules containing this group should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. Nitro compounds are known to cause methemoglobinemia, which can lead to cyanosis and other serious health problems. Therefore, molecules containing this group should also be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) attached to an aromatic ring, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. Halogenated aromatics such as chlorobenzene and fluorobenzene have been shown to cause lung damage and other respiratory complications. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should also be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a compound increases its likelihood of causing respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings starting with "SO2NH" or "SNH". For example, the first compound listed has this functional group and is labeled as having a side-effect activity related to these disorders. On the other hand, the second compound does not have this group and is labeled as not having such an activity.
Rule 2: A compound containing a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring may be more likely to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings starting with "C1=CC=C(C=C1)NO2" or "C1=NN=C(C=C1)O2". For instance, the third compound listed has this functional group and is labeled as having a side-effect activity related to these disorders. However, the fourth compound does not have this group but still causes similar effects due to another structural feature.
Rule 3: A compound with a carboxylic acid group conjugated to an alkene may be less likely to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings ending with "Cc1ccc(cc1)Oc2ccccc2COOH" or "Cc1ccc(cc1)Nc2ccccc2CONHC(=O)C". For example, the fifth compound listed has this structure and is labeled as not

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carboxylic acid or its derivatives, nitro compounds, amines, and halogenated hydrocarbons may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects in the respiratory system.
Rule 2: The molecular weight and lipophilicity of the compound also play a role in determining its potential for adverse effects on the respiratory system. Compounds with high molecular weights and lipophilicities tend to accumulate in the lungs and may cause irritation or inflammation.
Rule 3: The shape and size of the molecule may also affect its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets. For example, molecules with linear shapes and small sizes may be more likely to penetrate the lung tissue and cause adverse effects compared to larger and more complex structures.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains fluorine atoms or chlorine atoms, then it has a high probability of causing respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders as these elements have strong electronegativity and can affect the chemical structure and function of molecules. Therefore, compounds containing such atoms should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxicity.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings may also exhibit toxic effects on the respiratory system due to their ability to bind to proteins in the body. Therefore, they should also be closely monitored during drug development processes.
Rule 3: The presence of certain functional groups such as sulfonyl groups, nitro groups, and carbonyl groups can increase the likelihood of a compound exhibiting toxic effects on the respiratory tract. These groups can alter the electronic configuration of the molecule and affect its reactivity and stability. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the selection of such moieties when designing new drugs.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine attached to a benzene ring, then it may have potential side effects on respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. The presence of these atoms in the chemical structure increases its lipophilicity which allows it to cross cell membranes more easily leading to toxic effects.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure has a carbonyl group (C=O) present in the backbone chain, then it may also have potential side effects on respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. Carbonyl groups increase the polarity of molecules making them more reactive towards other compounds. This reactivity can lead to unwanted interactions within cells causing toxicity.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a nitrogen-containing functional group such as an amide or imine group, then it may be associated with potential side effects on respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. Nitrogen-containing functional groups can interact with biological systems through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions leading to changes in protein function and cellular processes.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of bromine atom in the structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on respiratory system. The first two molecules have bromine atoms present in their structures which may be responsible for causing such adverse effects.
Rule 2: If there is a presence of negatively charged ions like Ca^2+ or K+ in the structure, then it may also lead to adverse effects on respiratory system. The fourth molecule has calcium ion present in its structure which may be responsible for causing such adverse effects.
Rule 3: If there is a presence of sulfur atom in the structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on cardiovascular system. The seventh molecule has sulfur atom present in its structure which may be responsible for causing such adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional groups such as nitro group or halogen group in the structure of the molecule, then it may lead to adverse effects on respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. The given SMILES strings with labels 1 have these functional groups present in their structures.
Rule 2: If the molecular weight of the compound is greater than 500 Daltons, then it may also lead to adverse effects on respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. The given SMILES string with label 1 has a molecular weight of 656 Da which satisfies this rule.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring or other aromatic rings, then it may increase the risk of adverse effects on respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders due to its lipophilic nature. However, this rule cannot be generalized as some molecules containing aromatic rings do not show any adverse effects. The given SMILES string with label 0 does not contain any aromatic rings but still shows no adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to a six-membered ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders. The presence of fluorine in a compound can affect its physical and chemical properties, including its reactivity and metabolic stability. Fluorine is also known to increase lipophilicity, which can lead to increased absorption through biological membranes and potentially toxic effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a five-membered ring with two double bonds, one of them being conjugated with another double bond or a carbonyl group, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders. This type of structural motif is commonly found in many toxic compounds, such as acrolein and crotonaldehyde. These compounds are highly reactive and can form covalent adducts with proteins and other macromolecules, leading to cellular damage and toxicity.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide functional group, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders. Sulfonamides are a class of antibiotics that inhibit bacterial growth by blocking the production of folic acid, an essential nutrient for cell division. However, some sulfonamides have been associated with idiosyncratic reactions, such as hypersensitivity syndrome and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which can involve multiple organ systems, including the lungs, heart, and skin.

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to each of the four carbon atoms in a chain, then it does not have the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies to the second SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 0.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sodium ion and two phosphate ions, then it does not have the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies to the third SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 0.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the dataset and should be used cautiously until further research is conducted.

Rule 2: If there is a presence of carbonyl group (C=O) in the structure of the molecule, then it may also have potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders as a side effect. The second SMILES string has a carbonyl group present which supports this rule.
Rule 3: If there is a presence of sulfonyl group (SO2R) or phosphate group (PO4R) in the structure of the molecule, then it may be toxic and can potentially cause adverse effects including respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. However, none of the given SMILES strings contain these groups so this rule does not apply here.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as aldehydes or ketones in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the respiratory system. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the given dataset. For example, the first molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) which could potentially contribute to this type of toxicity.
Rule 2: The presence of aromatic rings in a compound may also increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the respiratory system.

For instance, the second molecule has two aromatic rings (C1CC2=CC=CC=C2N1NC(=O)C3=CC(=C(C=C3)Cl)S(=O)(=O)N) which could contribute to this type of toxicity.
Rule 3: The presence of charged groups such as ammonium ions (-NR3+) or carboxylate anions (-COO-) in a compound may decrease its potential for causing adverse effects on the respiratory system. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" in the given dataset. For example, the last molecule has a negatively charged carboxylate anion (-COO-) which could reduce its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets.

Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom (represented by the SMILES string F), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies to one molecule represented by the sixth SMILES string in the dataset.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the given dataset and should be used as a starting point for further analysis rather than definitive conclusions.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl (-SO2-) or carbonyl (-C=O) in a compound may increase its potential for causing respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings CS(=O)C 0 and CCC(=O)OCC(=O)C1(C(CC2C1(CC(C3C2C(CC4=CC(=O)C=CC34C)Cl)O)C)C)OC(=O)CC 0.
Rule 2: Compounds containing negatively charged ions like phosphate (-PO4^2-) or carboxylate (-COO-) may have higher chances of causing respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders due to their ability to cross cell membranes more easily than neutral molecules. This rule applies to compounds C(CN)C(O)(P(=O)(O)[O-])P(=O)(O)[O-].[Na+].[Na+] 1 and CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCCN1CCN(CC1)CCCN2C3=CC=CC=C3SC4=C2C=C(C=C4)C(F)(F)F 1.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have potential side effects on respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders. The presence of this functional group in the chemical compound indicates its ability to irritate the lungs or airways, leading to inflammation and other health problems. Therefore, molecules containing such groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles before being used as drugs or chemicals.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it may also have potential side effects on these organs due to its ability to irritate the skin and mucous membranes. This functional group can react with proteins and enzymes in the body, causing allergic reactions and other health issues. Hence, compounds possessing this moiety must undergo thorough testing to ensure their safe use.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure has a chlorine atom attached to an aromatic ring, it may increase the risk of adverse effects on respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal tissues. Chlorine is known to be toxic and can disrupt normal cell functions if present in high concentrations. Therefore, molecules bearing this substituent should be cautiously considered when designing new drug candidates or chemicals.

Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies to molecules 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (-C=O) through a single bond, then it may have the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies to molecules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl) bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have the potential to cause

================================

Rule 1: The presence of negatively charged ions such as [Ca+2] in the molecular structure may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects on respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies to the first SMILES string where the presence of calcium ion increases the chance of having adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of functional groups like carbonyl group (C=O) or carboxyl group (COOH) in the molecular structure may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects on respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies to the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth, twenty-first, and twenty-second SMILES strings where these functional groups are present which increases the chances of having adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of aromatic rings in the molecular structure may also increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects on respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies to the tenth SMILES string where there is an aromatic ring present which increases the risk of having adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (represented by the SMILES string C1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=C(OC(=N2)CCC(=O)O)C3=CC=CC=C3 1 in the dataset), then it may have the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a guanidine group (represented by the SMILES string CC1CN=C(N1)NC2=C(C=C(C=C2Cl)N)Cl 1 in the dataset), then it may have the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a succinimide group (represented by the SMILES string CCC(C)N1C(=O)N(C=N1)C2=CC=C(C=C2)N3CCN(CC3)C4=CC=C(C=C4)OCC5COC(O5)(CN6C=NC=N6)C7=C(C=C(C=C7)Cl)Cl 1 in the dataset), then it may have the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.


================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as -CN, -COOH, -SO3H, etc. in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal systems.
Rule 2: A molecule containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also have higher chances of exhibiting adverse effects on these systems due to their ability to interact with biological membranes and proteins.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure may also play a role in determining its toxicity. Longer chains and more complex structures may make it harder for the body to break down and eliminate the compound, leading to accumulation and potential harm.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels of 1, indicating their association with the adverse effect.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F) in its structure, then it may also have the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. The third and fifth molecules in the dataset contain Cl and F atoms respectively, and they both have labels of 1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. The seventh molecule in the dataset contains this group and it has a label of 1.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a bromine atom attached to a phenyl ring, then it may have the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies to the first SMILES string in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, then it may have the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies to the thirteenth SMILES string in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group, then it may have the potential to cause respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. This rule applies to the sixteenth SMILES string in the dataset.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided by this small dataset and should be used cautiously until further research can confirm their validity.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of sulfur in the molecular structure, then it may lead to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders as well as other adverse effects such as skin irritation or corrosion. The specific type of disorder depends on the position and number of sulfur atoms present in the molecule. For example, if the sulfur atom is present at the end of a carbon chain, it may cause respiratory problems like asthma or bronchitis. On the other hand, if the sulfur atom is present within the ring structure, it may cause skin irritation or corrosion. Therefore, it is important to consider the chemical structure of the compound when predicting its potential adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring, then it may also lead to respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders due to its irritant nature. Additionally, compounds containing aromatic rings have been known to cause skin sensitization reactions which can lead to allergic responses. It is recommended to avoid exposure to these types of chemicals whenever possible.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may be associated with respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders as well as other adverse effects such as methemoglobinemia or cyanosis. These types of compounds can interfere with the transport of oxygen in the blood stream leading to tissue hypoxia. Therefore, it is essential to take precautions while handling or using substances containing this functional group.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a functional group such as carbonyl or carboxylic acid, it may have potential side effects on respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal organs. This rule can be applied to compounds labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, the first compound has a carbonyl group which could potentially affect these organs.
Rule 2: Compounds containing nitrogen atoms in their structure may also exhibit similar side effects if they are present in a conjugated system. The second compound in the dataset has a conjugated system involving two nitrogen atoms, making it more likely to cause adverse reactions.
Rule 3: A compound's solubility in water may play a role in its ability to cause adverse effects. Hydrophilic compounds tend to dissolve easily in water and may be more likely to interact with biological systems than hydrophobic ones. Therefore, compounds labeled as 1 in the dataset may contain hydrophilic groups such as hydroxyl or amine groups. However, this rule should be used cautiously since other factors such as molecular size and shape also influence toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) attached to an aromatic ring, it may have potential adverse effects on the respiratory system. The given SMILES string has a sulfonyl group in its structure which matches this rule. Therefore, we can assign label 1 for this compound.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) bonded to an sp3 hybridized carbon atom, it may have potential adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. However, none of the given compounds contain such a functional group. Hence, no inference can be made based on this rule.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a benzene ring or any other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, it may have potential adverse effects on the immune system. The given SMILES strings do not match this rule as they do not contain any aromatic rings. Thus, no inference can be made based on this rule either.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of any functional group such as "-COOH" or "-SO3H" in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on the respiratory system.
Rule 2: If there is a presence of any aromatic ring in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on the thoracic and mediastinal disorders.
Rule 3: If there is a presence of any halogen atom like chlorine or fluorine in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on the cardiovascular system.

They can also contribute to the overall polarity of the molecule, which can impact its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with other molecules within cells.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders. Halogen atoms can alter the electronic properties of the molecule, which can impact its chemical behavior and potential for interaction with biological systems. Additionally, they can increase the hydrophobicity of the molecule, which can enhance its ability to penetrate cell membranes and potentially cause harm.

This rule suggests that such compounds need careful evaluation during drug development process due to their potential toxicity.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure includes a carbonyl group bonded to two carbon atoms, it may potentially affect cardiovascular system. Such structures indicate that they might interfere with blood circulation and oxygen transport, leading to various health problems including heart attack and stroke. Therefore, this rule highlights the importance of evaluating the safety profile of such chemicals prior to using them as drugs.
