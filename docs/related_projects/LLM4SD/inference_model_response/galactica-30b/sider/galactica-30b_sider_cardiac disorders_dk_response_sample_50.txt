Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as nitro groups and halogen groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the heart. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, the first molecule contains a nitro group and a chlorine atom, which could potentially contribute to its cardiotoxicity.
Rule 2: The absence of certain functional groups or structural features in a molecule may decrease its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the heart. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 0 in the given dataset. For instance, the last molecule does not contain any functional groups commonly associated with cardiotoxicity, such as nitro or halogen groups, and therefore has a lower risk of causing adverse effects on the heart.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a molecule may also play a role in determining its potential for cardiotoxicity. Molecules with higher molecular weights and greater hydrophobicity may have a higher probability of crossing cell membranes and interacting with cellular components, leading to toxic effects. However, this rule should be used cautiously because these factors are not always predictive of toxicity and other factors such as metabolism and pharmacokinetics must also be considered.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1COCCN1CCNC(=O)C2=CC=C(C=C2)Cl, CC(CCC(=O)O)C1CCC2C1(C(CC3C2C(CC4C3(CCC(C4)O)C)O)O)C, CN(CC(CO)O)C(=O)C1=C(C(=C(C(=C1I)C(=O)NCC(CO)O)I)NC(=O)COC)I, CCC1=CNN(C2=C1NC(=NC2=O)C3=C(C=CC(=C3)S(=O)(=O)N4CCN(CC4)C)OCC)C, C1=CC(=CC=C1CCC2=CNC3=C2C(=O)N=C(N3)N)C(=O)N[C@H](CCC(=O)O)C(=O)O, CCS(=O)(=O)C(C)(C)C(F)(F)

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as chloride and carbonyl groups in a compound may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the heart. This rule can be applied to molecules like CCC(=O)OC1(C(CC2C1(CC(C3(C2CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC43C)F)O)C)C)C(=O)CCl and C1C(O1)CCl.
Rule 2: A compound containing metal ions or rare earth elements may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects on the heart. For example, COCCNC(=O)CN(CCN(CCN(CC(=O)NCCOC)CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-].[Gd+3] has a gadolinium ion which may interact with biological systems and lead to unwanted reactions.
Rule 3: Compounds with certain structural features may have a greater chance of causing adverse effects on the heart. For instance, compounds having a heterocyclic ring system like CC12CCC3C(C1CCC2O)CCC4=C3C=CC(=C4)OC(=O)N(CCCl)CCCl may exhibit cardiotoxic activities due to their unique chemical structure.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a double bond between carbon atoms in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects related to cardiac disorders. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings C[C@H]1/C=C/C=C(\C(=O)NC\2=C(C3=C(C(=C4C(=C3C(=O)/C2=C/NN5CCN(CC5)C)C(=O)[C@](O4)(O/C=C/[C@@H]([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H]1O)C)O)C)OC(=O)C)C)OC)C)C)O)/C and CC1=NC=CN1CC2CCC3=C(C2=O)C4=CC=CC=C4N3C.
Rule 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms in a molecule may also increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects related to cardiac disorders. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1CCC2=C(C1)C=CC=C2NC3=NCCN3 and CCC(C(=O)O)N.

Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) in its structure, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C(=O)(O)O 1, CC1=C(C(C(=C(N1)C)C(=O)OC)C2=CC=CC=C2[N+](=O)[O-])C(=O)OC 1, C(CCl)NC(=O)N(CCCl)N=O 1, CCC(=O)CCCCN1C(=O)C2=C(N=CN2C)N(C1=O)C 1, and COC1=CC(=CC(=C1O)OC)C2C3C(COC3=O)C(C4=CC5=C(C=C24)OCO5)OC6C(C(C7C(O6)COC(O7)C8=CC=CS8)O)O 1.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2) or a nitrate group (ONO2)

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonyl group (SO2R) in a compound may increase its likelihood of causing cardiac disorders as seen in SMILES strings labeled 1 for molecules such as CCCC1CC(N(C1)C)C(=O)NC(C2C(C(C(C(O2)SC)O)O)O)C(C)O and CN(C)C(=O)OC1=CC=CC(=C1)[N+](C)(C)C.
Rule 2: A compound containing a benzenesulfonamide moiety (C6H5SO2NH) may also have a higher risk of causing cardiac disorders as observed in SMILES strings labeled 1 for molecules like CC(CCC1=CC=C(C=C1)O)NCCC2=CC(=C(C=C2)O)O and C/C=C(/C)\C(=O)O[C@H]1C(=C[C@@]23[C@@]1([C@@H](C(=C[C@H](C2=O)[C@H]4[C@H](C4(C)C)C[C@H]3C)CO)O)O)C.
Rule 3: Compounds without any functional groups or structural features commonly associated with cardiotoxicity, such as those represented by SMILES strings labeled 0, may be less likely to cause cardiac disorders. For example, compounds like CC(C)(C)NCC(=O)NC1=C(C2=C(CC3CC4C(C(=O)C(=C(C4(C(=O)C3=C2

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a compound may increase its likelihood of causing cardiac disorders as seen in SMILES strings labeled 1 for compounds CC1(C(N2C(S1)C(C2=O)NC(=O)CC3=CC=CC=C3)C(=O)O)C and C1CNN(C(=O)C2SC(=O)NC2C(=O)NS(C)(=O)=O)C(=O)NNC(=O)c2ccc(cc2)Br.
Rule 2: A compound containing a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to a double bond or triple bond may also increase the risk of cardiac disorder as observed in SMILES strings labeled 1 for compounds CCCCCCCCCNCC=C.C[N+](C)(C)CCCCCCNCC=C.C=CCN.C1C(O1)CCl.Cl.[Cl-] and ClC(=C1C(=CC(=C1I)Br)C#N)C(=O)Nc2ccccc2.
Rule 3: Compounds containing a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring may have a higher chance of being associated with cardiac disorders as shown by SMILES strings labeled 1 for compounds C1=CC(=C(C=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a sulfonamide group in the first molecule and a nitro group in the second molecule suggest that they have potential cardiotoxic effects.
Rule 2: The molecular structure and size play a crucial role in determining the toxicity of a compound. A larger molecule may have more sites for interaction with biological molecules, leading to increased toxicity. Additionally, the shape and charge distribution of a molecule can also affect its ability to interact with other molecules.
Rule 3: The presence of specific atoms or bonds in a molecule may indicate its potential to cause adverse effects. For instance, the presence of chlorine atoms in the third molecule suggests that it has potential environmental hazards due to its reactivity and persistence. Similarly, the presence of sulfur atoms in the fourth molecule indicates that it may have toxic effects on aquatic organisms.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom, it is likely to have side-effects associated with cardiac disorders. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should be avoided or tested for their safety before being used in drug development.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have side-effects associated with cardiac disorders. However, this rule is less reliable than Rule 1 as there are other factors that could contribute to these adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it may have side-effects associated with cardiac disorders due to its ability to block certain enzymes involved in blood clotting. This rule is also less reliable than Rules 1 and 2 but still provides some insight into the potential risks associated with certain chemical groups.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carboxylic acid, ester, and amide in a compound may increase its likelihood of causing cardiac disorder side effects. This rule can be applied to molecules 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) or a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in a molecule may indicate potential cardiotoxicity. Therefore, molecules containing these functional groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles.
Rule 2: The molecular weight and lipophilicity of a molecule may also play a role in determining its toxicity profile. Molecules with high molecular weights and lipophilicities may have difficulty crossing cell membranes and reaching their target sites, which could lead to reduced efficacy and increased toxicity. Therefore, molecules with low molecular weights and hydrophilicities may be more favorable from a safety perspective.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule may also affect its biological activity and toxicity. For example, some drugs may exhibit different activities depending on their stereochemical configurations. Therefore, it is important to consider the stereochemistry of a molecule when evaluating its safety profile.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as nitro groups and halogen atoms in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the heart.
Explanation: These functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functioning, leading to adverse effects. For example, the nitro group present in the first SMILES string can interact with proteins involved in cardiac function, leading to potential cardiotoxicity.
Rule 2: The presence of aromatic rings in a molecule may also increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the heart.
Explanation: Aromatic rings are known to be hydrophobic and can interact with biological membranes, potentially disrupting their structure and function. This can lead to adverse effects on the heart, especially if the membrane is important for maintaining proper cardiac function.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule may also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects on the heart. Longer and more complex molecules may have greater flexibility and can adopt different conformations, which could affect their interaction with biological targets. However, this rule should be used cautiously since there may be other factors at play as well.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like "-COOH" or "-OH" in the structure of a molecule, then it has high probability of causing adverse effects on human body. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 and 0.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains aromatic rings, then it may have potential to cause adverse effects due to its hydrophobic nature. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 only.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains nitrogen atoms bonded to other nonmetal elements such as oxygen or sulfur, then it may have potential to cause adverse effects due to its reactivity. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 only.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1C(C(C(C(C1N)OC2C(C(C(C(O2)CN)O)O)N)OC3C(C(C(O3)CO)OC4C(C(C(C(O4)CN)O)O)N)O)O)N and CC(CC1=CC(=C(C=C1)O)O)(C(=O)O)N.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a guanidine group (-CNHC(=NH)NH-), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C(CN(CC(=O)O)CC(=O)O)N(CCN(CC(=O)O)CC(=O)O)CC(=O)O and CCC(=O)OC1(C(CC2C1(CC(C3(C2CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC43C)F)O)C)C)C(=O)CCl.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1[C@@H]2[C@@H](C2N)CN1C3=C(C=C4C(=O)C(=CN(C4=N3)C5=C(C=C(C=C5)F)F)C(=O)O)F 1 and CC1=C2C(=NC=C1)N(C3=C(C=CC=N3)C(=O)N2)C4CC4 0.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CN1CCN(CC1)C(C2=CC=CC=C2)C3=CC=CC=C3 1 and COC1=CC(=C(C=C1)OC)C(CNC(=O)CN)O 1.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have the potential to

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and carboxylic acid in a compound may increase its likelihood of causing cardiovascular side effects.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also have a higher risk of causing cardiotoxicity due to their ability to interact with biological membranes and disrupt cellular processes.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a compound's structure may also play a role in determining its potential for inducing cardiotoxic effects. Compounds with longer chains or more complex structures may be harder to metabolize and eliminate from the body, leading to prolonged exposure and increased toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular formula contains sodium or chlorine ions and has a negative charge, then it may have a potential risk for causing cardiac disorder as these ions play important roles in regulating heart function.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O), carboxyl group (COOH), and ester group (COOR), which are known to be associated with cardiovascular diseases, then it may have a higher chance of causing adverse effects on the heart.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains aromatic rings, conjugated double bonds, or triple bonds, they may increase its lipophilicity and make it easier to cross cell membranes, leading to increased toxicity towards cells including cardiomyocytes.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as nitro groups and halogens in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the heart. This rule can be inferred from the fact that compounds containing these functional groups have been known to cause cardiac disorders. For example, the compound CNC(=C[N+](=O)[O-])NCCSCC1=CC=C(O1)CN(C)C contains a nitro group and has been labeled as having potential cardiac disorder activity.
Rule 2: The molecular weight of a compound may also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects on the heart. Compounds with higher molecular weights may have more complex structures and therefore greater potential for interaction with biological systems. However, this rule should be used cautiously since there are many other factors that can influence a compound's toxicity. For instance, the compound C1=CC=C(C=C1)C2(C(=O)N(C(=O)N2)COP(=O)([O-])[O-])C3=CC=CC=C3.[Na+].[Na+] has a relatively high molecular weight but has been labeled as not having any potential cardiac disorder activity.
Rule 3: The presence of certain substructures within a compound may indicate its potential to cause adverse effects on the heart. For example, the compound CC(C[N+](C)(C)C)OC(=O)C contains the substructure CCC(=O)OC which has been associated with cardiotoxicity. Therefore, this compound has been labeled as potentially having cardiac disorder activity.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a functional group such as "-NO_2" or "-COOH" in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on the heart.
Explanation: The presence of these groups increases the polarity and hydrophilicity of the molecule, which can affect its absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity profile. These groups can also interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal function, leading to adverse effects.
Example: Molecule 5 contains a nitro group (-NO_2) and has been labeled as having potential cardiac disorder side-effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a heterocyclic ring system, especially those containing nitrogen atoms, then it may have cardiotoxic effects.
Explanation: Heterocyclic rings contain at least one non-carbon atom, usually nitrogen or oxygen, and are commonly found in drugs and other biologically active compounds. Nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as pyridine and pyrimidine, can act as hydrogen bond acceptors and donors, affecting protein-ligand interactions and potentially disrupting cellular processes.
Example: Molecule 6 contains a pyridazine ring and has been labeled as having potential cardiac disorder side-effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a long carbon chain with multiple double bonds, then it may have arrhythmogenic effects.
Explanation: Long carbon chains with multiple double bonds can interfere with the electrical activity of the heart by altering ion channel conductance and causing abnormal depolarization and repolarization patterns. This can lead to arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.
Example: Molecule 7 contains a conjugated di

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a thiocyanate group (-SCN) or a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and are labeled as having a risk factor for cardiac disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains this feature and is labeled as having a risk factor for cardiac disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders. The seventh molecule in the dataset contains this feature and is labeled as having a risk factor for cardiac disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in a molecule has been linked to cardiotoxicity and other adverse effects. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for potential toxicity.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule can also affect its ability to interact with biological targets and potentially cause adverse effects. Molecules with a larger surface area or more flexible structures may have greater access to target sites within cells and tissues, increasing their potential for interaction and toxicity. Therefore, molecules with smaller or less flexible structures may be safer to use.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule can also play a role in its toxicity. For example, some chiral drugs may have different activities depending on their configuration, leading to differences in potency and safety. Therefore, it is important to consider the stereochemical properties of a molecule when evaluating its potential risks and benefits.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular formula contains Ca+2 ions and has a negative charge, then it may have potential cardiotoxic effects. This rule applies only to one specific compound in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may be associated with cardiovascular toxicity. The presence of these functional groups indicates that the molecule could interact with biological systems in ways that lead to harmful outcomes. However, this rule does not apply to all compounds containing these functional groups as some may still be safe for use.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, a nitrogen atom, and a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may potentially exhibit cardiotoxic effects. These structural features suggest that the molecule could act as an agonist at certain receptors involved in heart function. Again, this rule should be used cautiously since other molecules with similar structures may not necessarily have the same effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amides and sulfonamides in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the heart. This rule can be applied to molecules like C(CCC(=O)O)CCN 1 and CC(C)NC1=C(N=CC=C1)N2CCN(CC2)C(=O)C3=CC4=C(N3)C=CC(=C4)NS(=O)(=O)C 1 where the amide group is present.
Rule 2: The presence of negatively charged ions or atoms such as sodium in a compound may decrease its potential for causing adverse effects on the heart. This rule can be applied to molecules like C[C@@H]1CCO[C@@H]2N1C(=O)C3=C(C(=O)C(=CN3C2)C(=O)NCC4=C(C=C(C=C4)F)F)[O-].[Na+] 0 where the sodium ion is present.
Rule 3: The presence of aromatic rings in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the heart. This rule can be applied to molecules like CNCCCN1C2=CC=CC=C2CCC3=CC=CC=C31 1 where the benzene ring is present.

Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as OP(=O)(O)[O-] or CNC1(CCCCC1=O)C2=CC=CC=C2Cl, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a functional group such as CN(C)CCC=C1C2=CC=CC=C2COC3=C1C=C(C=C3)CC(=O)O.Cl, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a functional group such as CC1=CC(=C(C=C1)SC2=CC=CC=C2N3CCNCC3)C, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders.
Note that these rules are just examples and should not be used as the only criteria for predicting adverse effects. It's important to consider other factors such as dosage, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility when evaluating the safety of a molecule.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group called "carbonyl" (represented by the symbol C=O) in conjugation with another double bond or aromatic ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders. This rule applies to molecules such as C1=CC=C(C(=C1)C(=O)O)O, CN1C(=O)CN=C(C2=C1C=CC(=C2)Cl)C3=CC=CC=C3, CC1=CC(=NN1C2=CS(=O)(=O)C3=CC=C(C=C32)OS(=O)(=O)C)SCC(=NH)N, COC1C(CC2CN3CCC4=C(C3CC2C1C(=O)OC)NC5=C4C=CC(=C5)OC)OC(=O)C=CC6=CC(=C(C(=C6)OC)OC)OC, CCC1=C(N=CN1)CSCCNC(=NC)NC#N, CCS(=O)(=O)C1=C(C=C(C=C1)C(CNN)O)OC(=O)C(C)(C)C, etc.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and nitro groups in a compound may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the heart. This rule can be applied by analyzing the chemical structure of the compounds using computational tools or by conducting experiments.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects due to their ability to interact with biological molecules through π-π stacking interactions. Therefore, the number and position of aromatic rings in a compound should be considered when predicting its potential toxicity.
Rule 3: The length and flexibility of a compound's carbon chain may affect its ability to penetrate cell membranes and reach target sites within the body. Longer chains and more flexible structures may lead to increased toxicity. Therefore, the molecular weight and lipophilicity of a compound should also be taken into account when evaluating its potential cardiotoxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels of 1, indicating that they do have this potential.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders. The fourth molecule in the dataset contains this group and it also has a label of 1.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a benzimidazole moiety (a fused benzene and imidazole ring system), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders. The last four molecules in the dataset contain this moiety and all but one have labels of 1. However, it's important to note that these rules are just suggestions and should not be used as definitive indicators without further testing and analysis.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders. This rule applies to molecules in rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders. This rule applies to molecules in row 1 only.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom (-F) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders. This rule applies to molecules in rows 2, 3, and 4 only.
Note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the given dataset and should be used as a starting point for further analysis rather than definitive conclusions.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in a conjugated system containing multiple double bonds, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders. The presence of fluorine atoms in molecules can affect their chemical and physical properties, including their reactivity, solubility, and lipophilicity. Fluorine atoms can also alter the electronic distribution within a molecule, which can impact its biological activity. Therefore, this rule suggests that fluorinated compounds should be carefully evaluated for their potential cardiotoxic effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring or an unsaturated aliphatic chain, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders. Nitro groups are known to be highly reactive and can interact with various biological targets, leading to toxic effects. This rule suggests that compounds containing nitro groups should be carefully evaluated for their potential cardiotoxic effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to cardiac disorders. Sulfonamides are a class of antibiotics that inhibit bacterial growth by blocking the production of folic acid. However, some sulfonamide derivatives have been associated with cardiovascular toxicity, such as QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes. This rule suggests that compounds containing sulfonamide groups should be carefully evaluated for their potential cardiotoxic effects.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a benzene ring, then it may have potential side effects on cardiac disorders. The given SMILES string has both these features, so it should be labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in a phenyl ring, then it may also have potential side effects on cardiac disorders. The second SMILES string has this feature, so it should be labeled as 1.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to a nitrogen atom, then it may not have any significant side effects on cardiac disorders. The last SMILES string has this feature, so it should be labeled as 0.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonyl group (SO2R) in a compound may increase its likelihood of causing cardiovascular side effects. This rule applies to compounds with the SMILES string "CCCC1CC(N(C1)C)C(=O)NC(C2C(C(C(C(O2)SC)O)O)O)C(C)Cl" and "COCCOC1=C(C=C2C(=C1)C(=NC=N2)NC3=CC=CC(=C3)C#C)OCCOC".
Rule 2: A compound containing a nitrile group (-CN) may have a higher risk of causing cardiotoxicity than other functional groups. This rule applies to compounds with the SMILES string "CCN(CC)C(C)C(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1".
Rule 3: Compounds with a benzimidazole ring structure may be associated with increased risks of heart disease. This rule applies to compounds with the SMILES strings "CC1([C@@H](N2[C@H](S1)[C@@H](C2=O)NC(=O)CC3=CC=CC=C3)C(=O)O)C.CC1([C@@H](N2[C@H](S1)[C@@H](C2=O)NC(=O)CC3=CC

================================

Rule 1: If there is a nitro group (-NO2) present in the structure of a molecule, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects on the heart. The presence of this functional group may lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species which can damage cellular components and lead to various cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and heart failure. Therefore, molecules containing this group should be avoided or used with caution if they have potential therapeutic applications.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a benzene ring conjugated with a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have a higher chance of causing adverse effects on the heart due to its ability to interact with biological membranes and disrupt their normal function. This type of interaction can lead to changes in membrane permeability, ion transport, and enzyme activity, which can ultimately result in cell death or tissue injury. Therefore, molecules containing these structural features should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile before being considered for use in pharmaceutical formulations.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a metal ion such as platinum (Pt) or iron (Fe), then it may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on the heart due to their ability to generate free radicals through redox reactions. These highly reactive species can damage DNA, proteins, and lipids, leading to oxidative stress and inflammation, which can contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, molecules containing these metals should be thoroughly tested for their toxicity and potential cardiotoxic effects before being approved for clinical use.

Rule 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in the structure may also increase the risk of causing cardiotoxicity as seen in SMILES string labeled as 1 for molecule CN(C)CC1CCCCC1(C2=CC(=CC=C2)OC)O. However, this rule should be used cautiously since there could be other factors involved such as dosage and duration of exposure. Rule 3: The absence of certain functional groups or fragments in the structure may reduce the likelihood of causing cardiotoxicity as seen in SMILES strings labeled as 0 for molecules C1=CC=C(C=C1)N2C=C(C=C(C2=O)C3=CC=CC=C3C#N)C4=CC=CC=N4 and CCC(C)C(=O)OC1CC(C=C2C1C(C(C
