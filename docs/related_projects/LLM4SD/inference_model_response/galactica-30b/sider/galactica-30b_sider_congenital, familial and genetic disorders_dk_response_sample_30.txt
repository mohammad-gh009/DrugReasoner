Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. This rule applies to molecules such as CCCCNNHCONHS(=O)(=O)SCCCCNC(=O)c1cccnc1.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. This rule applies to molecules such as C6H4ClNO2.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. This rule applies to molecules such as CC(C)Br.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a bromine atom, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. The presence of this element in the molecular structure suggests that it may interact with biological systems in ways that could lead to negative health outcomes.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. Fluorine is similar in size to chlorine but more electronegative, which can affect the electronic distribution within the molecule and potentially alter its reactivity or binding affinity towards biological targets.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease. Cyano groups are known to interfere with normal cellular processes by disrupting protein function or altering enzyme activity, and they have been linked to various types of neurotoxicity.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any functional group such as carbonyl or carboxylic acid present in the structure, then it may lead to adverse effects. The presence of these groups increases the reactivity of the compound which may interact with other molecules leading to toxicity. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: If the molecular weight of the compound is high, then it may also lead to adverse effects due to its increased hydrophobicity. Hydrophobic compounds tend to accumulate in lipid membranes causing damage to cells. Hence, compounds with higher molecular weights should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxic effects.
Rule 3: Compounds containing aromatic rings have been shown to exhibit toxic effects on living organisms. These compounds can bind to proteins and enzymes resulting in disruption of normal cellular processes. Therefore, compounds containing aromatic rings should be used cautiously unless they are essential for the desired biological activity.

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in a five-membered ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. The presence of this functional group in the molecule may increase its reactivity and ability to interact with biological systems, which could lead to negative health outcomes.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a cyclopropane ring, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. This functional group is known for its high reactivity and ability to form covalent bonds with other molecules, which could interfere with normal cellular processes and lead to negative health outcomes.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. This functional group is commonly found in many toxic compounds and is known for its ability to disrupt normal metabolic pathways and cause damage to cells and tissues.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide, nitro, or halogen groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects. These groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles.
Rule 2: Compounds with a high degree of lipophilicity tend to have higher chances of crossing cell membranes and interacting with intracellular targets. This property can lead to increased toxicity and adverse effects. Therefore, compounds with low solubility in water should be avoided or used with caution.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a compound's structure can also affect its ability to cross cell membranes and reach target sites. Longer and more complex structures may require active transport mechanisms to enter cells, which can limit their bioavailability and increase their potential for adverse effects. Therefore, simpler and shorter structures may be preferred when designing new drugs.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group called "carbonyl" (represented by the symbol "C=O" in the SMILES notation), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by the first two SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a functional group called "nitrile" (represented by the symbol "#CN" or "C#N" in the SMILES notation), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by the third SMILES string labeled as 1 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a functional group called "sulfonamide" (represented by the symbols "SO2NH" or "SNHNSO2" in the SMILES notation), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by the last four SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the dataset.

================================



================================

Rule 1: If there is any occurrence of the SMILES string "CC#N" or "Cc1ccccc1" in the molecular structure, then it may cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial and genetic disorders.
Explanation: The SMILES strings "CC#N" and "Cc1ccccc1" represent a carbon-nitrogen double bond and a cyclopentane ring respectively. These structures are commonly found in drugs used for treating diseases such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and thalassemia. These diseases are known to be caused by mutations in genes that affect the production of proteins involved in ion transport across membranes, oxygen binding, and hemoglobin synthesis. Therefore, molecules containing these structures may have the potential to interact with these mutated proteins and restore their function, leading to therapeutic benefits. However, these same interactions could also lead to adverse effects if they disrupt normal protein functions.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial and genetic disorders.
Explanation: Nitro groups are known to be toxic and carcinogenic due to their ability to form reactive intermediates upon reduction. They are often present in pesticides, explosives, and industrial chemicals. Molecules containing nitro groups attached to aromatic rings may undergo metabolic activation to form electrophilic species that can bind to DNA and other macromolecules, leading to mutagenesis and carcinogenesis.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may cause adverse effects related to congenital, familial and genetic disorders.
Explanation: Sulfonamides are antibiotics that inhibit bacterial growth by competing with p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) for incorporation into folic acid. Bacteria require folic acid for DNA synthesis and repair, so inhibition of its biosynthesis leads to cell death. However, some bacteria have evolved resistance to sulfonamides through various mechanisms, including mutation of the gene encoding dihydropteroate synthase, which catalyzes the conversion of PABA to dihydrofolate. Therefore, molecules containing sulfonamide groups may have the potential to select for resistant strains of bacteria in the gut microbiome.

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a functional group such as NC or NCC, it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects in individuals with congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled with 0 in the dataset. For example, the fourth and sixth SMILES strings contain NC or NCC groups and are labeled with 0.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a metal ion such as Cl or Na, it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects in individuals with congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled with 0 in the dataset. For example, the eighth and ninth SMILES strings contain Cl or Na ions and are labeled with 0.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a fluoro group (-F), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in patients who have congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C(CNCCNCCN)N, C1=NC(=O)NC(=C1F)N, CCN(CC)C(=O)[C@@]1(C[C@@H]1C[NH3+])C2=CC=CC=C2.[Cl-], C1=CC=C(C=C1)NC(=O)CCCCCCC(=O)NO, C1C2CC3CC1CC(C2)(C3)N, CCCC(C)(CC=C[C@H]1[C@@H](CC(=O)[C@@H]1CCCCCCC(=O)OC)O)O, CON=C1CN(CC1CN)C2=C(C=C3C(=O)C(=CN(C3=N2)C4CC4)C(=O)O)F, CC(C)CC(C(=O)NC(CCCN=C(N)N)C(=O)N1CC
