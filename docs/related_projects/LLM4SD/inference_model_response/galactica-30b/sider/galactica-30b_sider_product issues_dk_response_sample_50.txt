Rule 1: If there is a nitro group (-NO2) present in the structure of the molecule, then it may cause adverse effects. The presence of this functional group increases the reactivity of the molecule and can lead to toxic reactions or side effects. Therefore, molecules containing nitro groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), especially in conjugation with other double bonds such as alkenes or aromatic rings, it may also increase its reactivity and potential for toxicity. This is because the carbonyl group can react with other molecules through nucleophilic addition or substitution reactions. Therefore, caution should be taken when using these types of compounds.
Rule 3: If the molecule has a long carbon chain or a complex structure, it may have difficulty crossing cell membranes and reaching target sites within the body. This could result in lower efficacy or even lack of effectiveness. Therefore, simpler structures with fewer substituents may be preferred over more complex ones.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having side-effect activity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. The second molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having side-effect activity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. The third molecule in the dataset contains such a system and has been labeled as having side-effect activity.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a cyano group present in the structure of the molecule, then it may have potential side effects. The presence of this functional group indicates that the compound could be toxic and harmful to human health. Therefore, molecules containing such groups should be avoided or used with caution.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, then it may also have potential side effects. Carboxylic acids are known to be irritants and can cause skin irritation, respiratory problems, and other health issues. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be handled carefully or avoided altogether.
Rule 3: If the molecule has a long carbon chain, then it may also have potential side effects. Long carbon chains can be hydrophobic, which means they do not mix well with water. This property can make them difficult for the body to digest and absorb, leading to potential health issues. Therefore, molecules containing long carbon chains should be used with caution or avoided entirely.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and is labeled as having no adverse effects. However, further research would need to be done to confirm any correlation between the presence of a sulfonamide group and adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains two or more negatively charged oxygen atoms (e.g., in the form of carboxylate groups), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. The third molecule in the dataset contains three such oxygen atoms and is labeled as having no adverse effects. Again, further research would need to be done to confirm any correlation between multiple negatively charged oxygen atoms and adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a metal ion (in this case, lanthanum ions), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to their ability to interact with other molecules and disrupt normal biological processes. The fourth molecule in the dataset contains two lanthanum ions and is labeled as having no adverse effects. Further research would need to be done to determine how common these interactions are and what impact they might have on human health.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in a molecule has been linked to increased toxicity and side effects. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for potential risks before being used in products.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule can also affect its ability to interact with biological systems and potentially cause harm. Molecules that are too large or have a non-optimal shape may not be able to penetrate cell membranes or bind effectively to target receptors, leading to reduced efficacy or off-target effects. Therefore, molecules with inappropriate sizes or shapes should be avoided or used cautiously.
Rule 3: The charge and polarity of a molecule can also play a role in its ability to interact with biological systems. Charged or polar molecules may be more likely to interact with charged or polar regions on proteins or other biomolecules, leading to altered function or disruption of normal cellular processes. Therefore, molecules with high charges or polarities should be evaluated carefully for potential safety concerns.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a bromine atom, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to the first SMILES string in the dataset where the presence of bromine indicates possible toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a thiophene ring, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to the second SMILES string in the dataset where the sulfur atom in the thiophene ring is known for its toxic properties.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to the third SMILES string in the dataset where the nitro group is known to be highly reactive and can cause damage to cells.
It's important to note that these rules are just suggestions and should be used cautiously as they are not foolproof and there may be other factors that contribute to the potential toxicity of a molecule.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a phosphate group (PO4R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule is based on the fact that these groups are commonly found in drugs that have been associated with serious side effects such as skin rashes, liver damage, and allergic reactions.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. Nitro compounds are known to be toxic and can cause tissue damage, nerve damage, and other health problems.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) attached to a carbon atom, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. Halogen atoms are often present in pesticides and other chemicals that have been linked to cancer, reproductive problems, and other health hazards.
It's important to note that these rules are generalizations and should only be used as a starting point for predicting potential adverse effects. It's always best to consult with experts in the field and conduct thorough testing before making any decisions about using a particular chemical.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 1, 8, and 9 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 10 and 11 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains both a sulfonamide group and a nitro group, it may have even greater potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecule 1 only.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided by this small dataset and should be used cautiously until further research can be conducted.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules C1C(C(OC1N2C=NC3=C2N=C(N=C3N)Cl)CO)O, CC1=CN(C(=O)C=C1)C2=CC=CC=C2, COC1=CC(=CC(=C1O)OC)C2C3C(COC3=O)C(C4=CC5=C(C=C24)OCO5)OC6C(C(C7C(O6)COC(O7)C8=CC=CS8)O)O, CCC(=O)OCC(=O)C1(C(CC2C1(CC(C3C2C(CC4=CC(=O)C=CC34C)Cl)O)C)C)OC(=O)CC, CCS(=O)(=O)CCN1C(=NC=C1[N+](=O)[O-])C, CN(C)CCCN1C2=CC=CC=C2SC3=C1C=C(C=C3)Cl, CC(C)NCC(C1=CC(=C(C=C

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The first two molecules in the dataset contain this functional group and they both have labels indicating their potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. The third molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and it also has a label indicating its potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. The sixth molecule in the dataset contains a chlorine atom and it has a label indicating its potential to cause adverse effects. However, note that these rules are just suggestions and should not be used as the only criteria for predicting adverse effects. Other factors such as dosage, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility should also be taken into account.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The first example in the dataset contains a sulfonamide group and is labeled as having no side-effects. Therefore, this rule should be applied cautiously since there may be other factors involved in causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. The third example in the dataset contains a nitro group and is labeled as having no side-effects. However, it's important to note that this rule may not always hold true since some molecules containing nitro groups may still be safe to use.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The last two examples in the dataset contain halogens and are labeled as having no side-effects. Again, this rule should be applied cautiously since there may be other factors involved in causing adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of functional group like C-Cl or N-Cl in the molecular structure, then it may lead to potential toxicity and adverse effects on human health. The presence of such groups makes the compound more reactive and prone to interact with other molecules leading to toxic reactions. Therefore, it is important to avoid using compounds containing these functional groups if possible.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains aromatic rings, especially those with electron withdrawing substituents like -COOH, -CHO, etc., they may increase the reactivity of the compound and make it more susceptible to oxidative stress and damage to cells. Such compounds should be used cautiously as they may have potential harmful effects on human health.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure has multiple bonds between carbon atoms, particularly double bonds, they may enhance the lipophilicity of the compound making it easier for it to cross cell membranes and potentially affect cellular processes. It is recommended to use caution when handling compounds having such structures.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide or nitro group in the structure of a molecule, then it may lead to potential adverse effects. The given SMILES strings do not have these functional groups present. Therefore, they are less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains halogen atoms like chlorine and fluorine, it may increase its lipophilicity which could result in increased absorption through cell membranes leading to potential adverse effects. However, none of the given SMILES strings contain halogens. Hence, they are less likely to cause adverse effects due to this reason.
Rule 3: If a molecule has a high degree of conjugation between multiple double bonds, it may increase its reactivity towards other molecules resulting in potential adverse effects. None of the given SMILES strings have highly conjugated structures. Thus, they are less likely to cause adverse effects due to this reason.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a negatively charged ion such as [OH-] or [Cl-], then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its ability to disrupt cellular processes. This rule applies to molecules labeled as "1" in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a metal ion such as Mn+2, Gd, Na+, or Ca+2, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its ability to interact with other molecules and disrupt their normal functions. This rule also applies to molecules labeled as "1" in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a functional group such as C=ON, CN, COOR, or SO3R, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its ability to bind to proteins and interfere with their function. This rule applies to all molecules in the dataset regardless of their labels.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any negative charge in the structure, it may lead to potential toxicity or adverse effects. The presence of sodium ions (Na+) and chloride ion (Cl-) in the given SMILES strings indicate the possibility of ionic bonds between them which could affect their reactivity and biological activity. Therefore, molecules containing such ions should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.
Rule 2: A molecule with a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a benzene ring has a higher chance of causing adverse effects than one without it. This is because the C=O bond is highly polar and can interact with other functional groups present in the body leading to toxic reactions. For example, the second compound in the list contains a carbonyl group connected to a phenyl ring through a carbon atom. It also contains a nitro group (-NO2) which is known to be toxic.
Rule 3: Molecules having multiple rings or fused rings tend to have lower solubility in water and higher lipophilicity compared to those with single rings. They may accumulate in lipid-rich tissues like the brain or liver resulting in adverse effects. For instance, the last two compounds in the list contain multiple aromatic rings and exhibit low aqueous solubility due to their hydrophobic nature.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (-Cl), fluorine (-F), or bromine (-Br), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a phosphate group (-PO4) or a sulfate group (-SO4), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule is based on the fact that these groups are commonly found in drugs and other molecules that have been associated with side effects. For example, the first molecule in the dataset contains two potassium ions and two oxygen atoms connected by double bonds, which suggests that it might contain a phosphate group. The second molecule also contains a phosphate group as part of a larger organic compound.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule is based on the fact that nitro compounds are often toxic and can cause serious health problems. For example, the fifth molecule in the dataset contains a nitro group attached to a benzene ring.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule is based on the fact that many pharmaceuticals and other chemicals containing halogens have been linked to various health risks. For example, the ninth molecule in the dataset contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom (-F) attached to a benzene ring, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 3 and 17 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 18 and 19 in the dataset.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The first molecule in the dataset contains a sulfonyl group and is labeled as having no adverse effects. Therefore, this rule should be applied cautiously and further research would be needed to confirm its validity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The third molecule in the dataset contains a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring and is labeled as having no adverse effects. However, since only one example is available, more data would need to be collected to validate this rule.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to an sp3 carbon, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The sixth molecule in the dataset contains a chlorine atom bonded to an sp3 carbon and is labeled as having no adverse effects. Again, more data would need to be collected to validate this rule.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a chlorine atom and a carbonyl group (C=O), then it may have potential side effects. The presence of these functional groups in a compound increases its reactivity and can lead to unwanted interactions with other molecules or biological systems.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a sulfur-selenium bond (S=[Se]=S), then it may have potential side effects. Sulfur and selenium are both essential elements for human health but can also be toxic at high concentrations. They can interact with proteins and enzymes in the body, leading to various negative effects.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a carboxylic acid group (COOH) attached to a carbon chain, then it may have potential side effects. Carboxylic acids are known to have irritant and corrosive properties and can cause skin irritation, eye damage, and respiratory problems. Additionally, some carboxylic acids can act as allergens or sensitizers, causing immune responses in sensitive individuals.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds or aromatic rings, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1=C/C(=C/2\N/C(=C\3/C=CC=CC3=O)/N(N2)C4=CC=C(C=C4)C(=O)O)/C(=O)C=C1, CC1=C(C(=CC=C1)Cl)NC(=O)C2=CN=C(S2)NC3=NC(=NC(=C3)N4CCN(CC4)CCO)C, C1=CN(C(=O)NC1=O)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)O[C@@H]3[C@H](O[C@H]([C@@H]3O)N4C=CC(=O)NC4=O)CO)O)O, C1=NC2=C(C(=N1)N)N=CN2C3C(C(

================================

Rule 1: If there exists any functional group such as "-NO_2" or "-COOH" in the molecular structure, then it may lead to potential toxicity and side effects. This rule can be applied by checking for the presence of these groups using chemical software tools like ChemDraw orInChIKey.
Rule 2: If the molecular weight of the compound is greater than 500 Daltons, then it may have poor absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) characteristics due to its large size. Therefore, it may require further optimization to improve its pharmacokinetic profile before being considered for drug development.
Rule 3: If the compound contains multiple aromatic rings, then it may have higher lipophilicity and lower water solubility, which could affect its ADMET properties. Hence, it is important to optimize the number and position of aromatic rings in the molecular structure to improve its bioavailability.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1CCC(CC1)C(CC2CCCCN2)C3CCCCC3, CCOC(=O)O[C@@]1(CCC2[C@@]1(C[C@@H](C3C2CCC4=CC(=O)C=C[C@]34C)O)C)C(=O)OCCl, CN(C1=C(C(=C(C(=C1I)C(=O)NC(CO)C(CO)O)I)C(=O)NC(CO)C(CO)O)I)C(=O)CC(=O)N(C)C2=C(C(=C(C(=C2I)C(=O)NC(CO)C(CO)O)I)C(=O)NC(CO)C(CO)O)I, CCCNNC(=O)NCC(COC1=CC=CC=C1OCC=C)O, CCSSCC(=O)N[C@@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@@H](CSSCCC(=O)N[C@@H](C(=O)N1)CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The presence of this functional group in certain drugs such as glibenclamide and tolbutamide has been linked to hypoglycemic episodes or low blood sugar levels. Therefore, molecules containing this group should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxicity.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. Nitro compounds are known to be toxic and can cause tissue damage through free radical formation. Therefore, molecules containing this group should be avoided or used with caution.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. Halogen atoms can interfere with normal biochemical processes and can lead to organ damage or other health problems. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be thoroughly tested before being marketed.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and is labeled as having no adverse effects. However, further research would need to be done to confirm any correlation between the presence of this group and adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a gadolinium ion (Gd+3), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its paramagnetic nature which can affect magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The third molecule in the dataset contains Gd+3 and is also labeled as having no adverse effects. Again, more research would be needed to determine if there is a causal relationship between the presence of Gd+3 and adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) conjugated with an aromatic ring, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its ability to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) under certain conditions. The sixth molecule in the dataset contains such a group and is labeled as having no adverse effects. Further studies would be required to establish a definitive link between the presence of this group and adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as "CCON" or "CCS", then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule is based on the fact that these groups are commonly found in drugs that have been associated with side effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule is based on the fact that halogens are often used in drug design to modify the chemical properties of molecules, but they can also increase the likelihood of side effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule is based on the fact that nitro compounds are known to be toxic and can cause serious health problems.
It's important to note that these rules are generalizations and should only be used as a starting point for predicting potential side effects. It's always best to consult medical literature and experts in the field when making decisions about medication safety.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a bromine atom or a platinum ion, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "C[N+]1(CC[C@]23[C@@H]4C(=O)CC[C@]2([C@H]1CC5=C3C(=C(C=C5)O)O4)O)CC6CC6.[Br-] 0" or "C1CC(C1)(C(=O)O)C(=O)O.N.N.[Pt] 0". These compounds contain either a bromine atom or a platinum ion, which suggests that they may have some toxic properties.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a cyano group (-CN) bonded to an alkene, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "CN(CC=CC1=CC=CC=C1)CC2=CC=CC3=CC=CC=C32.Cl 0". The presence of a cyano group in this molecule suggests that it may be reactive and potentially harmful.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a nitro group (

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules in rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules in rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a heterocyclic ring system, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules in rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
It's important to note that these rules are generalizations and should only be used as a starting point for predicting potential adverse effects. Further testing and analysis would be necessary to confirm any potential risks associated with specific compounds.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as a carbonyl group or a double bond between carbon atoms, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a nitrile group (-CN), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules in rows 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70,

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules #8, #9, and #17 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules #10 and #11 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains both a sulfonamide group and a nitro group, it may have even greater potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecule #17 in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a functional group such as "-COOH" or "-OH" in the molecular structure, then it may lead to potential adverse effects. This rule is based on the fact that these groups can interact with other molecules and disrupt their normal functions. For example, in the first SMILES string, the presence of "-COOH" group may increase the acidity of the compound, which could result in irritation or inflammation at the site of contact.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains multiple rings or aromatic systems, it may also contribute to potential adverse effects. This rule is based on the fact that these structures can be toxic and interfere with cellular processes. For instance, in the second SMILES string, the presence of two fused five-membered rings may make the compound more reactive and potentially harmful.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a large number of nitrogen atoms or nitro groups, it may indicate potential toxicity. This rule is based on the fact that these groups can disrupt electron transfer reactions and alter cell membrane permeability. For example, in the sixth SMILES string, the presence of three nitro groups may increase the compound's reactivity and potential for DNA damage.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a positively charged nitrogen atom bonded to four carbon atoms in a ring structure, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to the first SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 0.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to the second SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 0.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to another carbonyl group through a single bond or a double bond, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to the third SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 0.
It's important to note that these rules are just suggestions based on the limited information provided in the dataset. Further research and analysis would be needed to confirm their validity and applicability to other molecules.

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The first molecule in the dataset contains a sulfonyl group and is labeled as having no adverse effects. However, this rule should be taken with caution since other factors such as dosage and individual susceptibility also play a role in determining the likelihood of adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The second molecule in the dataset contains a nitro group and is labeled as having no adverse effects. Again, this rule should be taken with caution since other factors such as dosage and individual susceptibility also play a role in determining the likelihood of adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrile group (-CN), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The third molecule in the dataset contains a nitrile group and is labeled as having no adverse effects. This rule should be further investigated since only one example was provided in the dataset.

Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The first four molecules in the dataset contain this functional group, and all of them have been labeled as having the potential to cause adverse effects. However, this rule should be used cautiously because there may be other factors involved besides the presence of the sulfonyl group.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. The fifth molecule in the dataset contains this functional group, and it has been labeled as having the potential to cause adverse effects. Again, this rule should be used cautiously because there may be other factors involved besides the presence of the nitro group.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains both a sulfonyl group and a nitro group, it may have even greater potential to cause adverse effects. The sixth molecule in the dataset contains both these functional groups, and it has been labeled as having the greatest potential to cause adverse effects among all the molecules in the dataset.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The first example in the dataset contains such a group and has been labeled as having no side-effects. However, this rule should be taken with caution since there are many other factors that can contribute to the toxicity of a compound.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. The second example in the dataset contains such a group and has been labeled as having no side-effects. Again, this rule should be taken with caution since there are many other factors that can contribute to the toxicity of a compound.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its ability to react with other molecules and disrupt their normal function. This is supported by the fifth example in the dataset which contains four fluorines and has been labeled as having no side-effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule is based on the fact that these functional groups are known to be toxic and can cause various health problems in humans.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. Halogen atoms are known to be highly reactive and can interact with other molecules in the body, leading to toxicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. Conjugated systems are often associated with high reactivity and can interact with other molecules in the body, leading to toxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 8, 9, and 10 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 11 and 12 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 13 and 14 in the dataset.
It's important to note that these rules are just suggestions and should not be used as the only method for predicting adverse effects. It's always best to consult with a qualified chemist before making any decisions based on these rules.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a benzene ring (represented by the SMILES string C1=CC=CC=C1) or a similar aromatic system, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules in rows 8, 9, 10, and 11 of the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (represented by the SMILES string CN1C2=CC=CC=C2SCN3=NN=N31), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules in row 12 of the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (represented by the SMILES strings CO and CC(=O)O), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules in rows 3, 4, and 5 of the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects. This is because the cyano group is highly reactive and can interact with other molecules in the body, potentially leading to negative consequences. Therefore, if a molecule contains a cyano group, it should be carefully evaluated for any potential side effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. Sulfonyl groups are commonly used in drugs as a way to target specific tissues or cells, but they can also react with other molecules in the body and lead to unwanted reactions. Therefore, it is important to evaluate molecules containing sulfonyl groups for their potential side effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with a phosphate group (-OPO3H2) may also pose a risk for causing adverse effects. Phosphate groups are found in many essential molecules such as DNA and ATP, but they can also become detached from these molecules and interact with other parts of the cell, potentially leading to negative consequences. Therefore, it is important to evaluate molecules containing phosphate groups for their potential side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The first two molecules in the dataset contain a nitro group and they both have label 0 indicating no known association with adverse effects. However, this rule should be taken with caution as other factors such as dosage and exposure time may also play a role in determining the toxicity of a compound.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The fifth molecule in the dataset contains a chlorine atom and it has label 1 indicating a known association with adverse effects. This rule is supported by research showing that halogens can increase the reactivity of a molecule and enhance its ability to interact with biological systems.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The last four molecules in the dataset all contain a conjugated system of double bonds and they all have label 0 indicating no known association with adverse effects. Conjugated systems can increase the stability of a molecule but can also make it more reactive and potentially toxic.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three possible rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in the ring structure, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 7, 8, 9, and 10.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a carbon atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 11 and 12.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) attached to a carbon atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecule 13.
Note that these rules are just examples and should not be considered definitive or exhaustive. It's important to keep in mind that there may be other factors that contribute to a molecule's ability to cause adverse effects beyond its chemical structure alone.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "CS(=O)(=O)" or "OS(=O)(=O)". For example, in the first SMILES string, "CCOC1=CC=CC=C1OCCN[C@@H](C)CC2=CC(=C(C=C2)OC)S(=O)(=O)N.Cl 0", the presence of the sulfonyl group (-SO2-) in the chemical structure suggests that this molecule may have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains iodine atoms, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings containing the symbol "I". For example, in the third SMILES string, "C1=C(C=C(C(=C1I)OC2=CC(=C(C(=C2)I)O)I)I)CC(C(=O)O)N 0", the presence of two iodine atoms in the chemical structure suggests that this molecule may have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "Cc1ccccc1n2ccc(cc2)no2cnc3ccccc23" or "Cc1ccccc1n2ccc(cc2)no2cnc3ccccc23Nc4ccccc4". For example, in the last SMILES string, "CCCN(CCOC1=C(C=C(C=C1Cl)Cl)Cl)C(=O)N2C=CN=C2.C(S(=O)(=O)[O-])(I)I.[Na+] 0", the presence of the nitro group (-NO2) in the chemical structure suggests that this molecule may have the potential to cause adverse effects.
