It should be noted that this rule is not definitive as there could be other factors involved in causing such side effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with a nitro group (-NO2) or a cyano group (-CN) in their structures tend to have high reactivity and may pose safety concerns. The last three molecules in the table all contain one or both of these functional groups and they all have labels indicating their potential toxicity. However, it's important to note that these rules are general guidelines and should not be used as the sole basis for predicting the safety of a particular compound. Further testing and analysis would be necessary before making any conclusions about its safety.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects on the reproductive system or breast tissue. For example, the presence of chlorine atoms in the first SMILES string suggests that this molecule could have endocrine disrupting properties. Similarly, the presence of nitro groups in the fifth SMILES string indicates that this molecule could be toxic to the reproductive system.
Rule 2: The structure of a molecule can also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects. For instance, the second SMILES string contains a sulfonamide group which is known to be toxic to the reproductive system. Additionally, the third SMILES string contains a nitrile group which is highly reactive and could potentially interact with other molecules in the body.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule can also affect its toxicity. Longer and more complex molecules tend to have higher chances of interacting with other molecules in the body and causing adverse effects. This is evident from the sixth SMILES string which has a long carbon chain and several rings.
