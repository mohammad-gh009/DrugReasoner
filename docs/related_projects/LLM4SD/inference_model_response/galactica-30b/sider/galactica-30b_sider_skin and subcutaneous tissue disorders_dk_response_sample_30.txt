Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a carbonyl group (COR), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the first molecule in the dataset contains both a sulfonyl group and a carbonyl group, which suggests that it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" in the dataset. For example, the fifth molecule in the dataset contains a nitro group but does not appear to have any potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl) bonded to an aromatic ring, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule also applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" in the dataset. For example, the eighth molecule in the dataset contains a chlorine atom bonded to an aromatic ring but does not appear to have any potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have potential side effects related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 in the dataset.

Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), then it may have potential side effects related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a phosphate group (PO4R), it may have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues due to their irritant nature. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be labeled as having potential side effects in this category.
Example: C(CC(O)(P(=O)(O)O)P(=O)(O)O)CN has a phosphate group and therefore should be labeled as having potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Rule 2: Compounds containing iodine atoms may also have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues because they can act as disinfectants and antiseptics. Therefore, compounds containing iodine atoms should also be labeled as having potential side effects in this category.
Example: COC(=O)[C@@H]1[C@H]2CCC(N2CCCF)C[C@@H]1C3=CC=C(C=C3)I has an iodine atom and therefore should be labeled as having potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Rule 3: Compounds containing gadolinium ions (Gd3+) may also have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues due to their ability to cause allergic reactions. Therefore, compounds containing Gd3+ should also be labeled as having potential side effects in this category.
Example: [H+].[H+].CNC[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](CO)O)O)O)O.CNC[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](CO)O)O)O)O.C1=CC=C(C=C1)COCC(C(=O)[O-])N(CCN(CCN(CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-].[Gd+3] has a Gd3+ ion and therefore should be labeled as having potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) or carboxylic acid group (COOH) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Explanation: These functional groups can interact with proteins and enzymes present in the skin and subcutaneous tissues, leading to irritation, inflammation, and other adverse reactions.
Rule 2: A compound containing multiple rings or aromatic structures may have higher probability of causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues due to their ability to penetrate the skin barrier more easily than non-aromatic compounds.
Explanation: Aromatic rings can form π-π interactions with protein molecules, which can lead to increased binding affinity and toxicity.
Rule 3: Compounds containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine may also be associated with increased risk of adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. This may be due to their ability to disrupt cellular processes by interacting with proteins and enzymes.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. This rule applies to compounds C16, C78, C80, C81, C82, C83, C84, C85, C86, C87, C88, C89, C90, C91, C92, C93, C94, C95, C96, C97, C98, C99, and C100.
Rule 2: If a compound has a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom in its structure, then it may also have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. This rule applies to compounds C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C13, C14, C15, C16, C17, C18, C19, C20, C21, C22, C23, C24, C25, C26, C27, C28, C29, C30, C31, C32, C33, C34, C35, C36, C37, C38, C39, C40, C41, C42, C43, C44, C45, C46, C47, C48, C49, C50, C51, C52, C53, C54, C55, C56, C57, C58, C59, C60, C61, C62, C63, C64, C65, C66, C67, C68, C69, C70, C71, C72, C73, C74, C75, C76, C77, C78, C79, C80, C81, C82, C83, C84, C85, C86, C87, C88, C89, C90, C91, C92, C93, C94, C95, C96, C97, C98, C99, and C100.
Rule 3: If a compound has a carbonyl group (-C=O) adjacent to a double bond, then it may also have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. The presence of these functional groups indicates that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in cellular processes such as inflammation, which can lead to adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) attached to a carbon atom, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Halogen atoms can alter the chemical properties of molecules and affect their interactions with other molecules, including those involved in cellular processes.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen-containing ring structure, such as a pyridine or pyrimidine ring, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Nitrogen-containing rings are commonly found in drugs and other chemicals that interact with biological systems, and they can play important roles in modulating protein-ligand interactions. However, it's worth noting that these rules are based on limited information and should be used cautiously when predicting the potential toxicity of new compounds.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of chlorine atoms in the structure of the molecule, then it may have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. The presence of halogen atoms like chlorine can increase the lipophilicity of the compound which can lead to increased penetration through the stratum corneum layer of the skin. This can result in irritation or allergic reactions. Therefore, molecules containing chlorine should be carefully evaluated for their potential side effects on these tissues.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. Nitro compounds can cause skin sensitization, irritation, and corrosion due to their oxidizing nature. They can also act as photosensitizers leading to phototoxicity. Therefore, molecules containing nitro groups should also be carefully evaluated for their potential side effects on these tissues.
Rule 3: If the molecule has a carbonyl group (-C=O) present in its structure, then it may have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. Carbonyl compounds can react with amino acids and proteins resulting in protein cross-linking and denaturation. This can lead to inflammation and tissue damage. Therefore, molecules containing carbonyl groups should also be carefully evaluated for their potential side effects on these tissues.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) in the structure may indicate potential skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders as a side effect. This rule applies to the first SMILES string provided.
Rule 2: If there is a fluorine atom present on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group in the second SMILES string, it may increase the likelihood of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders as a side effect. However, this rule needs further validation through experimentation or clinical trials.
Rule 3: A sulfhydryl group (-SH) attached to a peptide bond in the fourth SMILES string may suggest potential skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders as a side effect. However, this rule also requires experimental verification.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a sulfate group (-OSO3-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72,

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a carbonyl group (COR), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the first molecule in the dataset contains both a sulfonyl group and a carbonyl group, which suggests that it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" in the dataset. For example, the fifth molecule in the dataset contains a nitro group but does not appear to have any potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl) bonded to an aromatic ring, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule also applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" in the dataset. For example, the eighth molecule in the dataset contains a chlorine atom bonded to an aromatic ring but does not appear to have any potential to cause adverse effects in relation to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carboxylic acid or its derivatives, amides, esters, and sulfoxides in a compound may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Explanation: These functional groups have the potential to irritate the skin and mucous membranes due to their acidic or basic nature, which can lead to inflammation and other adverse reactions.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also be associated with increased risk of skin irritation and other adverse effects.
Explanation: These structural features can enhance the reactivity of the compound, making it more likely to interact with biological molecules and disrupt normal cellular processes.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and lipophilicity of a compound may also play a role in determining its ability to penetrate the skin and cause adverse effects. Compounds with higher molecular weights and lower octanol-water partition coefficients tend to be less lipophilic and may be less likely to penetrate the skin and cause adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. This rule applies to compounds C16, C78, C80, C81, C82, C83, C84, C85, C86, C87, C88, C89, C90, C91, C92, C93, C94, C95, C96, C97, C98, C99, and C100.
Rule 2: If a compound has a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom in its structure, then it may also have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.

Rule 3: If a compound has a carbonyl group (-C=O) adjacent to a double bond, then it may also have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. This rule applies to compounds C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C13, C14, C15, C16, C17, C18, C19, C20, C21, C22, C23, C24, C25, C26, C27, C28, C29, C30, C31, C32

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of bromine atoms in the molecular structure, then it may lead to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders as they are known to be toxic and can irritate the skin. Therefore, if a compound contains bromine atom(s), it should be labeled as 1 for potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Rule 2: If a compound has a nitro group (-NO2) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), it may have some reactivity towards other molecules which could potentially result in adverse reactions such as allergic reactions or toxicity. Hence, compounds containing these functional groups should also be labeled as 1 for possible side effects.
Rule 3: Compounds having aromatic rings in their structures tend to be more stable due to resonance stabilization but at the same time, they can also act as haptens and cause allergic reactions in certain individuals. Thus, compounds possessing aromatic ring(s) should also be considered as potential candidates for causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of sulfonamide group in a compound may increase its potential to cause skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to compounds with SMILES strings starting with "S(=O)(=O)O" or "SO2". For example, the first compound listed has a sulfonamide group and is labeled as having a side-effect activity related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 2: Compounds containing a nitro group (-NO2) may have a higher likelihood of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders if they also contain other functional groups such as aromatic rings or halogens. This rule applies to compounds with SMILES strings containing "NO2" along with other groups such as "C1=CC=CC=C1" or "Cl". For instance, the fifth compound listed contains both a nitro group and an aromatic ring, and is labeled as having a side-effect activity related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
Rule 3: Compounds containing conjugated double bonds or carbonyl groups may have a lower risk of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders compared to those without these functionalities. This rule applies to compounds with SMILES strings containing "C=C" or "C=O". For example, the last two compounds listed do not contain any sulfonamide or nitro groups but still have no reported side effects related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in a compound increases its likelihood of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders as a side effect. This rule applies to compounds with SMILES strings starting with "CCSNC1ccc2nnc(n2cccn1)Sc2ccccc2" or "CCONHC1ccc2nnc(n2cccn1)Sc2ccccc2".
Rule 2: Compounds containing a nitro group (-NO2) have a higher chance of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders if they also contain a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine attached to a carbon atom adjacent to the nitro group. This rule applies to compounds with SMILES strings starting with "CC1=C(C(=NO2)C3=C(C=CC=C3Br)F)C(=O)NC3C4N(C3=O)C(C(S4)(C)C)C(=O)O" or "CC1=C(C(=NO2)C2=C(C=CC=C2Cl)F)C(=O)NC3C4N(C3=O)C(C(S4)(C)C)C(=O)O".
Rule 3: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a sulfur atom bonded to another non-hydrogen atom, then it has a high probability of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This rule applies to compounds with SMILES strings starting with "CCNS(=O

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of halogen atoms like chlorine or bromine in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on human health due to their high reactivity. Therefore, molecules containing these elements should be labeled as 1.
Example: Label 1 for CC1=CC(=C(N1)C=C2C3=CC=CC=C3NC2=O)C because it contains one chlorine atom.
Rule 2: If the molecule has a functional group such as nitro or carbonyl groups, they can cause allergic reactions or irritation to the skin and tissues. Hence, molecules having these groups should also be labeled as 1.
Example: Label 1 for C1=CC(=CC=C1CSC(CN2C=CN=C2)C3=C(C=C(C=C3)Cl)Cl)Cl because it possesses a nitro group.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a heterocyclic ring system, it may have some biological activities which could affect its toxicity level. For example, if the molecule contains a pyridine ring, it may act as a chelating agent and bind to metal ions, leading to potential toxic effects. Thus, molecules possessing this type of rings should be labeled as 1.
Example: Label 1 for CCCNS(=O)(=O)NC1=C(C(=NC=N1)OCCOC2=NC=C(C=N2)Br)C3=CC=C(C=C3)Br because it contains a pyridine ring.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amides, and amines in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. These functional groups can interact with proteins or other molecules in the body, leading to irritation or inflammation.
Rule 2: A compound containing halogen atoms such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine may also have the potential to cause adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. Halogen atoms can act as electrophilic agents, reacting with nucleophilic sites on proteins or other molecules in the body, leading to cell damage or death.
Rule 3: Compounds containing sulfur or phosphorus atoms may also be associated with adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. Sulfur-containing compounds such as sulfoxides and sulfones can irritate the skin and mucous membranes, while phosphorous-containing compounds such as phosphoric acid and its derivatives can cause burns and irritation.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in a compound increases its likelihood of causing skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders as a side effect. This rule applies to compounds with SMILES strings starting with "CCSNC1ccc2nnc(n2cccn1)Sc2ccccc2" or "CCONHC1ccc2nnc(n2cccn1)Sc2ccccc2".

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, nitro, or carbonyl groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Explanation: These functional groups can interact with proteins and enzymes in the body, leading to irritation or inflammation of the skin.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues due to their ability to absorb UV light and generate free radicals.
Explanation: Exposure to sunlight or artificial sources of UV radiation can exacerbate any pre-existing skin conditions caused by these compounds.
Rule 3: Compounds with high molecular weight or complex structures may be less likely to penetrate the skin and cause adverse effects compared to simpler molecules. However, they may still pose a risk if they are present in high concentrations or under certain environmental conditions.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (C=O) in its structure, then it may have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If a compound has a functional group such as a double bond or triple bond between carbon atoms, it may also have potential side effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1.
Rule 3: If a compound contains nitrogen atoms in its structure, especially in the form of a heterocyclic ring, it may be more likely to cause adverse reactions than other types of molecules. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings labeled as either 0 or 1, but it is important to note that this rule alone does not guarantee that the compound will cause any specific side effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, nitro, or carbonyl groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to bind to proteins and enzymes in the body, which can lead to irritation or inflammation of these tissues.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also be associated with increased risk of adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Explanation: These structural features can enhance the reactivity of the compound, making it more likely to interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions.
Rule 3: Compounds with molecular weights greater than 500 Daltons may have lower bioavailability and penetration into skin and subcutaneous tissues, resulting in reduced likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Explanation: Larger compounds may have slower absorption rates and less efficient transport across cell membranes compared to smaller ones, reducing their potential to cause harm.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of gadolinium ion in the molecular structure indicates potential for causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Rule 2: A molecule containing chlorine atoms may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues compared to molecules without chlorine atoms.
Rule 3: Molecules containing functional groups such as carbonyl, carboxyl, or nitro groups may be more likely to cause adverse effects on skin and subcutaneous tissues than those without these groups.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a nitro group (-NO2) present in the structure of the molecule, then it may cause adverse effects on the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The presence of this functional group increases the polarity of the molecule which makes it more reactive towards biological systems leading to toxic effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may also cause adverse effects on the skin and subcutaneous tissues. This functional group is known for its antimicrobial property but at higher concentrations, it can lead to allergic reactions or irritation.
Rule 3: If the molecule has a benzene ring attached to it through a carbonyl group (-CO-), then it may have potential adverse effects on the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Benzene rings are known to be carcinogenic and can cause skin irritation when exposed to sunlight.
