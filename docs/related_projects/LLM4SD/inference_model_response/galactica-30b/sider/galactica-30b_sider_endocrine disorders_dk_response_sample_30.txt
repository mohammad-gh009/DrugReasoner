Rule 1: If there exists a functional group such as carbonyl or carboxyl in the structure of a molecule, then it may have potential side effects on endocrine disorders. The presence of these groups indicates that the compound could be metabolized into active compounds which might interfere with hormone production and regulation. For example, in the first SMILES string, the molecule contains both ketone and ester groups, which suggests that it has the potential to interact with hormones involved in endocrine function.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a heterocyclic ring system, especially nitrogen-containing rings like pyridine or pyrimidine, it may also exhibit endocrine disrupting activities. These types of structures are often found in pharmaceutical drugs and can bind to receptors in the body, potentially interfering with normal hormonal signaling pathways. For instance, in the second SMILES string, the molecule contains a benzimidazole ring, which is known for its biological activity and medicinal applications.
Rule 3: Molecules containing halogen atoms, particularly chlorine or bromine, may have higher probabilities of causing adverse effects due to their ability to disrupt protein-ligand interactions within the body. Halogenated compounds are commonly used in industrial processes and can accumulate in the environment, leading to potential health risks. For example, in the sixth SMILES string, the molecule contains two chlorine atoms, which may increase its likelihood of interacting with proteins involved in endocrine function.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a compound may indicate its potential to cause endocrine disorders as seen in the first SMILES string. Sulfonamides are known to interfere with hormone production and can lead to various health problems including thyroid dysfunction, insulin resistance, and obesity.
Rule 2: A compound containing a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring may also have the potential to cause endocrine disorders due to its ability to disrupt hormonal signaling pathways. Nitro compounds are known to interact with estrogen receptors and can lead to reproductive abnormalities such as infertility or birth defects.
Rule 3: Compounds containing conjugated double bonds and carbonyl groups may be more likely to cause adverse effects on the endocrine system compared to those without these functional groups. Conjugated double bonds increase the lipophilicity of a compound which allows for easier penetration into cells and tissues while carbonyl groups can form hydrogen bonds with proteins and enzymes leading to altered function.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three possible rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a similar functional group, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the first molecule listed above contains a sulfonamide group and was labeled as "1".
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group (-C=O) through a single bond, then it may not have side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" in the dataset. For example, the second molecule listed above contains such a structure and was labeled as "0".
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a guanidine group (-C(NH2)=NNHC(=O)) or a similar functional group, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the third molecule listed above contains a guanidine group and was labeled as "1".

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a cyano group (-CN) and a sulfonamide group (-SO2NR2), then it may have potential side effects associated with endocrine disorders. The presence of these functional groups in the chemical compound suggests that it could interfere with hormone production or function, leading to hormonal imbalances and potentially harmful health consequences.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a conjugated system of double bonds between two aromatic rings, such as in the case of coumarin derivatives, then it may also exhibit endocrine disrupting activities. Coumarins are known to bind to estrogen receptors and disrupt normal estrogenic signaling pathways, leading to reproductive abnormalities and other health problems.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may be potentially toxic and carcinogenic due to its ability to form DNA adducts and induce mutations. Nitro compounds are known to be potent mutagens and carcinogens, and their exposure has been linked to various types of cancer in humans.

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a benzene ring, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The first example in the dataset satisfies this rule.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a pyridine ring (a six-membered aromatic heterocycle with one nitrogen atom), then it may not have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The second example in the dataset does not satisfy this rule because it contains a pyrimidine ring instead of a pyridine ring.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may not have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The third example in the dataset does not satisfy this rule because there is no such fluorine atom present.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The first example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains both groups. However, note that this rule alone cannot guarantee that the molecule will have such side effects since other factors like dosage, metabolism, and individual susceptibility also play a role.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a double bond between two carbon atoms, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The second example in the dataset satisfies this rule but again, this rule alone does not guarantee that the molecule will have such side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (-C6H5) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in its structure, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. The third example in the dataset satisfies this rule but once again, this rule alone does not guarantee that the molecule will have such side effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a benzene ring in a compound may increase its potential for causing endocrine disorders as seen in SMILES strings labeled 1 and 9.
Rule 2: A compound containing a sulfonamide group may have a higher likelihood of causing endocrine disorders as seen in SMILES string labeled 8.
Rule 3: A compound containing a nitro group may also be associated with increased risk of endocrine disruption as seen in SMILES string labeled 7.

================================

Rule 2: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5) or a naphthalene ring (C10H8) in its structure, then it may not have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 0 in the provided dataset. For example, the second molecule listed in the dataset contains a benzene ring but no sulfonyl or carbonyl groups, which suggests that it may not have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to at least two carbon atoms, then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders.

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 in the provided dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), then it may also have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules such as C(C(CO)O)O, COC1=C2C(=CC(=C1N3CC4CCCNC4C3)F)C(=O)C(=CN2C5CC5)C(=O)O, CCC(C)CCCCC(=O)NC(CCN)C(=O)NC(C(C)O)C(=O)NC(CCN)C(=O)NC1CCNC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC1=O)CCN)CC2=CC=CC=C2)CC(C)C)CCN)CCN)C(C)O, CC(C)(C)C(=O)OCOP(=O)(COCCN1C=NC2=C1N=CN=C2N)OCOC(=O)C(C)(C)C, CCSSCC(C(=O)NP(=O)(OP1(=O)

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional groups such as amines or amides in a compound, then it may have potential side effects on the endocrine system. This rule can be applied to the first and third SMILES strings where the compounds contain amine groups which could potentially lead to endocrine disruption.
Rule 2: If a compound contains aromatic rings, it may also contribute to its ability to disrupt the endocrine system. The second and fifth SMILES strings contain benzene rings which could increase their likelihood of causing endocrine disruptions.
Rule 3: A compound containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine may also pose a risk for disrupting the endocrine system. The sixth SMILES string contains both chlorine and fluoride atoms which could potentially interact with hormones and affect their function.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a thiocarbonyl group (=S) in conjugation with a double bond or aromatic ring, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the dataset. For example, the first molecule in the dataset contains a thiocarbonyl group conjugated with a double bond and is labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (=O) adjacent to a carbon-carbon double bond, then it may not have side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 0 in the dataset. For example, the second molecule in the dataset contains a carbonyl group adjacent to a carbon-carbon double bond and is labeled as 0.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule also applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the dataset. For example, the third molecule in the dataset contains a cyano group attached to an aromatic ring and is labeled as 1.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels of 0 indicating no known association with endocrine disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (-C=O) through a single bond, then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This structural feature appears in the third molecule in the dataset which also has a label of 0.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to four other atoms including one carbon atom, then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. This structural feature appears in the fourth molecule in the dataset which also has a label of 0.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided by the given dataset and should be treated as preliminary suggestions only. Further research and analysis would be needed to confirm their validity and applicability to a wider range of compounds and conditions.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to endocrine disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a benzene ring (-C6H5), then it is more likely to have side-effects related to endocrine disorders. This is based on the fact that molecules containing these functional groups appear in both labeled compounds (with labels 1 and 0) but not in any unlabeled ones. However, this rule alone may not be sufficient to make accurate predictions since there are also other labeled compounds without these functional groups.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a pyridine ring (-C5H5N), then it is less likely to have side-effects related to endocrine disorders. This is based on the fact that none of the labeled compounds contain both of these functional groups. Therefore, if a new compound contains both of these functional groups, it is less likely to have side-effects related to endocrine disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) and a phenyl group (-C6H5), then it is more likely to have side-effects related to endocrine disorders. This is based on the fact that all four labeled compounds containing a sulfonyl group also contain a phenyl group. Therefore, if a new compound contains only one of these functional groups, it is less likely to have side-effects related to endocrine disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it may have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. The presence of this functional group in certain drugs such as glipizide and glyburide has been linked to increased risk of hypoglycemia and other endocrine-related complications.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. Nitro compounds are known to interfere with hormone production and metabolism, which can lead to various health problems including thyroid dysfunction and diabetes.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it may also have potential side effects related to endocrine disorders. Cyano compounds have been shown to disrupt hormonal balance and affect glucose metabolism, leading to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing endocrine disorders as a side effect. For example, the molecule containing the sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) has been known to cause endocrine disruption by mimicking hormones and interfering with their normal function. Therefore, if a molecule contains this or similar functional groups, it should be labeled as having potential for endocrine disorder activity.
Rule 2: The molecular structure and geometry play a significant role in determining the biological activity of a compound. A molecule with a planar structure and rigid conformation may have higher affinity towards specific receptors than one with a flexible structure. Additionally, the length and flexibility of the carbon chain may also affect the interaction between the molecule and its target receptor. Therefore, molecules with such structural features should be considered more likely to exhibit endocrine disrupting activities.
Rule 3: The charge distribution on a molecule affects its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with cellular components. Molecules with polar functional groups like hydroxyl (-OH), carboxyl (-COOH), and amino (-NH2) groups tend to carry a net negative or positive charge depending on the pH of the solution. These charged molecules may have better membrane permeability and binding affinity towards specific targets compared to neutral ones. Therefore, compounds with these types of functional groups should be evaluated carefully for their potential to disrupt hormonal balance.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to endocrine disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chloride ion (Cl-) or a zinc atom (Zn) in its structure, then it is likely to have side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms (-N=C=C-), then it is unlikely to have side effects related to endocrine disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 0 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (-C6H5) or a naphthalene ring (-C10H7), then it may have side effects related to endocrine disorders. However, this rule is less certain than Rule 1 and Rule 2 because some molecules containing these rings do not have any reported side effects while others do. Therefore, additional factors such as the concentration and duration of exposure must also be considered when predicting the toxicity of a molecule.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like sulfonamide or nitro group in the structure of a molecule, then it may have potential to cause adverse effects on human health due to its ability to inhibit enzymes involved in various metabolic processes. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: Molecules having aromatic rings and halogen atoms such as fluorine, chlorine etc. may also pose some risk for causing adverse effects because they can interact with biological macromolecules leading to changes in their function. Hence, it is advisable to avoid using them in drug design unless necessary.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure play a significant role in determining its toxicity. Longer chains and more complex structures tend to increase the likelihood of unwanted interactions within the body. Therefore, it is important to keep the molecular size and complexity under control while designing new drugs.

Therefore, additional factors such as the concentration and duration of exposure must also be considered when predicting the toxicity of a molecule.
