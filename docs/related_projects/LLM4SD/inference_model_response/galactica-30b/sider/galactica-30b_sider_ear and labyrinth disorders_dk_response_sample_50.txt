Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and are labeled as having adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders. The fourth molecule in the dataset contains this group and is labeled as not having adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders. The last four molecules in the dataset contain these atoms and are labeled as not having adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The first molecule in the dataset contains a nitro group and is labeled as having no such potential. Therefore, this rule would need to be further tested for accuracy before being used as a predictive tool.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The second molecule in the dataset contains a sulfonyl group and is labeled as having no such potential. However, since there is only one example of a molecule containing a sulfonyl group in the dataset, this rule should also be further tested for accuracy before being used as a predictive tool.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The fifth molecule in the dataset contains a chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring and is labeled as having no such potential. This rule appears to be more reliable than Rules 1 and 2 based on the limited number of examples in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a negatively charged ion such as Gd+3 or In-, then it has a high probability of causing ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule can be applied to compounds C1 through C8.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a benzene ring, then it may have a higher chance of causing ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule can be applied to compounds B1 and D1.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a fluorine atom bonded to carbon in a five-membered ring, then it may have a lower risk of causing ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule can be applied to compound A1.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and a conjugated double bond system, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings C1=CC(=C(C=C1N/N=C/2\C=CC(=O)C(=C2)C(=O)O)C(=O)O)O and CCC1=C2C=C3C(=C(C(=CC4=NC(=CC5=NC(=CC(=C1C)N2)C(=C5CCC(=O)O)C)C(=C4C)CCC(=O)O)N3)C(C)O)C.[Na+] 1.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms and a chlorine atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings CN1C2=C(C=C(C=C2)Cl)C(=NC(C1=O)O)C3=CC=CC=C3Cl 1 and CNC1(CCCCC1=O)C2=CC=CC=C2Cl 0.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (SO2) and a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings CC1=CN(C(=O)C=C1)C2=CC=CC=C2 0 and C(CC(C(=O)O)N)CN=C(N)N 0.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of sulfur atom in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on ears or labyrinth disorder. The given SMILES strings containing sulfur atoms are CC(CN1C2=CC=CC=C2SC3=C1C=C(C=C3)OC)CN(C)C, CCOC(=O)C1(CCN(CC1)C)C2=CC=CC=C2, CCC(C)C1C(=O)NC(C(=O)NC(C(=O)NC(CSSCC(C(=O)NC(C(=O)N1)CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)N)C(=O)N3CCCC3C(=O)NC(CC(C)C)C(=O)NCC(=O)N)CC(=O)N)CCC(=O)N, which have been labeled as 0 indicating no association with ear or labyrinth disorder. Therefore, this rule cannot be applied for these molecules. However, if we consider other molecules without any sulfur atom present such as CCOC(=O)O[C@@]1(CCC2[C@@]1(C[C@@H](C3C2CCC4=CC(=O)C=C[C@]34C)O)C)C(=O)OCCl, C1C(C

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a compound increases its likelihood of causing ear and labyrinth disorders as seen in SMILES strings labeled 1 for compounds C[C@H]1/C=C/C=C(\C(=O)NC\2=C(C3=C(C(=C4C(=C3C(=O)/C2=C/NN5CCN(CC5)C)C(=O)[C@](O4)(O/C=C/[C@@H]([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H]1O)C)O)C)OC(=O)C)C)OC)C)C)O)O)/C and CC(C(CN1C=NC=N1)(C2=C(C=C(C=C2)F)F)O)N3CCC(=C)CC3.
Rule 2: Compounds containing a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) have a higher chance of causing ear and labyrinth disorders as seen in SMILES strings labeled 1 for CN1CCN(CC1)C(C2=CC=CC=C2)C3=CC=CC=C3 and CCC(CSc1ccc(cc1Cl)I)Oc1ccccc1Br.
Rule

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders. The presence of a chlorine atom in a molecule often indicates that it is highly reactive and may interact with other molecules or ions in the body, potentially causing harm.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen-containing ring structure, such as a pyridine or pyrimidine group, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders. Nitrogen-containing rings are commonly found in drugs and other chemicals that can cause adverse reactions in the body.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders. Sulfonyl groups are commonly found in medications like aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which can cause irritation and inflammation in the ears and surrounding tissues.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure CCC1=NC=CC(=C1)C(=S)N, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule was derived from the first SMILES string labeled as 1. The presence of this substructure suggests that the molecule may have a thiol group which is known to be toxic and can cause damage to the inner ear.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure C1[C@H]([C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O1)O[C@@H]2CO[C@H]([C@@H]([C@H]2OS(=O)(=O)O)OS(=O)(=O)O)O)OS(=O)(=O)O)OS(=O)(=O)O)O, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule was derived from the second SMILES string labeled as 1. The presence of this substructure suggests that the molecule may contain a sugar moiety which can cause irritation to the ear.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains the substructure CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=C(N

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to a benzene ring, it may have potential side effects on ears or labyrinths. The given SMILES string C1[C@H](CN2[C@@H]1C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C2=O)CC3=CC=CC=C3)CC4=CC=C(C=C4)OCC5=CC=CC=C5)CCCCN)CC6=CNC7=CC=CC=C76)C8=CC=CC=C8)OC(=O)NCCN 1 satisfies this rule as it has a cyano group connected to a benzene ring through a single bond.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in its structure, it may not be safe for human consumption due to its acidic nature. The given SMILES strings CC(=O)NCCC1=CC=CC2=C1C=C(C=C2)OC 1 and C(C(C(=O)[O-])[S-])C(=O)[O-].[Na+].[Na+].[Au+] 0 satisfy this rule since they contain a carboxylic acid group. However, note that this does not necessarily mean that these compounds will cause any adverse effects if consumed.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) in its structure, it may also not be safe for human consumption due to its acidity. The given SMILES string CC(C(C(=O)[O-])[S-])C(=O)[O-].[Na+].[Na+].[Au+] 0 satisfies this rule because it contains a sulfonic acid group. Again, caution should be exercised when consuming such compounds.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The first example in the dataset contains both these groups and is labeled as having the potential to cause such effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The second example in the dataset contains this group and is labeled as having the potential to cause such effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a guanidine group (-CN3), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The third example in the dataset contains this group and is labeled as having the potential to cause such effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels of 1, indicating that they do have this potential.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to a double bond, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains this structure and it has a label of 1, indicating that it does have this potential.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, including at least one carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule applies to the fourth molecule in the dataset, which has a label of 1.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided by the given dataset and should be treated as preliminary suggestions only. Further research would be needed to confirm their validity and applicability to other types of molecules and conditions.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a benzene ring (represented by the SMILES string C1=CC=C(C=C1)), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule applies to molecules 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62,

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a benzene ring or other aromatic rings, it may have potential side effects on ears and labyrinths. The first two molecules in the dataset contain such structures and they both have label 1 indicating their association with ear and labyrinth disorders.
Rule 2: Compounds containing nitrogen atoms may also be associated with ear and labyrinth disorders. The third molecule in the dataset has a nitrogen atom and its label is 1 as well.
Rule 3: If a compound contains fluorine atoms, it may not cause any adverse effects on ears and labyrinths. The sixth molecule in the dataset has a fluorine atom but its label is 0, which indicates no relationship between this molecule and ear and labyrinth disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a thiosulfonate group (-SOS-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders. The presence of these groups indicates that the molecule may interact with biological systems in ways that could lead to negative health outcomes.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders. Nitro groups are known to be toxic and can interfere with normal cellular processes.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders. Halogen atoms can alter the chemical properties of molecules and affect their interactions with other substances.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of fluorine atom in the structure, then it may lead to ear and labyrinth disorders as seen in SMILES string number 1. Fluorine has high electronegativity which can affect the electronic configuration of nearby atoms leading to potential toxicity.
Rule 2: If there is a presence of nitrogen atom bonded to carbon in the structure, then it may also lead to ear and labyrinth disorders as seen in SMILES strings numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 respectively. Nitrogen is highly reactive and can form hydrogen bonds or interact with other molecules affecting their function.
Rule 3: If there is a presence of sulfur atom in the structure, then it may not necessarily lead to ear and labyrinth disorders as seen in SMILES strings numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 respectively. Sulfur is less toxic than nitrogen but still can have some effects on biological systems depending on its position and bonding within the molecular structure.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a functional group such as NCCN in the molecular structure may indicate potential side effects associated with ear and labyrinth disorders. This functional group is commonly found in drugs used for treating hearing loss or vertigo.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to another carbon atom through a single bond (C-C) may also be associated with potential side effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This type of bonding pattern is common in organic compounds known as aldehydes and ketones, which have been linked to various health problems including hearing loss and dizziness.
Rule 3: Molecules containing halogen atoms such as chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br) may also pose a risk of causing adverse effects on the ear and labyrinth. These elements are often present in industrial chemicals and pesticides that have been shown to damage the auditory system.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure "CC(C)(C)NOC(=O)C1CN(CCN1CC(CC(CC2=CC=CC=C2)C(=O)NC3C(CC4=CC=CC=C34)O)O)CC5=CN=CC=C5" then it is likely to have side-effect activity related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule is based on the second SMILES string provided in the dataset which contains this specific substructure and has been labeled as having such activity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure "CC1CC2C3CCC(C3(CC(C2C4(C1=CC(=O)C=C4)C)O)C)(C(=O)COC(=O)CCC(=O)O)O" then it is also likely to have side-effect activity related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule is based on the third SMILES string provided in the dataset which contains this specific substructure and has been labeled as having such activity.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains the substructure "C1CC1N2C=C(C(=O)C3=CC(=C(C=C32)N4CCNCC4)F)C(=O)O" then it may have some potential for causing adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. However, this rule is less certain than Rules 1 and 2 since only one molecule containing this substructure was present in the dataset and it had no associated labels. Further research would be needed to confirm its potential toxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, then it may have potential side effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The first four molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they all have labels of 1 indicating their association with such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) in its structure, then it may also have potential side effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The fifth molecule in the dataset contains this group and it has a label of 1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl) in its structure, then it may not have any significant side effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The last two molecules in the dataset contain this group but they both have labels of 0.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule applies to molecules 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset, such as CNS(=O)(=O)CC1=CC2=C(C=C1)NC=C2CCN(C)C 1 and C1=C(C(=C(C(=C1Cl)Cl)CC2=C(C(=CC(=C2Cl)Cl)Cl)O)O)Cl 0.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group (-C=O) through two carbon atoms, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset, such as CC(=O)OC1CC2CCC3C(C2(CC1[N+]4(CCCCC4)C)C)CCC5(C3CC(C5OC(=O)C)[N+]6(CCCCC6)C)C 0 and CCCCCCCCC(=O)CCC1C(CC(C1CC=CCCCC(=O)

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a phosphorus atom bonded to two oxygen atoms and one carbon atom, then it may have side-effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The SMILES string for this structure is C[C@H]1[C@H](O1)P(=O)(O)[O-]. This rule applies only to the first molecule listed in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to three carbon atoms in a ring structure, then it may not have any side-effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The SMILES string for this structure is C(=NC(=N)N)(N)N. This rule applies only to the second molecule listed in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring connected to a cyclopentane ring through a carbonyl group, then it may have side-effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The SMILES string for this structure is CC(C)(C1=CC=CC=C1CCC(C2=CC=CC(=C2)C=CC3=NC4=C(C=CC(=C4)Cl)C=C3)SCC5(CC5)CC(=O)O)O. This rule applies only to the third molecule listed in the dataset.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The presence of these groups indicates that the molecule may interact with biological molecules such as enzymes and proteins, which can lead to unwanted reactions within the body.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5) or a naphthalene ring (C10H8), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. These rings are commonly found in many pharmaceutical compounds and can contribute to their toxicity by interacting with biological molecules and disrupting normal cellular processes.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. Chlorine atoms are often used in drug design to modify the physical and chemical properties of molecules, but they do not necessarily indicate that the compound will be toxic.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels of 1, indicating their potential to cause such effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to a benzene ring, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains this feature and it has a label of 1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule applies to the fourth molecule in the dataset, which has a label of 1.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided by the given dataset and should be treated as preliminary suggestions only. Further research and analysis would be needed to confirm their validity and applicability to other types of molecules and conditions.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a benzene ring or a similar aromatic system, it may have side effects on the ears and labyrinth organs. This rule applies to molecules such as "CCCCN1CCCCC1C(=O)NC2=C(C=CC=C2C)C F 0" and "CC1=C(C2=C(N1C(=O)C3=CC=C(C=C3)Cl)C=CC(=C2)OC)CC(=O)O 1".
Rule 2: If a compound has a functional group like -COOH or -CONH-, it may affect the blood circulation and lead to adverse reactions in certain parts of the body including the ears and labyrinth organs. This rule applies to molecules such as "CC1=NC(=O)C2=C(N1)C=CC(=C2)CN(C)C3=CC=C(S3)C(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(=O)O)C(=O)O CC1=CC(=C(C=C1)O)O CCC(=O)OC(C(C)C)OP(=O)(CCCCC1=CC=CC=C1)CC(=O)N2CC(CC2C(=O)[O-])C3CCCCC3 1 C1=CC=C(C(=C1)C(=O)OC2=CC=CC=C2C(=O)O)O 1" and "C1CNN2C(=CC=C2C(=O)C3=CC=CC=C3)C1C(=O)O.C(C(CO)(CO)N)O 1".
Rule 3: If a compound contains a heterocyclic ring structure with nitrogen atoms, it may also have potential side effects on the ears and labyrinth organs. This rule applies to molecules such as "CC(CC1=CC(=C(C=C1)O)O)(C(=O)O)NN 0" and "CC12CCC3C(C1CCC2O)CCC4=C3C=CC(=C4)O 1".

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of sulfur in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on ears or labyrinths. The given SMILES strings with labels 1 have sulfur atoms present in their structures while those with label 0 do not. Therefore, this rule can be used as a preliminary screening tool for identifying potential molecules causing such adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a conjugated system of double bonds, it may also contribute to the adverse effects on ears or labyrinths. This is because conjugation increases the stability of the molecule but reduces its reactivity towards biological systems. Hence, if a molecule has a high degree of conjugation, it may be less likely to interact with the target receptors leading to these adverse effects. However, further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.
Rule 3: A molecule containing a nitro group (-NO2) may cause adverse effects on ears or labyrinths due to its strong oxidizing property. The given SMILES string with label 1 contains a nitro group whereas none of the other SMILES strings contain any nitro groups. Therefore, this rule can be used as another screening tool for identifying potentially harmful molecules.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain such a bond and they both have labels of 1, indicating that they do have this potential. However, the third molecule does not contain any chlorine atoms and therefore does not have this potential.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The fourth molecule in the dataset contains such a group and it has a label of 1, indicating that it does have this potential. However, the fifth molecule does not contain any nitro groups and therefore does not have this potential.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The sixth molecule in the dataset contains such a group and it has a label of 1, indicating that it does have this potential. However, the seventh molecule does not contain any sulfonyl groups and therefore does not have this potential.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amides, and amines in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the ear and labyrinth. These functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions.
Rule 2: A compound containing multiple rings or aromatic systems may also have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on the ear and labyrinth due to their ability to penetrate cell membranes and bind to proteins.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a compound's structure may also play a role in determining its toxicity. Longer chains and more complex structures may make it harder for the body to break down and eliminate the compound, leading to accumulation and increased risk of adverse effects.

Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) attached to an aliphatic chain, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels of 1, indicating that they do have this potential.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains chlorine atoms or other halogens, it may have side effects on ears and labyrinths. The presence of these elements in the chemical compound increases its potential for causing harm to the auditory system due to their ability to disrupt normal cell function.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) has a high probability of causing hearing loss if it enters the bloodstream. Sulfonamides are known to be ototoxic and can damage the inner ear's sensory cells responsible for transmitting sound waves. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should be carefully evaluated for possible side effects on the auditory system.
Rule 3: Molecules containing aromatic rings such as benzene or pyridine may also pose a risk of damaging the auditory system. These structures can interact with proteins and enzymes in the body, leading to cellular damage and inflammation. As a result, compounds containing these moieties should be closely monitored for any signs of toxicity to the auditory system.

Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to one carbon atom and one oxygen atom, as in CCON1C=C(C(=O)C2=CC(=C(C=C21)N3CCNCC3)F)C(=O)O, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule is based on the fact that many organic molecules containing nitro groups (-NO2) have been shown to exhibit toxicity and can cause tissue damage.

Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. None of the molecules in the dataset contain a carboxylic acid group, so no conclusions can be drawn from this rule.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule applies to compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule applies to compounds 5, 6, 7, 8, and 17.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to a nitrogen atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule applies to compounds 18, 19, and 20.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the dataset and should be used as a starting point for further investigation rather than definitive conclusions.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and nitro groups in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on ears and labyrinths.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to adverse reactions. For example, the sulfonyl group present in the first SMILES string has been associated with hearing loss and tinnitus.
Rule 2: A molecule containing halogen atoms such as fluorine or chlorine may also increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on ears and labyrinths.
Explanation: Halogen atoms can alter the chemical and physical properties of a molecule, affecting its reactivity and bioavailability. They can also form hydrogen bonds with biological molecules, disrupting their normal functions. For instance, the second SMILES string contains two fluorine atoms and has been linked to ototoxicity.
Rule 3: A molecule with a heterocyclic ring structure may be more likely to cause adverse effects on ears and labyrinths than one without.
Explanation: Heterocyclic rings contain at least one atom other than carbon in the ring structure, which can affect the molecule's electronic and steric properties. Some examples of heterocycles found in drugs that can cause ototoxicity include thiazole, imidazole, and pyridine.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels of 1, indicating that they do have this potential.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to a double bond, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule applies to the third molecule in the dataset, which has a label of 1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group through a single bond, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule applies to the last four molecules in the dataset, all of which have labels of 0.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of iodine atoms in the molecular structure, then it may lead to ear and labyrinth disorders as they are known to have toxic effects on the body's organs including ears and labyrinths. Therefore, molecules containing iodines should be labeled as 1 for potential side-effects associated with these disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a carbonyl group (C=O) or a sulfonyl group (SO2R), then it may also contribute to ear and labyrinth disorders due to their irritant nature towards the skin and mucous membranes. Hence, such structures should also be labeled as 1 for potential side-effects.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure has a nitro group (NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may cause irritation to the eyes, skin, and respiratory system leading to adverse reactions like asthma attacks etc. Such structures should therefore be labeled as 1 for potential side-effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it is likely to have side-effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The presence of these functional groups may increase the permeability of the blood-labyrinth barrier, leading to inflammation and other adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as bromine (Br) or iodine (I), then it is unlikely to have side-effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. Halogen atoms are often used in drug design for their ability to enhance metabolic stability and improve pharmacokinetic properties. However, they may also increase the risk of off-target interactions and toxicity.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds between carbon atoms, then it is likely to have side-effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. Conjugated systems can facilitate electron transfer reactions and increase reactivity, which may lead to oxidative stress and tissue damage.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a chlorine atom or a bromine atom, then it may have adverse effects on the ear and labyrinth. This rule applies to compounds in rows 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 10.
Rule 2: If a compound has a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may have adverse effects on the ear and labyrinth. This rule applies to compounds in row 5.
Rule 3: If a compound has a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), then it may not have adverse effects on the ear and labyrinth. This rule applies to compounds in row 9.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as carbonyl or carboxyl groups, it may lead to adverse effects in the ear and labyrinth system. The presence of these groups increases the polarity of the molecule, which allows it to cross the blood-labyrinth barrier more easily. This can result in damage to the inner ear structures, leading to hearing loss, vertigo, and other symptoms.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a conjugated double bond system may also have potential adverse effects on the ear and labyrinth system. Conjugated systems increase the molecule's ability to absorb light energy, making it more reactive and potentially toxic. Additionally, some studies suggest that certain types of conjugated molecules may interfere with the normal functioning of the auditory nerve, causing hearing loss.
Rule 3: Molecules containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine may also be associated with adverse effects on the ear and labyrinth system. These atoms can increase the molecule's reactivity and hydrophobicity, allowing it to penetrate cell membranes more easily. However, further research is needed to determine the exact mechanisms by which halogens contribute to toxicity in this context.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders:

Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a guanidine group (-CN3), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" in the dataset.
