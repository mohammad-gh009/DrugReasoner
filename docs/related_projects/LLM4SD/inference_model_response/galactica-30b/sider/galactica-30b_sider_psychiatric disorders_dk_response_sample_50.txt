Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to psychiatric disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 6 and 7 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecule number 8 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom (-F) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecule numbers 9 and 10 in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (-C=O) and halogen atoms like chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br) in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on mental health.
Explanation: Carbonyl group is known to interact with biological molecules and alter their function. Halogen atoms are also known to affect protein-ligand interactions by altering the electronic structure of the ligand. These changes can lead to altered signaling pathways and potentially cause adverse effects on mental health.
Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic rings such as benzene (C6H6) or pyridine (C5H5N) have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on mental health compared to non-aromatic compounds.
Explanation: Aromatic rings are planar and have a delocalized electron system which makes them more reactive than non-aromatic compounds. This increased reactivity can lead to stronger interactions with biological molecules and potentially cause adverse effects on mental health.
Rule 3: Compounds containing nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as pyrazole (C3H4N2) or imidazole (C3H4N2) may be associated with adverse effects on mental health due to their ability to bind to neurotransmitters or other receptors involved in mood regulation.
Explanation: Nitrogen-containing heterocycles are commonly found in drugs used to treat mental health conditions such as depression or anxiety. They can act as agonists or antagonists at neurotransmitter receptors and modulate their activity. Therefore, the presence of these heterocycles in a compound increases its potential for causing adverse effects on mental health.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a nitro group (-NO2) present in the structure of the molecule, then it may have potential side effects on psychiatric disorders. The presence of this functional group may increase the reactivity and toxicity of the compound. Therefore, molecules containing such groups should be avoided or used with caution for therapeutic purposes.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a phosphorus atom bonded to three carbon atoms, as in the case of the third SMILES string provided, then it may also exhibit potential side effects on psychiatric disorders due to its high reactivity. This type of molecular structure may interact with other biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions.
Rule 3: If the molecule has a negatively charged ion, such as a carboxylate anion (-COO-) or a sulfonate anion (-SO3-), attached to a benzene ring, as in the cases of the thirteenth and sixteenth SMILES strings respectively, then it may potentially bind to receptors in the brain and affect mood regulation. Such compounds should be carefully evaluated before being considered for use in therapy.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a cyano group (-CN) and a sulfur atom (S) in its ring system, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. The given SMILES string CC(CN1C2=CC=CC=C2SC3=CC=CC=C31)N(C)C 1 satisfies this rule.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a phosphate group (-OPO(OH)2) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected by a carbon atom, then it does not have any significant association with adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. The given SMILES string C(CC(O)(P(=O)(O)O)P(=O)(O)O)CN 0 satisfies this rule.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to a cyclic compound, then it may be associated with adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. The given SMILES strings CCC[C@@H](C(=O)OCC)N[C@H](C)C(=O)N1[C@H]2CCCC[C@H]2C[C@H]1C(=O)O.CC(C)(C)N 1 and C1=CC(=CC=C1SC(P(=O)(O)[O-])P(=O)(O)[O-])Cl.[Na+].[Na+] 0 satisfy this rule.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a five-membered ring with one or more heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, etc., then it may have potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings starting with C1CCC(CC1)C(CC2CCCCN2)C3CCCCC3, CCC12CCC3C(C1CCC2(C#C)O)CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34, F, CC1C(O1)P(=O)(O)O, CN+(C)(C)CCO, NC2=CC(=C(C=C2S(=O)(=O)N1)S(=O)(=O)N)Cl, COC(=O)C1(CCC2C1(CC(C3=C4CCC(=O)C=C4CCC23)C5=CC=C(C=C5)N(C)C)C)O, CNC1C2CC(CC1C3C2O3)OC(=O)C(CO)C4=CC=CC=C4, FCC1(FC(F)(F)CFc2ccc(cc2Oc3ccccc3Br)n2nc3ccccc23)C(F)(F)F, CCS(=O)(=O)C1(C)C(=C)C(

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonate group (-SO3-) and two sodium ions (Na+), then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. The presence of these groups suggests that the molecule may interact with neurotransmitters or other molecules in the brain, leading to adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a sulfonamide group (-NHSO2R), then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. Nitro compounds are known to affect the central nervous system, so their presence in this type of molecule could indicate potential side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains iodine atoms (I) and a carbonyl group (C=O), then it may not have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule is based on the fact that many drugs containing iodine atoms and carbonyl groups are used to treat various medical conditions without causing significant side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to psychiatric disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C[N+](C)(C)CC(=O)[O-] and CC(=O)NCC1CN(C(=O)O1)C2=CC(=C(C=C2)N3CCOCC3)F.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a quinolone ring system, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CCC12CCC3C(C1CCC2O)CCC4=C3C=CC(=C4)O and CNC1=C(C=C(C=C1)C2=NC3=C(S2)C=C(C=C3)O)F.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a coumarin ring system, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CC(=O)[C@]1(CC[C@@H]2[C@@]1(CC[C@H]3[C@H]2CCC4

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular formula contains sulfur and nitrogen atoms, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in psychiatric disorders. The presence of these elements may indicate the potential for interaction with neurotransmitters or other biological molecules involved in mental health.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains chlorine atoms, then it also has a high probability of causing adverse effects in psychiatric disorders. Chlorine is often used as a substituent in drug design due to its ability to increase lipophilicity and improve membrane permeability. However, excessive exposure to chlorinated compounds can lead to neurological damage and cognitive impairment.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains conjugated double bonds, then it has a moderate probability of causing adverse effects in psychiatric disorders. Conjugated double bonds can facilitate electron transfer reactions within the body, which may affect neurotransmitter function or other physiological processes relevant to mental health.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as nitro groups and sulfonyl groups in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on psychiatric disorders.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a heterocyclic ring system or multiple aromatic rings may also have a higher likelihood of exhibiting adverse effects on psychiatric disorders.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and lipophilicity of a compound may also play a role in determining its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and affect central nervous system function. Molecules with lower molecular weights and greater hydrophilicity may be less likely to penetrate the brain and cause adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on psychiatric disorders.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to interact with biological systems and disrupt normal functioning, which could lead to negative consequences. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their potential risks before being used in therapy.
Rule 2: A compound with a heterocyclic ring structure may also increase the risk of causing adverse effects on psychiatric disorders.
Explanation: Heterocyclic rings are often associated with increased reactivity and toxicity due to their unique chemical properties. Therefore, compounds containing this type of structural feature should be treated with caution when considering their use in therapy.
Rule 3: Compounds with a high degree of lipophilicity may have a higher likelihood of crossing the blood-brain barrier and affecting central nervous system function.
Explanation: This property allows molecules to easily penetrate cell membranes and access intracellular targets, including those within the brain. Therefore, compounds with high lipophilicities should be closely monitored for any potential neurological side effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a benzene ring in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 and 7.
Rule 2: A compound containing a nitro group (-NO2) has a higher chance of exhibiting adverse effects than one without it. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 8 and 9.
Rule 3: Compounds with a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) have a lower risk of causing adverse effects compared to those without it. This rule can be used for molecules labeled as 10 and 11.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict whether a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to psychiatric disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring and a carbonyl group, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains both a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms and also contains a double bond between two carbon atoms, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. The second molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a pyridine ring and a double bond between two carbon atoms.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a fluorine atom, then it does not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. The third molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a fluorine atom.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a benzene ring, it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in psychiatric disorders. The first two compounds in the dataset contain both these features and have been labeled as having side-effect activity.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) and a pyrimidine ring, it may also have a high probability of causing adverse effects in psychiatric disorders. The third compound in the dataset contains both these features but has not been labeled as having side-effect activity yet.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to an alkene chain, it may be less likely to cause adverse effects in psychiatric disorders. The last three compounds in the dataset do not contain any of the previously mentioned features and have been labeled as not having side-effect activity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to psychiatric disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a benzene ring (-C6H5), then it may have side-effects related to psychiatric disorders. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O), a five-membered ring containing one nitrogen atom (-C4H4N), and fluorine atoms (-F), then it may have side-effects related to psychiatric disorders. The second molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), a nitro group (-NO2), and a negatively charged oxygen atom (-O-), then it may not have side-effects related to psychiatric disorders. The third molecule in the dataset does not satisfy this rule because it only contains a sulfonyl group but no nitro or negatively charged oxygen groups.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a sulfonamide group in the SMILES string "CC1=C(SO2NH)C3=CC=CC=C3C2=OS1" suggests that this molecule could be associated with psychiatric disorders due to its similarity to other drugs known to have such associations.
Rule 2: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure may also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects. For instance, the SMILES string "CC1=CNN2C(=O)Nc3ccccc3n(C)c2C1" contains a long chain of atoms and multiple rings, which may make it more likely to interact with biological systems and cause harm.
Rule 3: The charge and polarity of a molecule can affect its interactions with other molecules and its ability to cross cell membranes. For example, the SMILES strings "CC(C)NCC(COC1=CC=C(C=C1)CCOC)O" and "CCCCCC(C=CC1C(CC(=O)C1CCCCCCC(=O)O)O)O" both contain polar functional groups but differ in their overall charges, which may impact their behavior within cells.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in the para position relative to a carbonyl group, then it may have potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1=CC2=C(C=C1C(=O)O)OC(=N2)C3=CC(=CC(=C3)Cl)Cl and CC(C(CN1C=NC=N1)(C2=C(C=C(C=C2)F)F)O)N3CCC(=C)CC3.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a benzimidazole ring connected through a nitrogen atom to another aromatic ring, then it may have potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CN(C)CCCN1C2=CC=CC=C2CCC3=CC=CC=C31 and C1CN(CCN1CCOCC(=O)O)C(C2=CC=CC=C2)C3=CC=C(C=C3)Cl.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group attached to a cyclohexane ring, then it may have potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C(C(C(C(C(CO)O)O)O)O)

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds and triple bonds, then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains two conjugated systems of double bonds and one triple bond.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl), then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. The second molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a nitro group attached to a carbon atom.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a heterocyclic ring structure such as a pyrimidine ring or a pyridine ring, then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. The third molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a pyrimidine ring.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to psychiatric disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to the second SMILES string provided in the dataset where the presence of the cyano group is indicated by the symbol "#N".
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to a cyclopentane ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to the third SMILES string provided in the dataset where the presence of the carbonyl group is indicated by the symbol "=O".
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) bonded to two carbon atoms, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to the sixth SMILES string provided in the dataset where the presence of the sulfonyl group is indicated by the symbols "OS(=O)(=O)".

================================

Rule 1: The presence of chlorine atom in the structure may indicate potential for causing adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings C1C(=C(N2C(S1)C(C2=O)NC(=O)C(C3=CC=CC=C3)N)C(=O)O)Cl and CCC1C(C(C(C(=O)C(CC(C(C(C(C(C(=O)O1)C)OC2CC(C(C(O2)C)O)(C)OC)C)OC3C(C(CC(O3)C)N(C)C)OC(=O)CCC(=O)OCC)(C)O)C)C)O)(C)O.
Rule 2: The absence of bromine or iodine atoms in the structure may indicate low likelihood of causing adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings CC1=CC(=C(C(=C1NC(=O)CN(CC(=O)O)CC(=O)O)C)Br)C and COCCCN1CCC(CC1)NC(=O)C2=CC(=C(C3=C2OCC3)N)Cl.
Rule 3: The presence of conjugated double bonds in the structure may increase the probability of causing adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=C(N3C=C(C=CC3=N2)C)CC(=O)N(C)C and CN1CCN(CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-].

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (-C=O) and cyano group (-CN) in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on mental health.
Explanation: Carbonyl and cyano groups are known to have toxic effects on living organisms due to their ability to bind to proteins and enzymes, leading to disruption of cellular processes. These groups may also affect the permeability of cell membranes, making them more susceptible to damage by other chemicals or toxins. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their potential to cause adverse effects on mental health.
Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic rings, especially those with electron-withdrawing substituents like chlorine atoms, may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects on mental health.
Explanation: Aromatic rings are planar and hydrophobic, which makes them ideal for interacting with biological membranes and receptors. However, the presence of electronegative substituents like chlorine atoms can make the ring more reactive and potentially toxic. For example, the compound C1 contains two chlorophenyl groups, which may contribute to its potential to cause adverse effects on mental health.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule may also play a role in determining its potential to cause adverse effects on mental health. Longer chains and more complex structures may require more energy and resources to break down and eliminate from the body, increasing the likelihood of accumulation and toxicity. Therefore, molecules with longer chains and more complex structures should be evaluated cautiously for their potential to cause adverse effects on mental health.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three possible rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in the form of a single bond, then it is likely to have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "CCOC1=CC=C(C=C1)CC2=C(C=CC(=C2)[C@H]3[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O3)CO)O)O)O)Cl 0" or similar structures containing a chlorinated carbon atom.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom in the form of a double bond, followed by a carbonyl group (represented as "C=O"), then it is unlikely to have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "CCC[C@@H](C(=O)OCC)N[C@H](C)C(=O)N1[C@H]2CCCC[C@H]2C[C@H]1C(=O)O CCC(C)C1C(=O)NC(C(=O)NC(C(=O)NC(CSSCC(C(=O)NC(C(=O)N1)CC2=CC=C(C=C2

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three possible rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders based on its structure or properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. The first molecule in the dataset contains such a group and has a label of 1, indicating that it does have these side effects. However, this rule alone would not be sufficient to make a definitive prediction since there are many other molecules in the dataset without sulfonyl groups but still having label 1.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. The second molecule in the dataset contains such a group and has a label of 1, supporting this hypothesis. Again, this rule alone cannot provide a definite answer either.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl), then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains one Cl atom and has a label of 1, providing some support for this rule. This rule is more specific than the previous two and could potentially be useful for predicting which molecules are more likely to have these side effects.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a benzene ring, it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in psychiatric disorders. The first three molecules listed have this structure and they all have label 1 indicating their potential for causing such effects.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a cyano group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (-C=O), it may also be associated with adverse effects in psychiatric disorders. This structure appears in the second molecule listed and it too has label 1.
Rule 3: If a compound contains two chlorine atoms on adjacent carbon atoms in a phenyl ring, it may reduce its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore decrease its likelihood of causing adverse effects in psychiatric disorders. The fourth molecule listed has this structure and it has label 0, indicating no known association with these types of effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules 7, 8, and 9 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules 10 and 11 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules 12 and 13 in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of negatively charged atoms such as oxygen and nitrogen in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on mental health. This rule can be applied by analyzing the chemical structure of the compounds and identifying any negatively charged atoms present. For example, in the first SMILES string, there is a sodium ion attached to one end of the molecule which may increase its potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: The presence of aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds in a compound also increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on mental health. These structures can affect the electronic configuration of the compound and potentially interact with biological systems in ways that could lead to negative outcomes. For instance, in the second SMILES string, there is a conjugated system of double bonds present which may contribute to the compound's ability to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: The absence of hydrogen bonding groups such as alcohols, amines, and carboxylic acids decreases the likelihood of a compound causing adverse effects on mental health. Hydrogen bonding can affect the solubility and stability of a compound, which can impact its interactions with biological systems. For example, in the fifth SMILES string, there is no alcohol group present which may decrease the compound's potential to cause adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to psychiatric disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a bromine atom, it is more likely to have side-effects associated with psychiatric disorders than molecules without bromine atoms. This rule is supported by the fact that many drugs used for treating psychiatric disorders contain bromine atoms as part of their chemical structure. For example, the drug called Flupentixol contains a bromine atom and is commonly prescribed for treating depression and anxiety.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), it is less likely to have side-effects associated with psychiatric disorders compared to molecules without this functional group. Cyano groups are often found in pesticides and other chemicals that are not typically used in medicine or pharmacology. However, some studies suggest that certain compounds containing cyano groups may have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that could potentially be useful in treating neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it is more likely to have side-effects associated with psychiatric disorders compared to molecules without this functional group. Sulfonyl groups are commonly found in antidiabetic drugs like Glipizide and Glyburide, which are known to cause mood swings and other psychiatric symptoms in some patients. It is possible that these side-effects are caused by interactions between the sulfonyl group and neurotransmitter receptors in the brain.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a phosphorus atom bonded to two oxygen atoms in a phosphate group, then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. The presence of this functional group suggests that the molecule may interact with biological systems in ways that could lead to these types of adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom in a five-membered ring, then it may also have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This functional group is often found in pharmaceuticals and can affect their chemical and physical properties as well as their interactions with biological systems.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may also have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. These functional groups are known to be toxic and can interfere with normal cellular processes, which could lead to negative health outcomes.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to psychiatric disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. The first example in the dataset meets this criterion and has been labeled as having the potential for such effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains iron atoms bonded together in a double bond or triple bond configuration, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. The third example in the dataset meets this criterion and has been labeled as not having the potential for such effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. The sixth example in the dataset meets this criterion and has been labeled as not having the potential for such effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule by having both groups present.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a conjugated system of double bonds, then it may also have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. The second molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule by having both groups present.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) and a benzene ring, then it may also have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. The third molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule by having both groups present.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to psychiatric disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a sulfonamide group (-SO2NR2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. The first example in the dataset satisfies this rule by having both groups present.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a benzene ring, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. The second example in the dataset satisfies this rule by having both groups present.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom (-F) attached to a carbon atom, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. This is because fluorinated compounds often have improved pharmacokinetic properties compared to their non-fluorinated counterparts. The last example in the dataset does not satisfy this rule since there is no fluorine atom present.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of chlorine atoms in the molecular structure may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects associated with psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules such as CCC(=C)C(=O)C1=C(C(=C(C=C1)OCC(=O)O)Cl)Cl and CC1C2CC3=C(C1(CCN2CC=C(C)C)C)C=C(C=C3)O.
Rule 2: The presence of conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings in the molecular structure may also increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects associated with psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules such as CCO/N=C(/C1=NSC(=N1)NP(=O)(O)[O-])\C(=O)NC2C3N(C2=O)C(=C(CS3)SC4=NC(=CS4)C5=CC=[N+](C=C5)C)C(=O)O and CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4([C@]3(C(CC2([C@]1(C(=O)CCl)O)C)O)F)C.
Rule 3: The absence of specific functional groups such as carbonyl groups or amino groups in the molecular structure may decrease the likelihood of causing adverse effects associated with psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules such as CN(C)CC(C1=CC=C(C=C1)O)C2(CCCCC2)O and CC1=C(C(C(=C(N1)C)C(=O)OC(C)C)C2=CC(=CC=C2)[N+](=O)[O-])C(=O)OCCOC.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure "C1=C(C=C(C(=C1NC(=O)C(=O)O)Cl) NC(=O)C(=O)O) C#N" or "CC[C@@H]1[C@@]2([C@@H]([C@@H](C(=O)[C@@H](C[C@@]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)[C@H](C(=O)O1)C)C)O[C@H]3[C@@H]([C@H](C[C@H](O3)C)N(C)C)O)(C)OC)C)C)N(C(=O)O2)CCCCN4C=C(N=C4)C5=CN=CC=C5" then it is likely to have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule is based on the fact that these substructures contain functional groups such as isocyanates and amides which are known to have biological activities in the central nervous system.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure "CC1=CN(C(=O)NC1=O)C2CC(C(O2)CO)N=[N+]=[N-] 1" or "[Sm] 0" then it is unlikely to

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to psychiatric disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) separated by two carbon atoms, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. The first example in the dataset satisfies this rule.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) attached to a benzene ring, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. The second example in the dataset violates this rule.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. The third example in the dataset violates this rule.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided in the dataset and should be used cautiously until further research is conducted.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders. The presence of this functional group in certain drugs such as divalproex sodium and topiramate has been linked to mood changes and other psychiatric symptoms. Therefore, molecules containing this group should be carefully evaluated for their potential risks.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders. Nitro compounds are known to cause a range of neurological and psychological symptoms including headaches, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, depression, anxiety, and even psychosis. Therefore, molecules containing this group should also be closely monitored for any potential negative effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may also have potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders. Fluorine is a highly electronegative element that can significantly alter the chemical and physical properties of a molecule. Some fluorinated drugs such as fluoxetine and sertraline have been associated with a range of psychiatric side effects including suicidal ideation, depression, and mania. Therefore, molecules containing fluorine atoms should be carefully evaluated for their potential risks.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a cyano group (-CN) and a pyrimidine ring (-C4N2), then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in relation to psychiatric disorders. The given SMILES string C1CCC(C1)C(CC#N)N2C=C(C=N2)C3=C4C=CNC4=NC=N3 satisfies this rule.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a conjugated system between two double bonds separated by one single bond, then it may have a potential for causing adverse effects due to its ability to interact with biological systems. The given SMILES strings CN1C(CNC2=C1C(=O)N=C(N2)N)CNC3=CC=C(C=C3)C(=O)NC(CCC(=O)O)C(=O)O and CC[C@@]1(C[C@H]2C[C@@](C3=C(CCN(C2)C1)C4=CC=CC=C4N3)(C5=C(C=C6C(=C5)[C@]78CCN9[C@H]7[C@@](C=CC9)([C@H]([C@@]([C@@H]8N6C)(C(=O)OC)O)OC(=O)C)CC)OC

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1=CC(=CC=C1C(C(CO)NC(=O)C(Cl)Cl)O)[N+](=O)[O-] and CC(C)(C(C(=O)O)N)S.
Rule 2: A calcium ion (Ca+2) in a molecule may also contribute to its ability to cause adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES string [Ca+2].
Rule 3: The absence of a cyano group (-CN) or a thiocarbonyl group (-CS-) in a molecule may decrease its potential for causing adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CN1CCN2C(C1)C3=CC=CC=C3CC4=C2N=CC=C4 and CCCC(=O)NC1=CC(=C(C=C1)OCC(CNC(C)C)O)C(=O)C.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure "CCN(CC)CCNC(=O)C1=C(NC(=C1C)C=C2C3=C(C=CC(=C3)F)NC2=O)C" and also contains the element zinc, then it is likely to have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule is based on the fact that some drugs containing this substructure have been shown to have anti-psychotic effects in clinical trials. The presence of zinc may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of these molecules but may also increase their toxicity. Therefore, caution should be taken when using such compounds.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure "C(CC(C(=O)O)N)CN=C(N)N" or "CC1=C(N2C(C(C2=O)NC(=O)C(C3=CC=C(C=C3)O)N)SC1)C(=O)O", then it is unlikely to have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. These substructures are commonly found in many natural products and pharmaceuticals that do not have any known psychiatric side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains the substructure "CCOC1=CC=CC=C1OCCN[C@@H](C)CC2=CC(=C(C=C2)OC)S(=O)(=O)N.Cl" or "CNC[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](CO)O)O)O)O.CNC[C@@H

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-COOH" in a compound may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects on mental health. This rule can be applied to molecules such as C[N+]1(C2CC(CC1C3C2O3)OC(=O)C(CO)C4=CC=CC=C4)C and CC(C(=O)N1C2CCCCC2CC1C(=O)O)NC(CCC3=CC=CC=C3)C(=O)O.
Rule 2: A compound containing the functional group "-NO2" may also have the potential to cause adverse effects on mental health. This rule can be applied to molecules such as COC1=NC(=NC2=C1N=CN2[C@H]3[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O3)CO)O)O)N and CCC(C)(CC1=CC=CC=C1)N.
Rule 3: Compounds containing aromatic rings or heterocyclic structures may also pose a risk of causing adverse effects on mental health. This rule can be applied to molecules such as C1NN=C(N1)c1ccc(cc1)Br and O=P(Nc1ccccc1Oc1ccccc1)(OP(=O)(O)c1ccccc1)n1ccccc1.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a barium ion (Ba+2) or calcium ion (Ca+2), then it may have potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule is based on the fact that these ions play important roles in various biological processes within the body, including those related to mental health. However, this rule should be taken with caution as there may be other factors that contribute to the development of such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl) bonded to a carbon atom, then it may not have potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule is based on the observation that many drugs containing Cl atoms do not have any known side effects related to psychiatric disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom (F) attached to a benzene ring, then it may have potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule is based on the fact that fluorinated compounds have been shown to exhibit different chemical and physical properties compared to their non-fluorinated counterparts, which can lead to altered biological activities. While further research would be needed to confirm this association, this rule provides a starting point for investigating the relationship between molecular structures and potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of chlorine in a compound increases its chances of causing adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. This rule can be inferred from the fact that two out of three compounds containing chlorine have been labeled as having side-effects related to psychiatric disorders.
Rule 2: Compounds containing nitrogen and sulfur atoms may increase the risk of causing adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. This rule can be inferred from the fact that one of the compounds containing both nitrogen and sulfur has been labeled as having such side-effects.
Rule 3: Compounds containing aromatic rings may also increase the risk of causing adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. This rule can be inferred from the fact that four out of six compounds containing aromatic rings have been labeled as having side-effects related to psychiatric disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a bromine atom, it is more likely to have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "CC(=O)O[C@H]1C[C@@H]2CC[C@@H]3[C@@H]([C@]2(C[C@@H]1N4CCCCC4)C)CC[C@]5([C@H]3C[C@@H]([C@@H]5OC(=O)C)[N+]6(CCCCC6)C)C.[Br-]" or "C1CN=C(N1)NC2=C(C=CC=C2Cl)Cl". These two examples both contain a bromine atom which may contribute to their side effect activity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in the para position relative to a carbonyl group, it is less likely to have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "CCCCCCCCC1=CC=C(C=C1)CCC(CO)(CO)N.Cl". The presence of this specific functional group may reduce the likelihood of side effects due to its electron withdrawing nature.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group attached to a benzene ring, it is also less

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a chlorine atom and a benzene ring, then it may have potential side effects in relation to psychiatric disorders. The presence of these two features together suggests that the compound could interact with neurotransmitters or other molecules involved in mental health conditions such as depression or anxiety. However, this rule should be used cautiously since there may be many other factors that contribute to the overall toxicity of a molecule.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond system, then it may also have potential side effects in relation to psychiatric disorders. This type of structure is often associated with reactivity and may affect the ability of the molecule to cross the blood-brain barrier or interact with target receptors. Again, this rule should be used cautiously because there may be many other factors at play.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a nitrogen-containing heterocycle and a sulfonyl group, then it may have potential side effects in relation to psychiatric disorders. Nitrogen-containing heterocycles are commonly found in drugs targeting central nervous system disorders, while sulfonyl groups are known to increase the permeability of compounds across cell membranes. Together, these features suggest that the compound has the potential to interact with targets within the brain and produce adverse effects. However, again, this rule should be used cautiously due to the complexity of biological systems and the many factors that can influence drug efficacy and safety.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three possible rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) or a carbonyl group (-COR) in its structure, then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as "1" for having such side effects. For example, the first molecule in the list contains both groups and is labeled as "1".
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) in its structure, then it may not have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as "0" for not having such side effects. For example, the last molecule in the list contains a nitro group but is labeled as "0".
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a metal ion like magnesium (Mg+2) or iron (Fe) in its structure, then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule also applies to molecules labeled as "1" for having such side effects. However, this rule should be taken with caution since there might be other factors involved besides the presence of these ions.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular formula contains iron or zinc ions, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in psychiatric disorders. This rule is based on the fact that these metal ions play important roles in various biological processes and their presence in excess can lead to oxidative stress and cellular damage.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have a higher chance of causing adverse effects due to its electronegative nature. Chlorine atoms can alter the electronic structure of the molecule and affect its reactivity and binding affinity towards target proteins.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may be more likely to cause adverse effects as this functional group can interact with enzymes and receptors involved in neurological functions. However, this rule should be used cautiously as some molecules containing nitro groups have been approved for clinical use without any reported adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in the first molecule suggests that it could have some potential for causing adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. Similarly, the presence of a zinc atom in the second molecule indicates that it might be toxic and potentially harmful if ingested or inhaled.
Rule 2: The structure of a molecule plays a crucial role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects. For instance, the third molecule contains a cyclopropane ring, which is known to be highly reactive and may contribute to its toxicity. Additionally, the fourth molecule has a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a benzene ring, which is often associated with mutagenicity and carcinogenicity.
Rule 3: The number and position of substituents on a molecule can also affect its potential to cause adverse effects. For example, the fifth molecule has two carbonyl groups (-C=O) connected by a double bond, which makes it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack and may lead to further reactions that could result in adverse effects. Moreover, the sixth molecule has a sulfur-containing substituent, which is often associated with neurotoxicity due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to psychiatric disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a phosphate group (represented by the formula P(=O)(OH)3 or its equivalent) and at least one oxygen atom bonded to phosphorus through two single bonds, then it may have side-effect activity related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C(=O)([O-])P(=O)([O-])[O-] and CC1=C(C=CC=C1O)C(=O)NC(CSC2=CC=CC=C2)C(CN3CC4CCCCC4CC3C(=O)NC(C)(C)C)O.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (represented by the formula NO2), then it may not have side-effect activity related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES string N.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains platinum ions (represented by the symbol Pt), then it may have side-effect activity related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES string [NH2-].[NH2-].Cl[Pt+2]Cl.
Note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the given dataset and should be treated as preliminary until further validated by experimental studies.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular formula contains chlorine and has at least one aromatic ring, then it is likely to have adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. The given SMILES string C1=CC(=C(C(=C1)Cl)C=NN=C(N)N)Cl satisfies this rule as it contains both chlorine and an aromatic ring.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or its derivatives such as sulfonylurea (-CONHC(=O)SO2NR2R3 where R2 and R3 are alkyl groups), then it may be associated with adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. The given SMILES strings CC(C(=O)N1C2CCCCC2CC1C(=O)O)NC(CCC3=CC=CC=C3)C(=O)O and OP(=O)([O-])[O-].[K+].[K+] satisfy this rule since they contain sulfonamide and sulfonylurea functional groups respectively.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains amide group (-CONHR- where R is any organic group) followed by a carbonyl group (-C=O) in the same chain, then it may be associated with adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. The given SMILES string C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)SCC(=O)NCC(=O)NCC(=O)NCC(=O)O satisfies this rule as it contains two consecutive amide groups separated by a carbonyl

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a cyano group (-CN) and a benzene ring (-C6H5), then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in relation to psychiatric disorders. The given SMILES string CN(C)CCC1=CNC2=C1C=C(C=C2)CN3C=NC=N3 matches this rule.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) attached to a phenyl ring (-C6H5), then it may have some potential for causing adverse effects due to its ability to bind to biological receptors. The given SMILES string C1COCC2=C1N=CC3=N/C(=C\4/C=CON4)/N=C23 matches this rule.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a sodium ion (Na+) bonded to a carboxylate group (-COO-), then it may be able to cross the blood-brain barrier and potentially cause adverse effects on the central nervous system. The given SMILES string CC(C1=CC2=C(C=C1)C=C(C=C2)OC)C(=O)[O-].[Na+] matches this rule.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on mental health.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to interact with biological systems and disrupt normal cellular processes, leading to various types of toxicity including neurological damage. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their potential to cause adverse effects on mental health.
Rule 2: Compounds with a high degree of symmetry or planarity may also exhibit increased risk of adverse effects on mental health.
Explanation: Such structures may facilitate intermolecular interactions and promote aggregation, which could lead to toxic effects on cells and tissues. For example, compounds with symmetrical aromatic rings or polycyclic structures have been shown to induce neurotoxicity through this mechanism.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a compound's carbon chain may also affect its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and exert neurotoxic effects.
Explanation: Longer chains and more complex structures may require additional metabolic steps to break down and eliminate from the body, increasing the likelihood of accumulation and toxicity in sensitive organs like the brain. Additionally, certain structural features such as branching or cyclization may hinder transport across the blood-brain barrier, further reducing the compound's potential to reach target sites within the central nervous system.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to psychiatric disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure CN(C)C/C=C/C(=O)NC1=C(C=C2C(=C1)C(=NC=N2)NC3=CC(=C(C=C3)F)Cl)O[C@@H]4CCOC4, then it is likely to have side-effect activity related to psychiatric disorders. This rule is based on the fact that this particular substructure is present in one of the molecules labeled as having such activity and absent from all those without it. However, it's important to note that this rule should only be used as a starting point for further analysis and experimentation, and not as a definitive predictor of side-effect activity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure C[C@@]1(C2C[C@H]3[C@@H](C(=O)C(=C([C@]3(C(=O)C2=C(C4=C1C=CC=C4O)O)O)O)C(=O)NCNCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)N)N(C)C)O, then it is unlikely to have side-effect activity related to psychiatric
