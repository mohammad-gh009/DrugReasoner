Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a phosphorus atom bonded to two oxygen atoms and one carbon atom, then it may have side-effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The SMILES string for this structure is C[C@H]1[C@H](O1)P(=O)(O)[O-]. This rule applies only to the first molecule listed in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to three carbon atoms in a ring structure, then it may not have any side-effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The SMILES string for this structure is C(=NC(=N)N)(N)N. This rule applies only to the second molecule listed in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring connected to a cyclopentane ring through a carbonyl group, then it may have side-effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The SMILES string for this structure is CC(C)(C1=CC=CC=C1CCC(C2=CC=CC(=C2)C=CC3=NC4=C(C=CC(=C4)Cl)C=C3)SCC5(CC5)CC(=O)O)O. This rule applies only to the third molecule listed in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have side effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The given SMILES string has this functional group in its structure, so it should be labeled as 1 for having such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains two positively charged phosphorus atoms separated by one carbon atom, then it may not have any adverse effects. The second SMILES string does not have this structural feature, so it should be labeled as 0 for not having any side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a cyano group (-CN) adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O) on a five-membered ring, then it may have side effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders. The third SMILES string has this functional group in its structure, so it should be labeled as 1 for having such side effects.

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to ear and labyrinth disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to ear and labyrinth disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amides, and amines in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the ear and labyrinth. These functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions.
Rule 2: A compound containing multiple rings or aromatic systems may also have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on the ear and labyrinth due to their ability to penetrate cell membranes and bind to proteins.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a compound's structure may also play a role in determining its toxicity. Longer chains and more complex structures may make it harder for the body to break down and eliminate the compound, leading to accumulation and increased risk of adverse effects.

Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should be carefully evaluated for possible side effects on the auditory system.
Rule 3: Molecules containing aromatic rings such as benzene or pyridine may also pose a risk of damaging the auditory system. These structures can interact with proteins and enzymes in the body, leading to cellular damage and inflammation. As a result, compounds containing these moieties should be closely monitored for any signs of toxicity to the auditory system.
