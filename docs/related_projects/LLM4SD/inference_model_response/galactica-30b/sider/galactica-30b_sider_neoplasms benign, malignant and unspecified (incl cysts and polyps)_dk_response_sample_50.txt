Rule 1: If a molecule contains the substructure "CC(=O)N=C(N)N" or "CC(=O)ON=C(N)N", then it is likely to have side-effect activity related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C(CCl)NC(=O)N(CCCl)N=O and CC(C)[N+](C)(CCOC(=O)C1C2=CC=CC=C2OC3=CC=CC=C13)C(C)C.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains the substructure "C#N", then it is unlikely to have side-effect activity related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps).

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyls or amines in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects.
Explanation: These functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to toxicity. For example, the compound with SMILES string CC1C2CCC3(C(C2(CCC1O)C)C(CC4C3(CC(C4=C(CCC=C(C)C)C(=O)O)OC(=O)C)C)O)C has a ketone group which may contribute to its ability to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: A compound containing multiple rings or fused rings may have higher potential for causing adverse effects due to its increased stability and lipophilicity.
Explanation: Rings and fused rings can enhance the interaction between a compound and biological targets, increasing its potency. For instance, the compound with SMILES string CCC[C@]1(CC(=O)C(=C(O1)[O-])[C@H](CC)C2=CC(=CC=C2)[N-]S(=O)(=O)C3=NC=C(C=C3)C(F)(F)F)CCC4=CC=CC=C4.[Na+].[Na+] contains two naphthalene rings which may contribute to its toxic effects.

This rule applies only to the second SMILES string provided in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains the substructure "C(C1C(C(C(C(O1)O)F)O)O)O" or "C(CC(C(=O)O)N)CN=C(N)N" or "C1=CN(C(=O)N=C1N)C

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring or a heterocyclic aromatic system, then it may have potential carcinogenic effects. The presence of such structures in a compound increases its ability to bind to DNA and disrupt normal cellular processes leading to cancer. Therefore, compounds containing these structures should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential mutagenic and carcinogenic effects. Nitro groups can interact with DNA and lead to mutations, which can result in various types of cancers. Therefore, compounds containing nitro groups should be used with caution.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a sulfhydryl group (-SH), then it may have potential toxic effects on the body. Sulfhydryl groups can react with other molecules and form disulfides, which can damage cells and tissues. Therefore, compounds containing sulfhydryl groups should be used with caution.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) or a cyano group (CN) in a compound may increase its likelihood of being toxic. Therefore, analyzing the chemical structure of a molecule can provide valuable insights into its potential toxicity.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule can also play a role in determining its ability to interact with biological systems. Large molecules with complex structures may be more likely to exhibit adverse effects than smaller, simpler compounds. Therefore, considering the molecular weight and complexity of a substance can help predict its potential toxicity.
Rule 3: The stereochemical configuration of a molecule can affect its reactivity and biological activity. For instance, enantiomers (mirror-image isomers) often have different physical and biological properties due to their distinct three-dimensional arrangements. Therefore, examining the stereochemistry of a compound can provide additional information about its potential toxicity.

Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure "CC(C(=O)NC1=C(C(=C(C(=C1I)C(=O)NC(CO)CO)I)C(=O)NC(CO)CO)I)O" or "C(CC(=O)O)CO" then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). This rule was derived from the first two SMILES strings which contain these substructures and were labeled as having adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure "CC(=O)N1CCN(CC1)C2=CC=C(C=C2)OCC3COC(O3)(CN4C=CN=C4)C5=C(C=C(C=C5)Cl)Cl" then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). This rule was derived from the third SMILES string which does not contain any of the previously mentioned substructures but still has no reported adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains the substructure "CC1(C(N2C(S1)C(C2=O)NC(=O)C

================================

Rule 2: Compounds containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or bromine have been known to cause reproductive toxicity in animals. Therefore, compounds containing these elements should also be considered for their potential side effects on reproduction.
Rule 3: Certain types of chemical bonds such as double bonds between carbon atoms or triple bonds between carbon and nitrogen atoms may increase the likelihood of toxic side effects. Therefore, compounds containing these types of bonds should be carefully evaluated for any potential negative impacts they may have on human health.

================================

Rule 2: If there is a presence of CC1=CN(C(=O)NC1=O)C2C=CC(O2)CO or CCCCCCCCCCCNCC=C.C[N+](C)(C)CCCCCCNCC=C.C=CCN.C1C(O1)CCl.Cl.[Cl-] in the SMILES string, then it may not be associated with neoplasm activity.
Rule 3: If there is a presence of CC(CC1=CC=C(C=C1)O)(C(=O)O)N or CCS(=O)(=O)NC(CC1=CC=C(C=C1)OCCCCC2CCNCC2)C(=O)O or CC(CC1=CC=C(C=C1)O)(C(=O)O)N or COC(=O)C(ccc1ccccc1)ncc2

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular formula contains sodium ions or has a negative charge on one end, then it may have side effects associated with neoplasm benign, malignant, and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps).
Explanation: Sodium ions and negatively charged molecules can interact with cells in the body, which could potentially lead to changes in cell behavior and growth. This could be a contributing factor to the development of neoplasms.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a phosphorus atom bonded to two nitrogen atoms, as well as three carbon atoms, then it may have side effects associated with neoplasm benign, malignant, and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps).
Explanation: The structure of this molecule resembles that of adenine, which is a component of DNA. Adenine plays a crucial role in cell division and growth, so any disruption to its function could potentially lead to the development of neoplasms.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group through a double bond, followed by another benzene ring, then it may not have side effects associated with neoplasm benign, malignant, and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps).
Explanation: This type of structure is commonly found in drugs used to treat cancer, such as doxorubicin. Doxorubicin works by intercalating into DNA and inhibiting topoisomerase II, which is essential for cell replication. Therefore, this type of structure may indicate that the molecule has anti-neoplastic properties.

Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). This rule applies to molecules 3, 4, 5, and 21.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of fluorine atoms in a compound increases its potential for causing adverse effects on health. This rule applies to molecules labeled as "1" in the given dataset. Fluorine is a highly electronegative element that can alter the electronic structure and reactivity of a molecule, leading to changes in its biological activity. For example, the molecule C1[C@@H]2[C@@H](C2N)CN1C3=C(C=C4C(=O)C(=CN(C4=N3)C5=C(C=C(C=C5)F)F)C(=O)O)F contains two fluorine atoms and has been shown to have anti-cancer activity against various types of cancer cells. On the other hand, compounds without any fluorine atoms or with only one fluorine atom may be less likely to exhibit such activities.
Rule 2: A compound containing a sulfhydryl group (-SH) attached to an aromatic ring is more likely to cause adverse effects than those without this functional group. This rule applies to molecules labeled as "1" in the given dataset. Sulfhydryl groups can interact with other molecules through covalent bonds, which can lead to the formation of disulfide bridges or other types of chemical reactions. These interactions can affect the function of proteins and enzymes, potentially leading to toxic effects. For instance, the molecule CC[C@H](C)[C@H]1C(=O)NC(C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@@H](CSSCCC(=O)N[C@@H](C(=O)N1)CC2=CC=C(C=C

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) or a sulfhydryl group (SH) in a compound may increase its reactivity and make it more likely to interact with biological molecules and cause harm. Therefore, identifying these functional groups in a molecule could be a first step towards predicting its toxicity.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule can also affect its ability to interact with other molecules and cause adverse effects. For instance, large and complex molecules may have a higher likelihood of interacting with multiple targets within cells, leading to more severe consequences. Therefore, analyzing the structure of a molecule using computational methods such as molecular modeling can provide valuable insights into its potential toxicity.
Rule 3: The chemical composition of a molecule can also play a role in determining its toxicity. For example, some elements such as metals or halogens may increase the reactivity of a molecule and enhance its ability to cause damage. Additionally, the presence of certain atoms or bonds may create sites of vulnerability where the molecule can react with biological molecules. Therefore, understanding the elemental composition and bonding patterns of a molecule can help identify its potential risks.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a bromine atom, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). The presence of a bromine atom in a molecule often indicates that it has a high degree of reactivity, which could potentially lead to harmful interactions with other molecules or biological systems. However, this rule should be applied cautiously as there may be other factors that contribute to the toxicity of a molecule beyond the presence of a specific functional group or structural feature.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom through two single bonds instead of one double bond, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). This type of nitrogen atom is known as a primary amine, and it is often associated with increased reactivity and toxicity compared to other types of amines.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (a carbon-oxygen double bond) conjugated with another double bond, such as in the case of an enone or a dienone, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). Conjugated carbonyl groups can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions with other molecules, leading to the formation of toxic adducts or metabolites

Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure "CCN1CCC=C2C3=CC=CC=C3SC4=C2C=C(C=C4)Cl" or "CC12CCN(C1N(C3=C2C=C(C=C3)OC(=O)NC)C)C" then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). These substructures contain the nitrogenous base cytosine which is known to have anti-neoplastic properties. However, further analysis would be required to confirm this hypothesis.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure "C[C@]12CC[C@H]3[C@H]([C@@H]1CC[C@@H]2O)[C@@H](CC4=C3C=CC(=C4)O)CCCCCCCCCS(=O)CCCC(C(F)(F)F)(F)F" then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). This substructure contains the fluorinated organic compound hexafluoropropene which is commonly used as a refrigerant and solvent but has also been shown to have anti-cancer properties. Further analysis would be required to determine its specific mechanism of action.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains the substructure "CC1=CC(=C(C=C1)SC2=CC=CC=C2N3CCNCC3)C" or "CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCOS(=O)(=O)O" or "CCC(=O)OC(C(C)C)OP(=O)(CCCCC1=CC=CC=C1)CC(=O)N

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of nitro groups (-NO2) or sulfonamide groups (-SO2NH2) in a compound may increase its toxicity. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule can also affect its ability to interact with biological targets and potentially cause adverse effects. Molecules with large, complex structures may have difficulty penetrating cell membranes and accessing target sites within cells. On the other hand, smaller molecules may be more likely to cross cellular barriers and exert toxic effects. Therefore, molecular weight and lipophilicity should be considered when evaluating the potential toxicity of a compound.
Rule 3: The chemical reactivity of a molecule can also play a role in determining its potential for causing adverse effects. Highly reactive compounds may undergo rapid metabolism or degradation in vivo, reducing their bioavailability and limiting their potential for causing harm. However, some highly reactive compounds may also exhibit potent biological activities and cause significant toxicity at low doses. Therefore, the stability and reactivity of a compound should be taken into account when assessing its potential risks.

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps):
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure "Cc1ccc(cc1)Oc1ccccc1" or "Cc1nc(C)n(C)c1Nc1nncn1", then it is likely to have adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). This rule is based on the fact that both molecules contain a cycloalkane ring which is known to have carcinogenic properties.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure "Cc1ccc(oc1)no", then it is unlikely to have adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). This rule is based on the fact that this particular functional group is commonly found in non-toxic compounds such as fatty acids.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains the substructure "Cc1nc(C)n(C)c1Oc1ccc(cc1)No", then it may have adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). This rule is based on the fact that this particular combination of functional groups is rarely found in non-toxic compounds but has been observed in some carcinogens like benzidine.

Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chloro group (-Cl) attached to a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). This rule applies to molecules C1CN=C(N1)NC2=C(C=C(C=C2Cl)N)Cl and CC1=CNN(C(=O)Nc1=O)c2ccc(cc2)n.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an aromatic ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps).

Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure CN(CCCl)CCCl or CC(CN1CC(=O)NC(=O)C1)N2CC(=O)NC(=O)C2, then it is likely to have side-effect activity related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule does not contain any of the substructures mentioned in Rule 1 but contains the substructure C(CS(=O)(=O)O)S or CCC1=CC=C(C=C1)O, then it is unlikely to have side-effect activity related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 0 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains both the substructure CN(CCCl)CCCl or CC(CN1CC(=O)NC(=O)C1)N2CC(=O)NC(=O)C2 and the substructure C(CS(=O)(=O)O)S or CCC1=CC=C(C=C1)O, then it may have some degree of uncertainty regarding its potential for causing adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). This rule applies to all molecules in the dataset.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). The presence of this functional group in certain drugs such as glipizide and glyburide has been linked to increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus which is a form of neoplasm.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). Nitro compounds such as nitrofurantoin and nifuroxime have been associated with increased risk of bladder cancer and skin cancer respectively.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). Fluorinated drugs such as fluoxetine and fluconazole have been linked to increased risk of developing certain types of cancer including breast cancer and colon cancer.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a benzene ring or any other aromatic system, it may have potential side effects on the human body due to its high reactivity towards biological systems. Therefore, compounds containing such structures should be avoided in drug design unless they are essential for the desired therapeutic action.
Rule 2: Compounds containing functional groups like aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters etc. may exhibit toxic effects if present in excess amounts. These groups can interact with proteins and enzymes leading to disruption of normal cellular processes. Hence, these groups need to be carefully evaluated during drug development process.
Rule 3: The presence of charged ions like calcium, silver, chloride, thallium etc. in a compound indicates that it has a higher likelihood of being reactive and potentially harmful to living organisms. Such compounds should be thoroughly tested before being used as drugs.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps):
Rule 1: If a molecule contains the substructure "Cl" or "Br" attached to a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). This rule applies to molecules C1, D1, E1, F1, G1, H1, I1, J1, K1, L1, M1, N1, O1, P1, Q1, R1, S1, T1, U1, V1, W1, X1, Y1, Z1, A2, B2, C2, D2, E2, F2, G2, H2, I2, J2, K2, L2, M2, N2, O2, P2, Q2, R2, S2, T2, U2, V2, W2, X2, Y2, Z2, AA2, AB2, AC2, AD2, AE2, AF2, AG2, AH2, AI2, AJ2, AK2, AL2, AM2, AN2, AO2, AP2, AQ2, AR2, AS2, AT2, AU2, AV2, AW2, AX2, AZ2

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps):
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having the potential to cause such adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorinated phenyl ring attached to a nitrogen atom through a single bond, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). The second molecule in the dataset contains this structural feature and has been labeled as having the potential to cause such adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains two negatively charged oxygen atoms connected by a double bond, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). The third molecule in the dataset does not contain this structural feature and has been labeled as not having the potential to cause such adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group C=NN=C in the molecular structure may indicate potential carcinogenicity or mutagenicity. This functional group is present in molecules labeled as 1 but absent in those labeled as 0.
Rule 2: The absence of any specific structural features such as aromatic rings, conjugated double bonds, or halogen substituents may suggest low toxicity. Molecules without these groups tend to be labeled as 0. However, this rule should be used cautiously since there could be other factors contributing to the observed effects.
Rule 3: The presence of certain chemical moieties such as sulfonamide, nitro, or amide groups may increase the likelihood of toxic effects. These groups are found in some molecules labeled as 1 but not in others. It is important to note that these rules are based on general trends and may not apply to all cases. Further analysis and experimentation would be necessary to establish a definitive relationship between molecular structures and their toxicological profiles.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps):
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure CN(C)CCC=C1C2=CC=CC=C2CCC3=CC=CC=C31, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). This rule was derived from the first SMILES string in the dataset which contains this specific substructure and has been labeled as having no adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure C1CC(CCC1CN)C(=O)O or CCC(=O)OC1(C(CC2C1(CC(C3(C2CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC43C)F)O)C)C)C(=O)CCl, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). These two substructures were found in the second and third SMILES strings respectively, both of which have been labeled as having no adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains the substructure CCON1CC(CC2C1CC3=CNC4=CC=CC2=C34)CSC 1 or C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCC(=O)O, then it may have

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a nitrate group (-ONO2), then it is likely to have side-effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have label 1 indicating their association with neoplasm-related side-effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a phenyl ring, then it is also likely to have side-effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). The third molecule in the dataset contains this structural feature and it also has label 1 indicating its association with neoplasm-related side-effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a thiadiazole ring, then it may not have any significant side-effects related to neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). None of the last four molecules in the dataset contain this structural feature and all of them have label 0 indicating no association with neoplasm-related side-effects.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of the functional group "CC(C)NCC(COC1=CC=C(C=C1)CCOC)O" in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects associated with neoplasm benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). The rule suggests that this particular functional group has a high probability of causing such adverse effects. However, it's important to note that this rule only provides a general indication and should be used as a starting point for further analysis rather than relying solely on its predictions.
Rule 2: If there is a presence of the functional group "CCCC[N+]1(C2CC(CC1C3C2O3)OC(=O)C(CO)C4=CC=CC=C4)C" in the molecular structure, then it may also lead to adverse effects associated with neoplasm benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). This rule suggests that this specific functional group could potentially have similar negative consequences as Rule 1. Again, caution must be exercised when using these rules since they are based on limited data and may not always accurately reflect actual outcomes.
Rule 3: If there is a presence of the functional group "CCN(CC)C(=O)[C@@]1(C[C@@H]1C[NH3+])C2=CC=CC=C2.[Cl-]" in the molecular structure, then it may indicate potential adverse effects associated with neoplasm benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps). While this rule suggests that this functional group may pose some risk, it's important to

Rule 3: If a compound contains both a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) and a halogen atom such as chlorine (-Cl), it may have a greater potential for causing adverse effects on neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) compared to compounds with only one of these functional groups. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "CC12CCC3C(C1CCC2O)CCC4=C3C=CC(=C4)OC(=O)N(CCCl)CCCl".
