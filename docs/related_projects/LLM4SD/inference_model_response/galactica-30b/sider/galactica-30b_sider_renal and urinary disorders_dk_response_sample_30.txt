Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as a carbonyl group (C=O) or a carboxylic acid group (COOH), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to at least two carbon atoms, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 in the dataset

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as "C(C=O)C(C=O)O" or "CC(C)C1=NC(=CS1)CN(C)C(=O)NC(CCN2CCOCC2)C(=O)NC(CCC(CC3=CC=CC=C3)NC(=O)OCC4=CN=CS4)CC5=CC=CC=C5", then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a functional group such as "CC(=O)[C@]1(CC[C@@H]2[C@@]1(CC[C@H]3[C@H]2CCC4=CC(=O)CC[C@]34C)C)O" or "CC1=C(C(=CC=C1)C)NC(=O)C2CCCCN2C", then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a functional group such as "C(C(CO)O)O" or "CC(=O)NC1=C(C(=C(C(=C1

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) or a phosphate group (-OPO3R2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The presence of these groups in a molecule can lead to the formation of metabolites that can accumulate in the body and cause damage to the kidneys.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. Carboxylic acids can irritate the skin and mucous membranes, which can lead to inflammation and irritation of the kidneys.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. Nitro compounds can cause methemoglobinemia, which can lead to tissue hypoxia and damage to the kidneys.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional groups such as amides or ureas in a compound, then it may have potential for causing adverse effects on kidneys due to their ability to bind to proteins and disrupt normal cellular processes. Therefore, compounds containing these functional groups should be labeled as having high risk of causing renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings may also pose a higher risk of causing adverse effects on kidneys if they contain substituents such as nitro or amino groups which can increase their polarity and water solubility. These types of compounds tend to accumulate in the body over time and can lead to damage to kidney tissues.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a compound's structure can also play a role in its potential to cause adverse effects. Longer chains of carbon atoms and more complex structures may make it harder for the body to break down and eliminate the compound, leading to accumulation and toxicity. Therefore, compounds with longer chain lengths and more complex structures should be labeled as having a higher risk of causing renal and urinary disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide, nitro, fluoride, and carboxylic acid in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on renal and urinary systems.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to bind to proteins or enzymes in the body, which could lead to unwanted reactions or disruptions in normal physiological processes. For example, the sulfonamide group found in some antibiotics has been known to cause kidney damage by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which is important for maintaining proper fluid balance in the kidneys.
Rule 2: A molecule containing conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings may also increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on renal and urinary systems.
Explanation: Conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings can enhance the stability and reactivity of a molecule, making it more likely to interact with biological molecules and disrupt their functions. For instance, certain dyes used in textiles have been linked to cases of acute kidney injury due to their ability to form crystals in the urine.
Rule 3: Molecules with a high degree of polarity or hydrophilicity may be less likely to cross the cell membrane and enter the bloodstream, reducing their potential to cause adverse effects on renal and urinary systems.
Explanation: Polar molecules tend to attract water molecules and are more soluble in aqueous solutions, which makes them less likely to accumulate in tissues or organs. Therefore, polar compounds like glucose and amino acids are generally considered safe for consumption even at high doses.

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The first molecule in the dataset containing this functional group is labeled as 1, which indicates that it does have such potential.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The second molecule in the dataset containing this functional group is labeled as 0, which suggests that it does not have such potential. However, it's important to note that this rule should only be considered as a general guideline and not a definitive predictor.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sodium ion (Na+) and an iodide ion (I-), it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The third molecule in the dataset containing these ions is labeled as 0, which supports this hypothesis.

Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom connected to a carbon atom through a single bond, and there exists at least one non-aromatic ring containing five or six atoms, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules 4 and 5.

The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels indicating their association with such disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (-C=O) through a single bond, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This structure is present in several other molecules in the dataset as well, all of which have labels indicating their association with such disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. None of the last four molecules in the dataset contain halogens, and none of them have labels indicating any association with such disorders.

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The second molecule in the dataset contains this type of structure and is labeled as having no potential for these types of adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine or chlorine) bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains this type of structure and is labeled as having the potential for these types of adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as a carboxylic acid or its derivatives, it may lead to adverse effects in the kidney and urinary system. The presence of these groups increases the polarity of the compound, which makes it more likely to be excreted through urine. This can result in irritation or inflammation of the bladder or kidneys.
Example: Molecule #9 has a carboxylic acid group, so it is labeled as 1 for causing adverse effects on the kidney and urinary system.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring or other aromatic rings, it may also contribute to adverse effects in the kidney and urinary system. These structures can increase the hydrophobicity of the compound, making it more likely to accumulate in tissues and cells. This can lead to cellular damage and tissue inflammation.
Example: Molecules #7 and #10 have aromatic rings, so they are both labeled as 1 for causing adverse effects on the kidney and urinary system.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, it may also contribute to adverse effects in the kidney and urinary system. Nitrogen-containing heterocycles can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions. They can also form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, increasing the solubility of the compound and making it more likely to be excreted through urine.
Example: Molecule #11 has a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, so it is labeled as 1 for causing adverse effects on the kidney and urinary system.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as a carbonyl group (C=O) or a carboxylic acid group (COOH), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to at least two carbon atoms, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 in the dataset

================================

Rule 1: If there is a nitro group (-NO2) present in the structure of a molecule, then it may have potential side effects on renal and urinary disorders. The presence of this functional group may increase the polarity of the molecule which could lead to its accumulation in the kidney tissue causing damage or irritation. Therefore, molecules containing such groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfhydryl group (-SH), it may also have potential side effects on renal and urinary disorders due to its ability to form covalent bonds with other proteins leading to their inactivation. Such compounds should therefore be used cautiously.
Rule 3: If a molecule has a negative charge at physiological pH, it may interact with positively charged ions like sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) in the body resulting in electrolyte imbalance and potentially affecting renal function. Therefore, neutral or slightly basic molecules should be preferred for therapeutic use.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules in rows 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have adverse effects on renal and urinary disorders. The presence of these functional groups in a compound can increase its acidity and polarity, which can lead to increased absorption through the kidneys and potential damage.
Example: Molecule A has a sulfonamide group and is labeled as having adverse effects on renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) conjugated with an alkene or alkyne group, then it may have adverse effects on renal and urinary disorders. This type of conjugation can increase the compound's hydrophobicity and make it more likely to be absorbed by the body.
Example: Molecule B has a carboxylic acid group conjugated with an alkene group and is labeled as having adverse effects on renal and urinary disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), then it may have adverse effects on renal and urinary disorders. Halogen atoms can increase the compound's lipophilicity and enhance its ability to cross cell membranes, including those of the kidney tubules.
Example: Molecule C has two chlorine atoms and is labeled as having adverse effects on renal and urinary disorders.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a nitro group (-NO2) present in the structure of a molecule, then it may have potential side effects on renal and urinary disorders. The presence of this functional group may increase the polarity of the molecule which could lead to its accumulation in the kidney tissue causing damage or irritation. Therefore, molecules containing such groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfhydryl group (-SH), it may also have potential side effects on renal and urinary disorders due to its ability to form covalent bonds with other proteins leading to their inactivation. Such compounds should therefore be used cautiously.

This structural feature appears in several molecules in the dataset, including the third one which is labeled as not having the potential for such effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amides, sulfonamides, and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on renal and urinary systems.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects on these systems due to their ability to bind to proteins and disrupt normal cellular processes.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound may also play a role in determining its potential to cause adverse effects on renal and urinary systems. Compounds with high molecular weights and hydrophobicities may be more likely to accumulate in tissues and organs, leading to toxicity.

================================



================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as a carboxylic acid or its derivatives, it may lead to adverse effects on kidneys and urine. The presence of this functional group increases the polarity of the compound, which makes it more likely to be excreted through the kidney. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be avoided in drug development.
Rule 2: Molecules having a high degree of conjugation between π bonds tend to have lower solubility in water and higher lipophilicity than those without conjugation. This property can increase their ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological systems. However, excessive conjugation can also make them less reactive and potentially toxic due to their low reactivity towards other molecules. Therefore, careful consideration must be given when designing drugs with highly conjugated structures.
Rule 3: A molecule's size and shape play important roles in determining its pharmacokinetic profile. Large and complex molecules often have poor membrane permeability and bioavailability compared to smaller ones. Additionally, certain structural features like aromatic rings and rigid structures can affect the molecule's metabolic stability and toxicity. Therefore, medicinal chemists need to carefully consider these factors while designing new drugs.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. The first four molecules in the dataset contain either one or both of these groups, so they all have the potential to cause such effects.

Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom connected to a carbon atom through a single bond, and there exists at least one non-aromatic ring containing five or six atoms, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders. This rule applies to molecules 4 and 5.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to renal and urinary disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom, then it is likely to have side-effects associated with renal and urinary disorders. The presence of a halogen like chlorine in a molecule can increase its lipophilicity, which may lead to increased absorption into the body and potentially harmful interactions with other molecules or tissues. Therefore, this rule suggests that caution should be exercised when using such compounds.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, as seen in the second and third SMILES strings provided, then it is more likely to have side-effects associated with renal and urinary disorders. Conjugated systems can enhance the reactivity of a molecule by allowing for easier electron transfer across multiple bonds. This increased reactivity can make the compound more susceptible to attack by other molecules or enzymes within the body, leading to unwanted reactions or toxicity.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), as seen in the last two SMILES strings provided, then it is highly likely to have side-effects associated with renal and urinary disorders. Sulfonamides are known to interfere with the production of folic acid, which is essential for the growth and repair of cells throughout the body. When taken in high doses, they can cause serious damage to the kidneys and other organs, particularly in individuals with impaired kidney function.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided in the given dataset and may not apply to all types of molecules or

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as a sulfonamide or a nitro group, then it may have adverse effects on the kidney and urinary system. The presence of these groups increases the chances of the molecule interacting with the kidneys and causing damage.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure has a high degree of conjugation, then it may also have adverse effects on the kidney and urinary system. Conjugation occurs when multiple functional groups are connected together through a chain of atoms. This increases the stability of the molecule but also makes it more likely to interact with other molecules in the body.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it may have adverse effects on the kidney and urinary system. Halogen atoms can increase the polarity of the molecule, making it more water-soluble and easier to excrete from the body. However, if they are present in excess or bonded to certain metals, they can be toxic and cause damage to the kidneys and other organs.
