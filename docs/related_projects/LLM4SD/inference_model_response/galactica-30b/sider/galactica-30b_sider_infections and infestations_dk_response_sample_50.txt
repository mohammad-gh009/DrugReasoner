Rule 1: If there exists a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects. The presence of this functional group can increase the reactivity of the molecule and interact with other molecules or tissues in the body, leading to potential toxicity. Therefore, molecules containing nitro groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, especially if it is substituted with electron-withdrawing groups such as -COOH, -CHO, or -NO2, it may also have adverse effects. These substituents can increase the reactivity of the aromatic ring and make it more susceptible to oxidation or reduction reactions, which can lead to toxic effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule has a long carbon chain or multiple rings, it may have poor solubility in water and may accumulate in the body over time, leading to potential toxicity. Therefore, molecules with these structural features should be used cautiously or avoided altogether.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to infections and infestations. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels of 1, indicating their potential side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may also have potential side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to the third molecule in the dataset, which has a label of 1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbamate group (-O-CO-NH-), then it may not have any significant side effects related to infections and infestations. None of the last four molecules in the dataset contain this group, and all of them have labels of 0.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the functional group C(CS(=O)(=O)O)S or CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C3(C(CC2(C1(C(=O)CO)O)C)O)F)C, then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the functional group [H+].[H+].[H+].CC1=NC=C(C(=C1[O-])CN(CCN(CC2=C(C(=NC=C2COP(=O)([O-])[O-])C)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])COP(=O)([O-])[O-].[Na+].[Na+].[Na+].[Mn+2], then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains the functional group CCCN1CCN(CC1)C2=CC=C(C=C2)OCC3COC(O3)(CN4C=NC=N4)C5=C(C=C(C=C5)Cl)Cl,

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the first molecule listed above contains both a sulfonamide group and a nitro group, so it meets this criterion.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) conjugated with an aromatic ring, then it may also have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" in the dataset. For example, the third molecule listed above contains such a conjugation, but does not contain either a sulfonamide group nor a nitro group, so it only partially meets this criterion.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrile group (-CN) adjacent to an aromatic ring, then it may also have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the last molecule listed above contains such a configuration, which makes it meet this criterion.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a similar functional group, then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. The first two molecules in the dataset contain such groups and they both have labels of 1, indicating their potential side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a guanidine group (-CNHC(=NH)NH-) or a similar functional group, then it may also have side effects related to infections and infestations. The third molecule in the dataset contains such a group and it also has a label of 1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a similar functional group, then it may have negative effects on the body's immune system and increase the risk of infection. However, this rule should be used cautiously as there are many other factors that can affect the toxicity of a molecule. The last four molecules in the dataset contain such groups but only one of them has a label of 1 while the others have labels of 0.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a sulfonamide group present in the structure of the molecule, then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. The presence of this functional group indicates that the compound has antimicrobial or antiparasitic properties which could lead to these types of side effects.
Rule 2: If there is a fluoroquinolone group present in the structure of the molecule, then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This functional group is known for its broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and could potentially cause adverse reactions in some individuals.
Rule 3: If there is a nitro group present in the structure of the molecule, then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. Nitro compounds are often used as antibiotics due to their potent antimicrobial properties but they can also be toxic at high doses. Therefore, it is important to monitor for any potential side effects when using such compounds.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules #1, #2, #3, #4,

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects associated with infection and infestation.
Explanation: Sulfonamides and nitro groups are known for their antimicrobial activities, which can be harmful if taken in excess amounts. These functional groups can interfere with the growth of bacteria by inhibiting certain enzymes involved in the metabolic processes of microorganisms. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be used carefully as they may lead to adverse reactions such as hypersensitivity, skin rashes, and other allergic responses.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure has a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an aromatic ring, then it may also have potential side effects associated with infection and infestation.
Explanation: Conjugated systems like this one can increase the electron density on the aromatic ring, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack from biological macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. This can result in undesirable interactions between the drug and the body's cells, leading to toxicity and other adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may potentially interact with the thyroid gland, causing hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.
Explanation: Halogen atoms can act as weak bases and form hydrogen bonds with the amino acid residues present in the thyroxine hormone receptor protein. This can disrupt the normal functioning of the thyroid gland and affect the production of thyroid hormones, leading to various health problems including goiter, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to two carbon atoms in a linear arrangement, then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules numbered 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of chlorine atom in the structure, then it may lead to adverse effects. The first molecule has a chlorine atom present which makes it potentially harmful for use as a drug candidate. Therefore, we need to be cautious while using such molecules.
Rule 2: If there is a presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in the structure, then it may also lead to adverse effects. The second molecule has a nitro group present which makes it potentially harmful for use as a drug candidate. Therefore, we need to be cautious while using such molecules.
Rule 3: If there is a presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in the structure, then it may lead to adverse effects. The third molecule has a sulfonamide group present which makes it potentially harmful for use as a drug candidate. Therefore, we need to be cautious while using such molecules.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group called "carbonyl" (represented by the symbol "C=O" in the SMILES notation), then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a metal ion such as sodium or indium, then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules 2 and 21.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (represented by the symbols "SO2NH" or "R-SO2NR'" in the SMILES notation), then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules 3 and 4.
Note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the given dataset and should be used with caution until further validation is performed.

================================

Rule 1: If there is presence of functional group like "-NO2" or "-COOH" in the structure of a molecule, then it may have potential for causing adverse effects on human body.
Explanation: These functional groups are known to be toxic and can cause irritation, inflammation etc. in the body when present in high concentrations. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile before being used as drugs.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains multiple aromatic rings, it may also have potential for causing adverse effects due to their planar nature which allows them to interact easily with other molecules.
Explanation: Aromatic rings are often associated with toxicity because they can bind to proteins and disrupt normal cellular processes. Molecules containing multiple aromatic rings should therefore be evaluated cautiously for their safety.
Rule 3: If a molecule has a long carbon chain or a complex ring system, it may be less likely to cause adverse effects compared to smaller molecules with simpler structures.
Explanation: Longer chains and more complex ring systems tend to make molecules larger and more difficult to penetrate cell membranes. They may also be less susceptible to degradation by enzymes in the body. However, this rule is only a general guideline and individual cases must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to infections and infestations. The first example in the dataset contains both groups and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom bonded to an aromatic ring, then it may also have potential side effects related to infections and infestations. The second example in the dataset contains this feature and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds between carbon atoms, then it may also have potential side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules like the third example in the dataset which contain a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to two alkene groups (-CH=CH-) through a single bond (-C-).

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like amide or amine in the structure of a molecule, then it may have potential for causing adverse effects on human body. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1C(C(C(C(C(C1NC(=O)C(CCN)O)OC2C(C(C(C(O2)CO)O)N)O)O)OC3C(C(C(C(O3)CN)O)O)O)N 0, CCC(=O)NC[C@@H]1C[C@@H]1C2=C3CCOC3=CC=C2 1, CCCCCCOC(=O)N=C(C1=CC=C(C=C1)NCC2=NC3=C(N2C)C=CC(=C3)C(=O)N(CCC(=O)OCC)C4=CC=CC=N4)N 1, CC[C@H](C)[C@H]1C(=O)NC(C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@@H](CSSCCC(=O)N[C@@H](C(=O)N1)CC2=CC=C(C=C2)OCC)C(=O)N3CCC[C@H]3C(=O)N[C@@H](CCCN)C(=O)NCC(=O)N)CC(=O)N)[C@@H](C)O 0, CC1=C(C(=CC=C1)C)NC(=O)C2CCCCN2C 1, COC(=O)C)OC(=O)C1=C(CS[C@H]2N1C(=O)[C@H]2NC(=O)C(=NOC)C3=CC=CO3)COC(=O)N 1, CN 1, NC2=C(C=C(C=C2)[N+](=O)[O-])C(=N1)C3=CC=CC=C3 1, CCS1(=O)C2=C(C=C(C=C2)S(=O)(=O)O)C(=O)N1C4=CC=CC=C4 1, O=C(Nc1ccc(cc1Oc1ccccc1Sc1ccc(nc2ncssc2)no1)s1)c1ccccc1 1, N1C(=NNC(=O)C2=CC=CC=C2)C(=O)N(C(=O)N1C)C 1, c1ccc(cn1)C(C)(C)C 1, NCC(=O)ON1C(=O)C2=C(C=C(C=C2)Cl)C1=O 1, OC(C)(C)C1(C(=O)OC)C(=O)OC2C(C(C(C(O2

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in the para position relative to a nitrogen atom in an aromatic ring system, then it is likely to have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1=NC2=C(N1[C@H]3[C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O3)CO)O)F)N=C(N=C2N)Cl 1 and CC(=O)NC1=CC=C(C=C1)O 1.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring system, then it is also likely to have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CN(C)C(=O)OC1=CC=CC(=C1)[N+](C)(C)C 0 and CCC1CC2C3CC(C4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C3(C(CC2(C1(C(=O)COC(=O)C)OC(=O)C)C)O)F)C)F 1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a urea group (-NH-CO-NH-), then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CC(CO)NC(=O)C1CN(C2CC3=CNC4=CC=CC(=C34)C2=C1)C 1 and CC(C)CC(C(=O)

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have side effects related to infections and infestations. The second molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains both a sulfonamide group and a nitro group, then it is more likely to have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule combines Rules 1 and 2 by adding another structural feature that is associated with these side effects. All molecules containing both groups have been labeled as having such side effects.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a guanidine group (-CNHC(=NH)NH-), then it may have potential side effects associated with infections and infestations. The presence of these groups in the chemical structure indicates that the compound has antimicrobial properties which can be beneficial for treating bacterial infections but can also lead to adverse reactions such as hypersensitivity reactions or skin rashes.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains two positively charged phosphorus atoms connected by a single bond, then it may have potential side effects associated with infections and infestations. This type of structure is commonly found in organophosphorus compounds which are known to have insecticidal and fungicidal properties. However, exposure to high levels of these compounds can cause adverse health effects such as respiratory distress, seizures, and even death.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (-C=O) through a double bond, then it may not have any significant side effects associated with infections and infestations. This type of structure is commonly found in flavonoids, a class of plant compounds that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. While some studies suggest that flavonoids may have potential benefits for preventing certain types of cancer and cardiovascular diseases, their safety and efficacy in humans remain unclear.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it is likely to have side effects related to infections and infestations. The first example in the dataset contains both groups and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to a double bond, then it is also likely to have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule is based on the second example in the dataset which contains this structural feature and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to a nitrogen atom through two single bonds, then it may not have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule is based on the last example in the dataset which does not contain any of the other features mentioned above but still has been labeled as not having these side effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects. For example, molecules containing nitro groups or sulfonyl groups have been known to cause allergic reactions. Therefore, if a molecule contains such functional groups, it should be labeled as having the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule may also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects. For instance, large molecules may be more likely to cross cell membranes and interact with biological systems than smaller ones. Therefore, if a molecule is relatively large compared to others in its class, it may be more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: The charge on a molecule may affect its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with other molecules. For example, charged molecules may require specific transporters to cross cell membranes, while neutral molecules may diffuse through them more easily. Therefore, if a molecule has a net charge, it may be less likely to cause adverse effects unless it possesses special properties that allow it to cross cell membranes.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as "-NO2" or "-COOH", then it has the potential to cause adverse effects in humans. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, the first molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) which may cause allergic reactions or other health issues if ingested or inhaled.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring, then it also has the potential to cause adverse effects in humans. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For instance, the third molecule contains a phenyl group (-C6H5) which is a type of benzene ring. Phenyl groups have been linked to various health hazards including cancer and reproductive problems.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it has the potential to cause adverse effects in humans. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the given dataset. The sixth molecule contains a sulfonamide group which is commonly found in antibiotics and can cause skin rashes, liver damage, and other serious health problems.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a thiadiazole ring (-C2N2S-), then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. The first example in the dataset contains both these groups and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may also have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to the second example in the dataset which contains a nitro group and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrile group (-CN) adjacent to an aromatic ring, then it may also have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to the third example in the dataset which contains a nitrile group and has been labeled as having such side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in a benzene ring, then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to the first SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms in a six-membered ring, and the ring is not part of a larger structure, then it may not have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to the second SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 0.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom in a five-membered ring, and the ring is part of a larger structure containing a carbonyl group, then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to the third SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 1.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide or nitro group in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the body. Therefore, compounds containing these functional groups should be labeled as having high risk of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings conjugated with carbonyl groups have higher probability of being toxic than those without conjugation. Hence, they should also be labeled as having high risk of causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with long carbon chains or bulky structures may have lower solubility in water and hence less likely to cross cell membranes easily compared to smaller molecules. They may therefore pose lesser risks of causing adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular formula contains iron atoms or calcium ions, then it has no relation to infection and infestation activities.
Explanation: Iron and calcium ions do not have any direct impact on infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites etc. Therefore, molecules containing these elements cannot be associated with such activities.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) in its structure, then it may have some potential for causing adverse effects related to infections and infestations.
Explanation: Nitro groups are known to exhibit antimicrobial properties due to their ability to disrupt cellular respiration processes in microorganisms. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group could potentially possess anti-infective properties. However, further research would be required to confirm this hypothesis.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom, then it may also have some potential for causing adverse effects related to infections and infestations.
Explanation: Fluorine atoms are known to increase the lipophilicity of organic compounds, which can enhance their ability to penetrate cell membranes and interact with intracellular targets. Therefore, molecules containing fluorinated substituents could potentially possess enhanced biological activity against pathogens. Again, further research would be required to confirm this hypothesis.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom in the ring system, then it may have potential side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules numbered 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a similar functional group, it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. The presence of this group in certain antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole is known to cause allergic reactions in some people.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have side effects related to infections and infestations. Nitro compounds are commonly used as disinfectants and antiseptics but can also cause skin irritation and other adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it may have side effects related to infections and infestations due to its ability to disrupt cell membranes and cause tissue damage. This group is present in many common antibiotics such as penicillin and cephalosporin.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) or carboxylic acid group (COOH) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects. This is because these functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions.
Rule 2: A compound containing multiple rings or aromatic structures may have higher chances of causing adverse effects due to their ability to bind strongly to biological targets.
Rule 3: Compounds with long carbon chains or bulky substituents may be less likely to cause adverse effects compared to those with smaller or more polar substituents. This is because they may have lower affinity towards biological receptors and require higher concentrations to exhibit toxic effects.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a phosphorus atom bonded to two carbon atoms in a ring, then it may have potential side effects associated with infections and infestations. The presence of this functional group suggests that the compound could interact with biological molecules such as DNA or proteins, leading to negative health outcomes.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a sulfur atom bonded to one oxygen atom and one carbon atom, then it may also have potential side effects associated with infections and infestations. This functional group is commonly found in antibiotics like penicillin and other antimicrobial agents. It is likely that these compounds interfere with the growth and reproduction of bacteria by disrupting their cell walls or membranes.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a gold atom, then it may be toxic due to its ability to bind to thiol groups on proteins and enzymes, causing them to malfunction. This property has been exploited in cancer therapy, where gold-based drugs are used to target and destroy cancerous cells. However, exposure to high levels of gold can also lead to serious health problems such as kidney damage and neurological disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects. For example, molecules containing nitro groups or halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine have been known to exhibit toxic or carcinogenic properties. Therefore, if a molecule contains these functional groups, it should be labeled as having a high likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: The structure of a molecule plays a crucial role in determining its biological activity. A molecule's shape, size, and polarity can affect how it interacts with other molecules within the body. For instance, molecules with a planar structure tend to be more lipophilic and can cross cell membranes easily, leading to increased bioavailability and toxicity. On the other hand, molecules with a non-planar structure may be less likely to penetrate cells and cause adverse effects. Therefore, if a molecule has a highly polar or non-planar structure, it may be less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: The molecular weight of a compound can also influence its ability to cause adverse effects. Generally, larger molecules tend to be more hydrophobic and can accumulate in tissues, leading to toxicity. However, there is no specific cut-off value for molecular weight above which a substance becomes toxic. Therefore, this rule should be used cautiously when predicting the potential adverse effects of a molecule based on its molecular weight.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F) in a compound may increase its toxicity. Therefore, if a molecule contains these groups, it should be labeled as having the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound may also affect its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets. Generally, molecules with higher molecular weights and lower hydrophilicity tend to have poorer membrane permeability and bioavailability. Therefore, compounds with high molecular weights and low logP values (a measure of lipophilicity) should be considered less likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: The structure of a molecule may also play a role in determining its potential for causing adverse effects. For instance, some compounds may exhibit their toxic effects through specific interactions with cellular receptors or enzymes. Therefore, if a molecule has a structural feature that is known to interact with a particular target, it should be labeled as potentially harmful.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a nitro group (-NO2) in the structure of a molecule, then it may have adverse effects on human health. The presence of this functional group increases the reactivity of the molecule and can lead to toxic or carcinogenic effects. Therefore, molecules containing nitro groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it may also have potential adverse effects on human health. Sulfonyl groups can react with proteins and enzymes in the body, leading to allergic reactions or other negative consequences. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using such compounds.
Rule 3: If a molecule has a long carbon chain or multiple rings, it may have poor solubility in water and may accumulate in the body over time. This can lead to toxicity and other negative effects. Therefore, molecules with these structural features should be used cautiously or avoided altogether.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional groups such as nitro group or halogen atoms like fluorine, chlorine etc. in the structure of the molecule, then it may have potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecular weight of the compound is high, it may indicate that the compound has more complex structures which could lead to increased chances of toxicity.
Rule 3: The presence of certain rings in the chemical structure of the molecule may also increase its potential to cause adverse effects. For example, compounds containing benzene ring or heterocyclic rings like thiophene, pyrrole etc. may be toxic.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of fluorine atoms in the structure may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 containing C-F bonds such as CF3 or C-CF3 groups. These functional groups have been known to affect the biological activity of compounds by altering their lipophilicity, metabolic stability, and binding affinity towards target proteins.
Rule 2: The presence of negatively charged ions such as carboxylate or phosphate groups in the molecular structure may also increase the risk of adverse effects. Molecules labeled as 1 containing these functional groups may interact with positively charged amino acid residues on protein surfaces, leading to changes in protein conformation and function.
Rule 3: The absence of specific structural features such as aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may decrease the probability of causing adverse effects. Molecules labeled as 0 lacking these moieties may exhibit lower toxicity due to reduced reactivity and increased stability under physiological conditions.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to two carbon atoms in a linear arrangement, then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings F 0, C1=CC(=C(C=C1Cl)O)OC2=C(C=C(C=C2)Cl)Cl 0, CC1=CC=CC=C1O[C@H](CCNC)C2=CC=CC=C2.Cl 1, and C1=NC2=C(N1COC(CO)CO)NC(=NC2=O)N 1.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a phosphorus atom bonded to one oxygen atom and one carbon atom in a bent configuration, then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CC1C(O1)P(=O)(O)O 1 and CCC(C(=O)NC(C(C)C)C(=O)O)NC(=O)CNC(=O)C(CCC(=O)N)NC(=O)C(CC(C)C)NC(=O)C(CC(C)C)NC(=O)C(CCCNC(=N)N)NC(=O)C(CCC(=O)N)NC(=O)C

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) in conjugation with a double bond or aromatic ring, then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules 5 and 6.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules 7 and 8.
Note that these rules are just suggestions based on the limited information provided in the dataset. It's important to consult medical literature and experts for accurate predictions about specific compounds.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains iron (Fe) or gold (Au) atoms in its structure, then it is likely to have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfhydryl group (-SH), then it is unlikely to have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 0 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains fluorine (F) atom in its structure, then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. However, this rule is less certain than Rule 1 and requires further validation. It applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the dataset.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (represented by the SMILES string "SO2NH" or "R-SO2NR'" where R and R' are any organic groups), then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule is based on the fact that sulfonamides are antibiotics commonly used to treat bacterial infections.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a bromine atom (represented by the SMILES string "Br") attached to a carbon atom in the ortho position relative to a hydroxyl group (represented by the SMILES string "OH"), then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule is based on the fact that many antibacterial agents contain halogen atoms such as bromine, which can enhance their antimicrobial activity.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (represented by the SMILES string "NO2"), then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule is based on the fact that nitro compounds are often used as disinfectants and antiseptics due to their strong oxidizing properties.
Note that these rules are just examples and should not be used as the only criteria for predicting side effects. It is important to consider other factors such as dosage, duration of use, and individual patient characteristics when evaluating the safety of a drug.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a similar functional group, then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. The first two molecules in the dataset contain such groups and have labels of 1, indicating they do have these side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may also have side effects related to infections and infestations. This is because many antibiotics and other drugs that have this type of structure are known to have these types of side effects. The third molecule in the dataset contains such a group and has a label of 1, indicating it does have these side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a calcium ion (Ca+2), then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations due to its role in cell signaling and communication. However, this rule should be taken with caution as there are many other factors that can affect how a molecule interacts with cells and potentially cause side effects. The last molecule in the dataset contains a Ca+2 ion but has a label of 0, indicating it does not have these side effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a compound increases its chances of causing adverse effects. This rule applies to compounds 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 12

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have side effects associated with infections and infestations. The given SMILES string for compound number 6 has this functional group and therefore has been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a conjugated system of double bonds, such as in compound numbers 7 and 8, then it may be more likely to have side effects due to its reactivity. However, this rule alone cannot accurately predict if the molecule will have any specific side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a halogen atom, such as chlorine or fluorine, attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group, such as in compounds 9 and 10, then it may have side effects associated with infections and infestations. This is because halogens can increase the reactivity of molecules and potentially interact with biological systems.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains iodine atoms or fluorine atoms, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in relation to infections and infestations. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, the first molecule in the list contains two iodine atoms and one fluorine atom, which may contribute to its ability to cause adverse effects on infections and infestations.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects on the central nervous system. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, the second molecule in the list contains a nitro group attached to a benzene ring, which may contribute to its ability to cause adverse effects on the central nervous system.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects on the human body. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as either 0 or 1 in the given dataset. For example, the third molecule in the list contains a sulfonamide group, which may contribute to its ability to cause adverse effects on the human body. However, this rule should be used cautiously because some sulfonamide drugs have been widely used for treating bacterial infections without any significant adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a nitrate ion (NO3-), it may have potential side effects on infections and infestations. This rule applies to the first SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If a compound has a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom in a cyclic structure, it may also have potential side effects on infections and infestations. This rule applies to the second SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 1.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a thiocyanate group (-SCN) or a cyanate ion (OCN-), it may not have any significant side effects on infections and infestations. This rule applies to the fifth SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 0.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in the structure C1=CC(=CC=C1CSC(CN2C=CN=C2)C3=C(C=C(C=C3)Cl)Cl)Cl or C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)OOC(=O)C2=CC=CC=C2 then it may have potential side effects related to infections and infestations.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a functional group consisting of two carbonyl groups connected by a single bond in the form of CC(C)NCC(COC1=CC=C(C=C1)COCCOC(C)C)O or CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)CC then it may have potential side effects related to infections and infestations.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to one of the carbon atoms in the structure CC1CC2C3CC(C4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C3(C(CC2(C1(C(=O)COC(=O)C)OC(=O)C)C)O)F)C)F or COC1=C(C=C2C(=C1)C(=NC(=N2)N3CCN(CC3)C(=O)C4=CC=CO4)N)OC or CN1C2=C(C(=O)N(C1=O)C)NC=N2.C[N+](C)(C)CCO or C(C(C(=O)[O-])[S-])C(=O)[O-].[Na+].[Na+].[Au+] or

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a five-membered ring structure with one double bond (i.e., a pyrrole or furan ring), then it may have potential side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may have potential side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 in the dataset.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to infections and infestations. The first example in the dataset contains both groups and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a conjugated double bond system, then it may also have potential side effects related to infections and infestations. The second example in the dataset contains these features and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a guanidine group (-CN2H-), then it may have potential side effects related to infections and infestations. The third example in the dataset contains this group and has been labeled as having such side effects.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a carbonyl group (COR) connected to a nitrogen atom through a single bond, then it may have side effects associated with infection and infestation. The presence of these functional groups in a compound indicates that it has the potential to interact with biological molecules such as proteins and enzymes, which could lead to negative consequences for the body.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a nitro group (NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may also have side effects associated with infection and infestation. Nitro compounds are known to be toxic and can cause tissue damage if they enter the bloodstream. They can also act as irritants and cause inflammation in the skin.
Rule 3: If a compound contains two or more oxygen atoms bonded together, either in a chain or in a ring structure, then it may have side effects associated with infection and infestation. Oxygen-containing functional groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions. Additionally, some oxygenated compounds may be highly reactive and unstable, which could make them more likely to cause harm when introduced into the body.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular formula contains chlorine or sodium ions, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects. This rule can be applied to molecules with labels 1 in rows 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a functional group such as carbonyl, carboxyl, or sulfonyl groups, then it may have a higher chance of causing adverse effects. This rule can be applied to molecules with labels 1 in rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a heterocyclic ring structure, then it may also have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects. This rule can be applied to molecules with labels 1 in rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular formula contains chlorine atoms or fluorine atoms, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects. The presence of these atoms in a compound often indicates its reactivity and ability to form strong bonds with other molecules. Therefore, such compounds may have toxic or harmful effects on living organisms.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains functional groups like sulfonyl groups, carbonyl groups, or nitro groups, then it has a higher chance of causing adverse effects. These functional groups can interact with biological systems and disrupt their normal functioning. For example, sulfonyl groups can bind to proteins and alter their structure and function, while carbonyl groups can react with amino acids to form adducts.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains multiple rings or complex structures, then it also has a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects. Such molecules may be more resistant to degradation and have longer half-lives, which can lead to accumulation and toxicity. Additionally, they may have a greater affinity for specific receptors or enzymes, leading to more pronounced effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to infections and infestations:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure CNS(=O)(=O) or C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N, then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules in rows 2, 6, and 9 of the table.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure CC(CC1=CC=CC=C1)N or CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)O[C@H]1CC[C@@H]2[C@@]1(CC[C@H]3[C@H]2CCC4=CC(=O)CC[C@]34C)C, then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules in row 7 and 10 of the table.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains the substructure CN(CC(CO)O)C(=O)C1=C(C(=C(C(=C1I)C(=O)NCC(CO)O)I)NC(=O)COC)I, then it may have side effects related to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules in row 8 of the table.
Note that these rules are based solely on the provided

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular formula contains chlorine or sodium ions, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in relation to infections and infestations. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the given dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds between carbon atoms, such as in the second example, then it also has a high probability of causing adverse effects due to its ability to interact with biological systems. However, this rule may not be applicable for all types of conjugated systems.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a benzene ring, as in the fifth example, then it has a moderate probability of causing adverse effects due to its potential to act as an oxidizing agent. However, this rule may not apply to other types of nitro groups or aromatic rings.
It's important to note that these rules are based on limited information and should be used cautiously when predicting the toxicity of new compounds. It's always best to consult with experts in the field of toxicology before making any decisions about the safety of novel chemicals.
