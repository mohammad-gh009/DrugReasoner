Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amines and amides in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the nervous system. This rule can be applied to compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system due to their ability to interact with biological molecules through π-π stacking interactions. This rule can be applied to compounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound may also play a role in determining its potential to cause adverse effects on the nervous system. Generally, larger and more hydrophobic compounds tend to have greater bioavailability and may be more likely to cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to neurological effects. However, this rule should be used cautiously since other factors such as charge and hydrogen bonding capacity can also affect permeability across membranes. This rule can be applied to compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) and cyano group (-CN) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also have a higher likelihood of exhibiting neurological side effects.
Rule 3: Compounds having polar functional groups like hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH2), and carboxyl (-COOH) may be less likely to cross the blood-brain barrier and affect the central nervous system.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) and has a negative charge on one of its oxygen atoms, then it may have side effects related to nervous system disorders. The first example in the dataset contains such a structure and has been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a nitro group (NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, and if there is also a carbonyl group (C=O) adjacent to the nitro group, then it may be associated with side effects related to nervous system disorders. The second example in the dataset contains this structure and has been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 3: If a compound contains two chlorine atoms bonded to the same carbon atom, and if at least one of those chlorine atoms is bonded to another nitrogen atom, then it may not be associated with side effects related to nervous system disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, nitro, and carbonyl groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to various health problems including neurological disorders. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles before being used in therapeutic applications.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also exhibit neurotoxic effects due to their ability to penetrate cell membranes and interfere with cellular processes.
Explanation: Aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds are often found in drugs and other chemicals that are designed to interact with specific targets within cells. However, if these structures are present in high concentrations or are highly reactive, they may cause unintended damage to cellular components such as proteins and DNA.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound may also play a role in determining its neurotoxicity. Generally, larger and more hydrophobic molecules tend to have greater access to the central nervous system and may be more likely to cause adverse effects.

Therefore, these molecules should be labeled as having a high likelihood of causing neurological side effects.
Rule 2: The presence of calcium ions in the molecular structure suggests that the compound could have a role in regulating cellular processes within the body's cells or tissues. However, if this ion is present in conjunction with other structural features that suggest toxicity, then there is a higher probability of adverse reactions occurring.
Rule 3: Molecules containing sodium and iodide ions do not necessarily imply any specific biological function but rather reflect the chemical composition of the environment where they were synthesized or isolated. These compounds would likely not exhibit any significant physiological impact under normal conditions.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) and halogen atoms like chlorine (Cl) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: Carbonyl group is known to interact with biological molecules and alter their function. Chlorine atom is also known to be toxic and can disrupt normal cellular processes. Therefore, compounds containing these functional groups may have a higher chance of interacting with neural tissues and causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: Compounds with complex ring structures or multiple conjugated double bonds may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: Complex rings or conjugated double bonds can increase the lipophilicity of a compound, making it more likely to cross the blood-brain barrier and interact with neural tissue. This can lead to neurotoxicity and other adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of certain chemical elements such as gold (Au) or sulfur (S) in a compound may indicate a high likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: Gold and sulfur are both highly reactive and can form strong covalent bonds with other molecules. These interactions can potentially disrupt normal biochemical pathways and cause toxicity. Therefore, compounds containing these elements should be evaluated carefully for their potential to cause adverse effects on the nervous system.

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) and double bonds (C=C) in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: These functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to negative consequences. For example, the carbonyl group present in the second molecule can form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues in proteins, altering their structure and function. Similarly, the double bond present in the first molecule can react with free radicals or other reactive species, leading to oxidative stress and cellular damage.
Rule 2: Molecules containing heterocyclic rings such as pyridine, pyrimidine, and imidazole have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: Heterocyclic rings contain both carbon and nitrogen atoms, making them more polar and capable of interacting with biological molecules. They also possess unique chemical properties that can affect protein folding and enzyme activity, leading to negative consequences. For instance, the third molecule contains a pyrazole ring, which has been shown to inhibit acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme involved in neurotransmitter metabolism.
Rule 3: Molecules with a high degree of lipophilicity tend to cross the blood-brain barrier more easily and cause adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: Lipophilic molecules can dissolve in cell membranes and interfere with membrane fluidity, ion channel function, and receptor binding. They can also accumulate in tissues and cause toxic effects over time. For example, the last molecule contains a long chain fatty acid ester, which is highly lipophilic and can penetrate the brain tissue.
