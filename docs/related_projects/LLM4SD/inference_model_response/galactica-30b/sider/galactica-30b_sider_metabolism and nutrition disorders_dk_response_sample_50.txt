The presence of this structural feature in the molecule suggests that it may interfere with normal metabolic processes or affect nutrient absorption.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfhydryl group (-SH), then it may have side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This functional group is known to interact with other molecules and can disrupt their function.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a phosphorus atom bonded to four carbon atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement, then it may have side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This structural feature is commonly found in phospholipids, which are essential components of cell membranes. Interference with membrane integrity or function could lead to adverse effects on cellular metabolism or nutrient transport.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as CCC(=O)O or CC(C(=O)NC(C(=O)NS(=O)(=O)O)Cc1ccc(cc1)Oc1ccccc1)OS(=O)(=O)C, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as Cl or F, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a metal ion such as Fe+3 or Na+, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders.
Note that these rules are based solely on the provided dataset and may not be applicable in all cases. It's important to consult medical professionals for accurate information about specific molecules and their potential health risks.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels of 1, indicating that they do have potential side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, then it may also have potential side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains a chlorine atom and it has a label of 1, indicating that it does have potential side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, then it may also have potential side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. The fourth molecule in the dataset contains a conjugated system of double bonds and it has a label of 1, indicating that it does have potential side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a functional group such as carboxylic acid or its derivatives, it may have metabolic and nutritional disorder side effects. The presence of this functional group indicates that the compound could be involved in biochemical reactions within the body, which could lead to negative health outcomes if the reaction is out of control. For example, the first SMILES string has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), so it is likely to have these types of side effects.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings may also have metabolic and nutritional disorder side effects due to their ability to interact with biological molecules. This interaction can disrupt normal cellular processes and lead to negative health outcomes. For instance, the fourth SMILES string has an aromatic ring (-C6H5), making it more likely to have these types of side effects.
Rule 3: Compounds with nitrogen-containing functional groups, such as amines or amides, may also have metabolic and nutritional disorder side effects. These functional groups can participate in chemical reactions within the body and interfere with normal physiological functions. For example, the sixth SMILES string has an amine group (-NH3+), indicating that it may have these types of side effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and nitro groups in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on metabolism and nutrition disorders.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to interact with biological systems and disrupt normal metabolic processes. For example, the sulfonyl group present in the first SMILES string has been shown to bind to receptors involved in glucose regulation, leading to hypoglycemia or low blood sugar levels.
Rule 2: A molecule containing multiple rings or fused ring structures may also increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on metabolism and nutrition disorders.
Explanation: Rings and fused ring structures can affect the molecular geometry and electronic distribution of a compound, which can impact its ability to interact with biological targets. For instance, the second SMILES string contains two benzene rings connected by a double bond, which may contribute to its toxicity due to increased reactivity and hydrophobicity.
Rule 3: The presence of certain atoms or atom types in a molecule may also influence its potential to cause adverse effects. For example, the third SMILES string contains chlorine, which is often associated with environmental pollutants and toxicants. Additionally, the fourth SMILES string contains a sulfur atom, which is commonly found in drugs and other biologically active compounds but can also lead to adverse reactions if overconsumed or misused.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) or carboxylic acid group (COOH) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on metabolism and nutrition disorders. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1. For example, in the first SMILES string, there is a carbonyl group present which could potentially lead to metabolic disturbances if consumed orally.
Rule 2: The absence of certain functional groups or structural features in a compound may decrease its likelihood of causing adverse effects. Molecules without any functional groups or specific structures, such as those represented by SMILES strings labeled as 0, tend to have lower toxicity profiles compared to compounds containing functional groups or structural motifs associated with toxicity. Therefore, this rule can be used to identify molecules that are less likely to cause adverse effects based on their chemical structure.
Rule 3: The position and orientation of functional groups within a compound can also affect its biological activity and toxicity profile. For instance, the second SMILES string contains two chlorine atoms attached to the same carbon atom, which may enhance its reactivity and potential for causing adverse effects. Similarly, the third SMILES string has a nitro group (NO2) attached to a benzene ring, which is known to be toxic and carcinogenic. Therefore, understanding the spatial arrangement of functional groups in a compound is important when predicting its potential toxicity.

Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 14 and 15 in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects. For example, molecules containing sulfur or selenium atoms have been associated with metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity. Similarly, compounds containing arsenic or mercury ions have been linked to neurological damage and developmental abnormalities. Therefore, identifying these functional groups in a molecule could be used as a preliminary screening tool to identify potential risks.
Rule 2: The structure of a molecule can also play a role in determining its toxicity. For instance, molecules with a high degree of branching or ring structures may be more resistant to degradation by enzymes and may accumulate in tissues, leading to toxic effects. Additionally, the length and flexibility of a molecule's carbon chain can affect its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets.
Rule 3: The chemical reactivity of a molecule can influence its potential for causing adverse effects. For example, reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide can react with cellular components and cause oxidative stress, which has been implicated in various diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, assessing the reactivity of a molecule using computational methods or experimental assays could provide valuable insights into its potential toxicity.

Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. The presence of these functional groups indicates that the molecule may interact with enzymes involved in metabolic processes, leading to disruptions in normal function.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a phosphate group (-PO4-) or a phosphonate group (-CH2-PO3-) in its structure, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. These functional groups are commonly found in molecules such as ATP and ADP, which play important roles in energy transfer within cells. Disruption of their functions by exposure to certain chemicals containing these groups could lead to metabolic disturbances.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to four other atoms, including at least one oxygen atom, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This type of molecular structure is characteristic of many alkaloids, which are known for their toxic effects on biological systems. Exposure to alkaloids could disrupt normal metabolic pathways and lead to various health problems.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of Gd+3 in the molecular structure indicates that it may have some adverse effects on human health due to its paramagnetic nature which can interfere with normal biological processes such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Therefore, molecules containing gadolinium should be used cautiously or avoided altogether if possible.
Rule 2: The presence of CC1=CC=CC=C1O[C@H](CCNC)C2=CC=CC=C2.Cl in the molecular structure suggests that it contains a benzene ring which has been linked to various health hazards including cancer and reproductive problems. Therefore, this type of chemical structure should be avoided in drug development.
Rule 3: The absence of CNCC(C1=CC(=C(C=C1)O)O)O in the molecular structure suggests that it does not contain any harmful chemicals like cyanides which can be toxic at high concentrations. However, further analysis and testing would be necessary to determine the exact safety profile of this particular compound.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This rule applies to molecules in rows 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.

Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This rule applies to molecules in row 1 only.
Note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the given dataset and should be used as a

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or nitro group (-NO2) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on human health. This rule can be applied to the second SMILES string where there is a sulfonyl group present which could potentially lead to toxicity issues if the compound were to interact with biological systems.
Rule 2: A compound containing a benzene ring structure may have a higher likelihood of exhibiting adverse effects compared to compounds without this structural feature. This rule can be applied to the third and fifth SMILES strings where both contain a benzene ring.
Rule 3: Compounds with a high degree of lipophilicity may have a greater tendency to cross cell membranes and enter into cells, leading to potential toxic effects. This rule can be applied to the sixth SMILES string where there is a long carbon chain present which increases the compound's hydrophobicity and potential for cellular uptake.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a carbonyl group (COR) in its structure, it may have metabolic and nutritional disorder side effects. The presence of these functional groups indicates that the compound could be metabolized by enzymes in the body, leading to potential toxicity.
Rule 2: If a compound has a long carbon chain with multiple double bonds, it may also have metabolic and nutritional disorder side effects. This type of compound may interfere with normal lipid metabolism, leading to abnormal levels of fats in the blood.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a heterocyclic ring in its structure, it may not necessarily lead to any adverse effects. However, if this heterocycle is part of a larger conjugated system, it may contribute to the overall reactivity and toxicity of the compound. Therefore, it is important to consider both the size and electronic properties of the heterocycle when predicting its potential side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a carbonyl group (C=O) in its structure, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and are labeled as having adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sodium ion (Na+) or a chloride ion (Cl-) in its structure, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains both ions and is labeled as having adverse effects.

This rule applies to the fourth through seventh molecules in the dataset, which all contain nitrogen atoms and are labeled as having adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a sulfonamide group in the first SMILES string suggests that this molecule could be associated with metabolic and nutritional disorders due to its ability to inhibit carbonic anhydrase enzyme which plays a crucial role in regulating acid-base balance in the body. Similarly, the presence of a nitro group in the fifth SMILES string indicates that this molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects such as methemoglobinemia or hemolytic anemia by oxidizing hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells.
Rule 2: The molecular structure and geometry play a significant role in determining the biological activity of a molecule. For instance, the second SMILES string contains a cyclopropyl ring which is known for its high reactivity and toxicity. Therefore, the presence of this ring in the molecule increases its chances of causing adverse effects on the human body.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule also affect its biological activity. Longer and more complex molecules tend to have lower bioavailability and higher toxicity compared to shorter and simpler ones. This is evident from the last two SMILES strings where the molecules contain multiple rings and functional groups resulting in increased steric hindrance and reduced solubility.

This rule applies to the last four molecules in the dataset, all of which have labels of 1, indicating that they do have potential side effects.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any functional group such as aldehyde or ketone in the structure of the molecule, then it may have potential side effects on human health. The presence of these groups can increase the reactivity of the compound and make it more susceptible to metabolic changes within the body. Therefore, molecules containing aldehydes or ketones should be avoided if possible.
Example: C1C(C(OC1N2C=C(C(=O)NC2=O)I)CO)O 0
Rule 2: If the molecular formula contains nitrogen atoms, especially in the form of amines or amides, they may contribute to the toxicity of the substance. These compounds can interfere with normal cellular processes and lead to adverse reactions.
Example: CC(C)CC1CN2CCC3=CC(=C(C=C3C2CC1=O)OC)OC 1
Rule 3: If the molecule has a long carbon chain or multiple rings, it may have difficulty crossing cell membranes and entering target cells. This can reduce its effectiveness and increase the risk of adverse effects.
Example: CCC1C(C(C(C(=O)C(CC(C(C(C(C(C(=O)O1)C)OC2CC(C(C(O2)C)O)(C)OC)C)OC3C(C(CC(O3)C)N(C)C)OC(=O)CCC(=O)OCC)(C)O)C)C)O)(C)O 1

Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it is unlikely to have adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. Nitro groups are commonly found in drugs and are known for their ability to modify biological activities. However, they can also be toxic at high concentrations and may cause adverse effects such as methemoglobinemia or liver damage. This rule applies to the third SMILES string in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it is likely to have adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. Sulfonyl groups are commonly found in antidiabetic drugs such as glipizide and glyburide and are known to increase insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells. However, they can also cause hypoglycemia and other adverse effects such as weight gain and edema. This rule applies to the last four SMILES strings in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and carboxylic acid in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on metabolism and nutrition disorders.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to interact with biological systems and disrupt normal metabolic processes. For example, sulfonyl groups can bind to receptors on cell membranes and alter their function, while carbonyl and carboxylic acid groups can form hydrogen bonds with amino acids in proteins and affect their structure and function. Therefore, compounds containing these functional groups should be carefully evaluated for their potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also exhibit toxicity due to their ability to react with other molecules through electron transfer reactions.
Explanation: Aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds are highly reactive and can form stable radicals upon interaction with other molecules. This reactivity can lead to cellular damage and disruption of normal physiological functions. Therefore, compounds containing these structural features should also be evaluated for their potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of charged ions such as ammonium, phosphonium, and gold may enhance the toxic potential of a compound by increasing its affinity for biological targets.
Explanation: Charged ions can interact strongly with polar residues on protein surfaces and modify their structure and function. Additionally, some metal ions such as gold can form covalent bonds with biomolecules and interfere with their normal biochemical activities. Therefore, compounds containing charged ions should be evaluated cautiously for their potential to cause adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) or amide group (CONH) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on metabolism and nutrition disorders. This rule can be applied to compounds #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25, #26, #27, #28, #29, #30, #31, #32, #33, #34, #35, #36, #37, #38, #39, #40, #41, #42, #43, #44, #45, #46, #47, #48, #49, #50, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #57, #58, #59, #60, #61, #62, #63, #64, #65, #66, #

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels of 1, indicating that they do have this potential.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to a nitrogen atom, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This is because carboxylic acids are known to be acidic and can interfere with metabolic processes. The third molecule in the dataset contains such a group and it has a label of 1, indicating that it does indeed have this potential.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This is because many drugs and other chemicals that affect metabolism and nutrition contain aromatic rings. The last four molecules in the dataset all contain benzene rings and their labels range from 0 to 1, indicating that there is some uncertainty about how likely they are to cause adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group called "fluorine" in its structure, then it is likely to have side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a functional group called "carbonyl" or "carboxyl" in its structure, then it is unlikely to have side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 0 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a functional group called "isocyanate" in its structure, then it is likely to have side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. However, this rule only applies to one molecule in the dataset, which is labeled as 1.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the dataset and may not apply to all types of molecules. It's always best to consult with experts in the field for accurate predictions.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as nitro group (-NO2) or halogen atoms like chlorine (Cl) in a compound increases its potential for causing adverse effects on metabolism and nutrition disorders. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, the first molecule contains two Cl atoms and one NO2 group, which may contribute to its metabolic toxicity.
Rule 2: A compound containing conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings has a higher likelihood of exhibiting adverse effects compared to those without these structural features. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as either 1 or 0 in the given dataset. For instance, the second molecule contains three conjugated double bonds and one aromatic ring, which may increase its potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 3: The absence of certain chemical moieties in a compound reduces its ability to cause adverse effects. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 0 in the given dataset. For example, the fourth molecule does not contain any nitrogen-containing functional groups, which may explain why it does not exhibit any significant metabolic toxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and 25 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom bonded to carbon, then it may have side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This rule applies to molecules 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, then it may have side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This rule applies to molecules 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and 25 in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide, amide, and amine in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on metabolic processes if they interact with enzymes or receptors involved in these processes. Therefore, compounds containing these functional groups should be labeled as having a higher risk of causing adverse effects than those without them.
Rule 2: Compounds with a high degree of lipophilicity tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues like the liver and brain, which can lead to toxicity and adverse effects. Therefore, compounds with a high logP value (a measure of hydrophobicity) should be labeled as having a higher risk of causing adverse effects than those with lower values.
Rule 3: Compounds with a molecular weight greater than 500 Daltons have a higher likelihood of being toxic due to their ability to cross cell membranes more easily and interfere with cellular functions. Therefore, compounds with a molecular weight above 500 Daltons should be labeled as having a higher risk of causing adverse effects than those below this threshold.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) or carboxylic acid group (COOH) in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on metabolism and nutrition disorders. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1=CC(=C(C=C1N)C(=O)O)O, COCCOC(=O)NCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)NCCCCCCCOP(=O)(C)O)NC(=O)OCCOC, CC(=O)NCCC1=CNC2=C1C=C(C=C2)OC, CN(C)CCCOC1=NN(C2=CC=CC=C21)CC3=CC=CC=C3, CCC(C)C1C(=O)NC(C(=O)NC(C(=O)NC(CSSCC(C(=O)NC(C(=O)N1)CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)N)C(=O)N3CCCC3C(=O)NC(CC(C)C)C(=O)NCC(=O)N)CC(=O)N)CCC(=O)N, and CCN(C)CCCN1C2=CC=CC=C2CCC3=C1C=C(C=C3)Cl.
Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic rings may also have higher chances of causing adverse effects due to their stability and ability to interact with biological systems. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings COC1=C(C=C(C=C1)CNC2=NC(=NC=C2C(=O)NCC3=NC=CC=N3)N4CCC[C@H]4CO, C1CC(CCC1OP(=O)([O-])OC[C@@H](CN(CCN(CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) or carboxylic acid group (COOH) in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on metabolism and nutrition disorders. This is because these functional groups can interact with enzymes involved in metabolic processes, leading to disruptions in normal functioning.
Rule 2: A molecule containing multiple rings or aromatic structures may also have higher chances of causing adverse effects due to their stability and ability to bind strongly to biological molecules. These structures can interfere with normal cellular functions and lead to toxicity.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure may also play a role in determining its potential for causing adverse effects. Longer chains of carbon atoms and more complex branching patterns may make it harder for the body to break down and eliminate the molecule, increasing its likelihood of accumulating and causing harm.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and nitro groups in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on metabolism and nutrition disorders.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to negative health outcomes. For example, the sulfonyl group present in the first SMILES string contains a strong electron-withdrawing substituent that can bind to enzymes involved in glucose metabolism, resulting in hypoglycemia or low blood sugar levels.
Rule 2: A molecule containing aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds may also exhibit toxicity due to its ability to form stable radicals and react with other cellular components.
Explanation: Conjugated systems allow electrons to move freely through the ring structure, making them more reactive and potentially harmful. The second SMILES string contains a benzofuran ring, which has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities but can also act as a mutagen and carcinogen at high doses.
Rule 3: Molecules with electronegative atoms such as nitrogen, chlorine, and fluorine may also pose a risk of metabolic disruption if they contain functional groups that can interfere with enzyme function or alter hormone signaling pathways.
Explanation: The third SMILES string contains a trifluoromethyl group, which is highly electronegative and can affect the electronic distribution within the molecule. This can lead to changes in protein binding affinity and disrupt normal physiological processes. Additionally, the fourth SMILES string contains a nitro group, which can be reduced by cytochrome P450 enzymes to form reactive intermediates that can damage DNA and proteins.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as C=C or CC, then it may have side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the dataset. For example, the first molecule in the dataset contains two C=C bonds and is labeled as 1. The second molecule also contains a C=C bond but is labeled as 0 because its structure does not appear to be related to metabolism and nutrition disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as Cl or F, then it may have side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as either 1 or 0 in the dataset. For example, the fifth molecule in the dataset contains one chlorine atom and is labeled as 1. However, the sixth molecule also contains a chlorine atom but is labeled as 0 because its structure does not appear to be related to metabolism and nutrition disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have side effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as either 1 or 0 in the dataset. For example, the eleventh molecule in the dataset contains a nitro group and is labeled as 1. However, the twelfth molecule also contains a nitro group but is labeled as 0 because

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. Examples include CC(C)(C)NCC(COC1=NSN=C1N2CCOCC2)O, C1=CC=C2C(=C1)C=NN=C2NN, and COC(=O)[C@@H]1[C@H]2CCC(N2CCCF)C[C@@H]1C3=CC=C(C=C3)I.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sodium ion (Na+) or a chloride ion (Cl-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. Example includes CC(C1=CC2=C(C=C1)C=C(C=C2)OC)C(=O)[O-].[Na+].
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. The first example in the dataset contains both these groups and is labeled as having such potential.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as bromine or chlorine) attached to a benzene ring, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. The second and third examples in the dataset contain this structural feature and are labeled as having such potential.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) adjacent to a double bond, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This structural feature appears in several examples in the dataset, including the fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth molecules. However, note that this rule is less specific than Rules 1 and 2, and other factors may also contribute to the potential for adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This rule applies to molecules 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 in the dataset.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. The presence of these functional groups in a molecule can affect its ability to bind to receptors involved in metabolic processes, leading to disruptions in normal function.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to four other atoms, including two carbon atoms, one oxygen atom, and either hydrogen or another nitrogen atom, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This type of structure is commonly found in molecules such as nitroglycerin and cocaine, which have been known to disrupt metabolic processes and cause adverse health effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom bonded to a sulfur atom, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. Fluorine is a highly electronegative element that can alter the chemical properties of nearby atoms, potentially affecting their interactions with biological systems. However, this rule should be considered tentative until further research is conducted to determine the specific impact of fluorinated compounds on human health.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a nitrile group (-CN) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have metabolic and nutritional disorder side effects. The first SMILES string in the given data has both these groups present which matches this rule.
Rule 2: If a compound contains bromine atoms on an aromatic ring, then it may not have any adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. The second SMILES string in the given data has two bromine atoms on an aromatic ring which matches this rule.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a conjugated system of double bonds between an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have metabolic and nutritional disorder side effects. The third and fourth SMILES strings in the given data match this rule as they contain such systems.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects if they interfere with normal metabolic processes or disrupt cellular functions. For example, the carbonyl group (C=O) present in molecules such as aldehydes and ketones can react with proteins and nucleic acids, leading to toxicity. Similarly, the nitro group (-NO2) found in many drugs can trigger oxidative stress and inflammation, leading to tissue damage. Therefore, molecules containing these functional groups should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxic effects.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule can also affect its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with target receptors. Molecules with larger sizes and complex structures may have lower bioavailability and higher clearance rates, reducing their efficacy and increasing the risk of adverse reactions. On the other hand, smaller molecules with simpler structures may be more likely to penetrate cells and elicit biological responses. Therefore, molecular weight and lipophilicity should be considered when predicting the safety profile of a compound.
Rule 3: The chemical composition of a molecule can influence its stability and reactivity under physiological conditions. Compounds containing metals or reactive functional groups such as epoxides, azides, and isothiocyanates may be unstable and prone to degradation or inactivation. Therefore, compounds containing these moieties should be handled with caution and tested thoroughly before being administered to patients.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects. For example, molecules containing carbonyl groups such as aldehydes or ketones have been shown to be toxic and can cause adverse health effects. Similarly, molecules containing nitro groups can also be harmful if ingested or inhaled. Therefore, identifying these functional groups in a molecule could help predict its potential toxicity.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule can also affect its ability to interact with biological systems and potentially cause adverse effects. Molecules that are too large or have a complex structure may be difficult to metabolize and eliminate from the body, leading to accumulation and potential toxicity. On the other hand, smaller molecules with simpler structures may be more easily metabolized and excreted, reducing their likelihood of causing harm.
Rule 3: The chemical composition of a molecule can also play a role in determining its potential for causing adverse effects. For instance, some elements such as selenium and mercury have known toxic properties and can cause serious health problems when present in high levels. Additionally, certain types of bonds such as carbon-carbon double bonds or sulfur-sulfur double bonds can make molecules more reactive and potentially toxic.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders:
1. If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and are labeled as having adverse effects.
2. If the molecule contains fluorine atoms, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains fluorine atoms and is labeled as having adverse effects.
3. If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to metabolism and nutrition disorders. This rule is based on the observation that many toxic compounds contain extended systems of conjugated double bonds. However, this rule should be applied cautiously because some non-toxic compounds also contain such systems. For example, the last four molecules in the dataset all contain conjugated systems but only one of them is labeled as having adverse effects.
