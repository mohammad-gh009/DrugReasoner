Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a negatively charged oxygen atom bonded to two carbon atoms (i.e., a carboxylate group), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. This rule applies to the first SMILES string in the dataset, which contains the formula for ammonium formate. Ammonium formate is commonly used as a food additive but can also be toxic at high doses.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds between carbon atoms, including one carbonyl group, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. This rule applies to the second SMILES string in the dataset, which represents a fatty acid. Fatty acids are important components of cell membranes and can also act as signaling molecules. However, certain types of fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, can be metabolized into inflammatory mediators that contribute to tissue damage during inflammation.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a heterocyclic ring structure containing nitrogen atoms, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. This rule applies to the third SMILES string in the dataset, which represents a porphyrin derivative. Porphyrins are pigments found in hemoglobin and other proteins that play important roles in oxygen transport and storage. However, some porph

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. The presence of this functional group is known to have antimicrobial properties, but it can also interfere with the body's normal functioning of carbonic anhydrase enzymes, which can lead to side effects such as headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should be carefully evaluated for their potential risks before being used in medical applications.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. Nitro groups are commonly found in explosives and can cause tissue damage when exposed to high temperatures or pressures. They can also react with other chemicals in the body to form toxic compounds that can cause serious health problems. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should be avoided whenever possible unless they are necessary for the intended use.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) attached to a benzene ring, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. Halogenated benzenes are commonly used as solvents, pesticides, and flame retardants, but they can also act as endocrine disruptors and carcinogens. Therefore,

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as "-NO2" or "-COOH", then it has high probability of causing adverse effects in humans. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1=CC(=CN=C1)CC(O)(P(=O)(O)O)P(=O)(O)O, CC(CC1=CC=CC=C1)NC, CCC12CCC3C(C1CCC2(C#C)O)CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34, Cl[Tl], CNCC(C1=CC(=C(C=C1)O)O)O, COC1=CC=CC2=CC=CC=C21, CCS, CCNCC(COC1=CC=CC2=CC=CC=C21)O, CNC(=O)C1CCCN1C(=O)C(CCCN=C(N)N)NC(=O)C(CC(C)C)NC(=O)C(COC(C)(C)C)NC(=O)C(CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)NC(=O)C(CO)NC(=O)C(CC3=CNC4=CC=CC=C43)NC(=O)C(CC5=CN=CN5)NC(=O)C6CCC(=O)N6, B1(C2=C(CO1)C=C(C=C

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure CN(C)C/C=C/C(=O)NC1=C(C=C2C(=C1)C(=NC=N2)NC3=CC(=C(C=C3)F)Cl)O[C@@H]4CCOC4, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. This rule is based on the fact that this particular substructure is present in one of the molecules labeled as having such potential. However, it's important to note that this rule should only be used as a starting point for further analysis and experimentation, and not as a definitive predictor of adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure CC1=C(C(=CC=C1)Cl)NC(=O)C2=CN=C(S2)NC3=NC(=NC(=C3)N4CCN(CC4)CCO)C, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. This rule is based on the fact that this particular substructure is also present in one of the molecules labeled as having such potential. Again, however, this rule should only be used as a starting point for further analysis and experimentation, and not as a definitive

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects if they interact with biological systems in ways that disrupt normal function or lead to toxicity. For example, the carbonyl group (C=O) present in the first SMILES string could be responsible for potential toxic effects due to its ability to react with other molecules through covalent bonding.
Rule 2: The structure of a molecule can also play a role in determining its potential for adverse effects. For instance, the second SMILES string contains several amide bonds which have been associated with toxicity due to their ability to form stable complexes with metal ions such as iron. Additionally, the presence of multiple double bonds in the chain may contribute to reactivity and susceptibility to oxidation.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound can also influence its potential for adverse effects. Large molecules with high lipophilicity tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues such as the brain and liver, leading to potential toxicity. This is exemplified by the third SMILES string, which contains two chlorine atoms and has a relatively large molecular weight compared to the others.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (represented by the SMILES notation "C=O"), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (represented by the SMILES notation "X" where X is any halogen element), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. This rule applies to molecules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (represented by the SMILES notation "SO2NH"), then it may have the potential

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group such as sulfonamide or nitro group in a compound, then it may have potential for causing adverse effects. The given SMILES strings do not contain any sulfonamide or nitro groups but they do contain other functional groups like carboxylic acid, ester, amide etc. which are known to be non-toxic. Therefore, these compounds cannot be predicted to cause any adverse effects based on this rule alone.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a heterocyclic ring system, especially if it has nitrogen atoms present within its structure, then it may have potential for causing adverse effects due to their reactivity towards biological systems. However, none of the given SMILES strings contain any heterocyclic rings except for one which contains a pyridine ring. This particular compound does not have any reported adverse effects so far. Hence, this rule also cannot be used to make predictions about the toxicity of these compounds.
Rule 3: If a compound contains multiple aromatic rings connected together through conjugated double bonds, then it may have potential for causing adverse effects due to their ability to interact with biological molecules. One of the given SMILES strings contains two benzene rings connected by a single bond, while another contains three fused benzene rings. These structures suggest that both compounds could potentially exhibit toxic effects. However, further analysis and experimentation would be required to confirm their toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of halogen atoms such as chlorine or bromine in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects due to their ability to disrupt biological systems through covalent bonding interactions. Therefore, compounds containing these elements should be labeled as having potential for toxicity.
Rule 2: Compounds containing functional groups such as sulfonyl groups (-SO2R) or nitro groups (-NO2) have been associated with increased risk of adverse effects due to their ability to interfere with normal metabolic processes. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should also be labeled as potentially toxic.
Rule 3: Compounds containing aromatic rings may also increase the likelihood of adverse effects due to their ability to interact with biological molecules through π-π stacking interactions. However, this rule is less specific than Rules 1 and 2, and additional information would be needed to make a more definitive prediction about the toxicity of any given compound.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of halogen atoms such as chlorine or bromine in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects due to their ability to disrupt biological systems through covalent bonding interactions. Therefore, compounds containing these elements should be labeled as having potential for toxicity.
Rule 2: Compounds containing functional groups such as sulfonyl groups (-SO2R) or nitro groups (-NO2) have been associated with increased risk of adverse effects due to their ability to interfere with normal metabolic processes. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should also be labeled as potentially toxic.
Rule 3: Compounds containing aromatic rings may also increase the likelihood of adverse effects due to their ability to interact with biological molecules through π-π stacking interactions. However, this rule is less specific than Rules 1 and 2, and additional information would be needed to make a more definitive prediction about the toxicity of any given compound.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects if they interact with biological systems in ways that disrupt normal function or lead to toxicity. For example, the nitro group (-NO2) in the first SMILES string could be responsible for potential toxicity due to its ability to form reactive oxygen species upon reduction by enzymes such as cytochrome P450. Similarly, the sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in the second SMILES string has been associated with idiosyncratic drug reactions due to its ability to bind to proteins and form haptens. Therefore, molecules containing these or similar functional groups should be evaluated carefully for their potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound can also influence its ability to cross cell membranes and reach target sites within cells. Molecules with high molecular weights and hydrophobicities tend to have lower aqueous solubilities and higher membrane permeabilities than those with low values for these parameters. This can make them more likely to accumulate in tissues and cause adverse effects, particularly when administered at high doses or over long periods of time. Therefore, compounds with high molecular weights and lipophilicities should be considered potentially hazardous until proven otherwise.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule can play a significant role in determining its biological activity and potential toxicity. For example, the third SMILES string contains a chiral center and a double bond that can exist in either cis or trans configuration depending on the orientation of the substituents around each atom. The trans isomer is known to be less active against certain enzymes than the cis isomer, which could affect its therapeutic efficacy and safety profile. Therefore, it

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as CC(C)C(=O)OC1=C(C=C(C=C1)CO)[C@H](CCN(C(C)C)C(C)C)C2=CC=CC=C2, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. This rule is based on the fact that this particular functional group is commonly found in molecules that have been associated with these types of adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a functional group such as CN1CCN(CC1)C(C2=CC=CC=C2)C3=CC=CC=C3, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. This rule is based on the fact that this particular functional group is also commonly found in molecules that have been associated with these types of adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a functional group such as C1CN2C(=CC=C2C(=O)C3=CC=CC=C3)C1C(=O)O, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. This rule is

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl group (-SO2R) or nitro group (-NO2) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on human health. Therefore, compounds containing these functional groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles before being used in drug development.
Rule 2: Compounds with aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also have higher chances of exhibiting toxicity due to their ability to interact with biological molecules through π-π stacking interactions or electron transfer reactions. Therefore, careful consideration should be given when designing drugs containing these structural features.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a compound's structure may also play a role in determining its toxicity profile. Generally, smaller and simpler structures tend to be less toxic than larger and more complex ones. However, this rule should be applied cautiously since exceptions exist. For example, some small molecules like acetaminophen can cause severe liver damage at high doses despite having a relatively simple structure.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like "-COOH" or "-CONH2" in the molecular structure, then it has high probability of causing adverse effects due to its ability to bind to proteins and enzymes. The given SMILES strings do not have any such groups present. Therefore, they may not be associated with any adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains aromatic rings, then it also increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects as these rings are known to interact with biological systems. However, this rule alone cannot determine if the compound will cause adverse effects since other factors like dosage, exposure time etc. also play a role. None of the given SMILES strings contain aromatic rings.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains multiple polar functional groups, then it may increase the solubility of the compound which could lead to increased absorption into the body. This could potentially result in higher toxicity levels. One example of such a compound is C16H18ClN7O9S2. It has two sulfonamide groups which make it highly soluble in water leading to potential toxic effects. On the other hand, compounds without polar functional groups tend to have lower solubility and therefore less likely to cause adverse effects even at higher doses.

================================



================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (represented by the SMILES notation "C=O"), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (represented by the SMILES notation "X" where X is any halogen element), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. This rule applies to molecules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (represented by the SMILES notation "SO2NH"), then it may have the potential

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as "CCCC(=O)O" or "CC(C1=CC(=C(C=C1)C2=CC=CC=C2)F)C(=O)O", then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. These functional groups are commonly found in molecules that are known to cause irritation or inflammation.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a functional group such as "CCCCN1C[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H]1CO)O)O)O" or "CN1C=NC2=C1C(=O)N(C(=O)N2C)C", then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. These functional groups are commonly found in molecules that are known to cause allergic reactions or other immune system responses.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a functional group such as "CC12CCC(=O)C=C1CCC3C2C(CC4(C3CCC4(C(=O)CO)O)C)O" or "CC1C(C(CC(O1)OC2C(C(C(OC2OC3=C4C=C5C=C3

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as "-NO2" or "-COOH", then it has high probability of causing adverse effects in humans. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1=CC(=CN=C1)CC(O)(P(=O)(O)O)P(=O)(O)O, CC(CC1=CC=CC=C1)NC, CCC12CCC3C(C1CCC2(C#C)O)CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34, Cl[Tl], CNCC(C1=CC(=C(C=C1)O)O)O, COC1=CC=CC2=CC=CC=C21, CCS, CCNCC(COC1=CC=CC2=CC=CC=C21)O, CNC(=O)C1CCCN1C(=O)C(CCCN=C(N)N)NC(=O)C(CC(C)C)NC(=O)C(COC(C)(C)C)NC(=O)C(CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)NC(=O)C(CO)NC(=O)C(CC3=CNC4=CC=CC=C43)NC(=O)C(CC5=CN=CN5)NC(=O)C6CCC(=O)N6, B1(C2=C(CO1)C=C(C=C

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide, nitro, amide, and halogenated compounds in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the human body.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to disrupt normal biological processes by interacting with enzymes or proteins involved in cellular metabolism. They can also alter the structure and function of cells, leading to toxic effects. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles before being used in drug development.
Rule 2: A compound's molecular weight and hydrophobicity may affect its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with target receptors within the body. Molecules with high molecular weights and hydrophobicities tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues like the brain and liver, which can lead to toxicity. Therefore, drugs with low molecular weights and hydrophilic functionalities may be more favorable candidates for therapeutic use.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a compound can significantly impact its bioactivity and pharmacokinetic profile. For example, enantiomers of chiral drugs often exhibit different pharmacological activities due to differences in their three-dimensional structures. Additionally, changes in conformation caused by isomerization or cyclization reactions can affect a compound's stability and metabolic fate. Therefore, careful consideration must be given to the stereochemical aspects of new drug candidates during preclinical testing.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a nitro group (NO2), then it may have side effects related to injury, poisoning, and procedural complications. The presence of these groups in a compound increases its reactivity and toxicity, which can lead to adverse reactions.
Example: CC1=CS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(cc2)n1 1
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a heterocyclic ring system such as pyridine or pyrimidine, then it may also have side effects related to injury, poisoning, and procedural complications. These rings are known for their biological activities and can interact with various biomolecules, leading to toxic effects.
Example: C1=Nc2nc(NS(=O)(=O)c3ccccc3cn2C)n(C)c1 1
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a halogen atom such as fluorine or chlorine, then it may be less likely to have side effects related to injury, poisoning, and procedural complications. Halogen atoms are often used in drug design to increase lipophilicity and improve pharmacokinetic properties. However, they do not necessarily reduce toxicity.
Example: CCC(=C)C(=O)C1=C(C(=C(C=C1)OCC(=O)O)Cl)Cl 1

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide, nitro, amide, and halogenated compounds in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the human body.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to disrupt normal biological processes by interacting with enzymes or proteins involved in cellular metabolism. They can also alter the structure and function of cells, leading to toxic effects. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles before being used in drug development.
Rule 2: A compound's molecular weight and hydrophobicity may affect its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with target receptors within the body. Molecules with high molecular weights and hydrophobicities tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues like the brain and liver, which can lead to toxicity. Therefore, drugs with low molecular weights and hydrophilic functionalities may be more favorable candidates for therapeutic use.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a compound can significantly impact its bioactivity and pharmacokinetic profile. For example, enantiomers of chiral drugs often exhibit different pharmacological activities due to differences in their three-dimensional structures. Additionally, changes in conformation caused by isomerization or cyclization reactions can affect a compound's stability and metabolic fate. Therefore, careful consideration must be given to the stereochemical aspects of new drug candidates during preclinical testing.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular formula contains iodine or calcium ions, then it has no relation to causing adverse effects in injuries, poisonings, and procedural complications.
Explanation: Iodine and calcium ions do not have any direct impact on biological systems and cannot be linked to specific chemical reactions involved in these conditions. Therefore, molecules containing them should not be considered as potential causes of adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it may have some relation to causing adverse effects in injuries, poisonings, and procedural complications.
Explanation: Sulfonyl groups are known for their ability to bind to proteins and affect their function. They can also react with other functional groups such as amines and alcohols, which could potentially lead to unwanted interactions within a cell. However, this rule should be used with caution since there may be many other factors that contribute to the overall toxicity of a compound.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have some relation to causing adverse effects in injuries, poisonings, and procedural complications.
Explanation: Nitro groups are known for their ability to interact with biological systems and affect various biochemical processes. They can act as electron-withdrawing groups, change the acidity of neighboring protons, and form covalent bonds with other atoms. These properties make nitro compounds potentially toxic and suggest they may play a role in causing adverse effects in certain situations.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of chlorine atoms in the structure of a molecule, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects related to injury, poisoning, or procedural complications. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "CCCl" as seen in the first example provided.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects such as skin irritation or respiratory problems. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings containing the symbol for nitrogen in its oxidized state (N+) as seen in the third example provided.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfhydryl group (-SH), then it may have the ability to cross-link proteins and cause tissue damage. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings containing the symbol for sulfur in its reduced state (S-) as seen in the fourth example provided.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having the potential for such adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. However, this rule should be applied cautiously since some molecules containing nitro groups are known to be safe and even beneficial. For example, the second molecule in the dataset does not contain a nitro group but has been labeled as potentially causing adverse effects due to its similarity to other molecules in the dataset that do contain nitro groups.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. This rule is based on the observation that several molecules in the dataset that have been labeled as potentially causing adverse effects contain halogen atoms, including chlorine. However, again, this rule should be applied cautiously since there are many molecules containing halogens that are known to be safe and even beneficial.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as -COOH or -CHO, then it may have side effects related to injury, poisoning, and procedural complications. The presence of these groups indicates that the compound could be toxic or irritating to the body.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure has multiple rings or conjugated double bonds, then it may also have similar side effects due to its high reactivity and ability to interact with other molecules in the body. These types of structures often indicate that the compound is potentially harmful.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains nitrogen atoms, especially in the form of amines or amides, then it may also have side effects related to injury, poisoning, and procedural complications. Nitrogen-containing compounds can be toxic and irritating to the body, and they may interfere with normal cellular processes.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (represented by the SMILES notation "C=O"), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (represented by the SMILES notation "X" where X is any halogen element), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. This rule applies to molecules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (represented by the SMILES notation "SO2NH"), then it may have the potential

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular formula contains platinum, then it has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. This rule applies only to the first SMILE string provided.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains chlorine atoms, then it may have the ability to cause adverse effects due to its reactivity. This rule applies only to the second SMILE string provided.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group, then it may be able to cause adverse effects by disrupting normal cellular processes. This rule applies only to the fifth SMILE string provided.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. The presence of this functional group is known to have antimicrobial properties, but it can also interfere with the body's normal functioning of carbonic anhydrase enzymes, which can lead to side effects such as headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should be carefully evaluated for their potential risks before being used in medical applications.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. Nitro groups are commonly found in explosives and can cause tissue damage when exposed to high temperatures or pressures. They can also react with other chemicals in the body to form toxic compounds that can cause serious health problems. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should be avoided whenever possible unless they are necessary for the intended use.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) attached to a benzene ring, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. Halogenated benzenes are commonly used as solvents, pesticides, and flame retardants, but they can also act as endocrine disruptors and carcinogens. Therefore,

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a cyano group (-CN) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in relation to injuries, poisonings, and procedural complications. The presence of these functional groups may increase the reactivity of the molecule and lead to toxic reactions.
Example: C1=CN(C(=O)N=C1N)C2C(C(C(O2)CO)O)(F)F 1
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-CH=CH-), then it has a low probability of causing adverse effects in relation to injuries, poisonings, and procedural complications. Conjugation between these two functional groups may increase the stability of the molecule and reduce its reactivity.
Example: CC1=CC=CC=C1C(C2=CC=CC=C2)OCCN(C)C 0
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a metal ion such as sodium (Na+) or iron (Fe+3), then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in relation to injuries, poisonings, and procedural complications. These ions may increase the reactivity of the molecule and lead to toxic reactions.
Example: F 1
C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. The first example in the dataset contains a sulfonyl group and has been labeled as having the potential to cause such effects.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a nitro group (NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. The second example in the dataset contains a nitro group and has been labeled as having the potential to cause such effects.
Rule 3: If a compound contains both a sulfonyl group and a nitro group, it may have even greater potential to cause adverse effects related to injuries, poisonings, or procedural complications. This rule is based on the fact that these two functional groups are often associated with toxic compounds. The third example in the dataset contains both a sulfonyl group and a nitro group and has been labeled as having high potential to cause such effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as "CC(=O)O" or "CCONP(=O)(Oc)c1ccc(cc1)n1nnnc1" in its SMILES representation, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to injury, poisoning, and procedural complications.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine ("Cl") or fluorine ("F") in its SMILES representation along with a nitro group ("-NO2") attached to a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects by inhibiting enzymes involved in metabolism.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group ("SO2R") in its SMILES representation, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and affect brain function.
