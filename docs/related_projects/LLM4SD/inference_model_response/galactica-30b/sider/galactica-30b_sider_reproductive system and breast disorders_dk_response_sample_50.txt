Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects on the reproductive system or breast tissue. For example, the presence of chlorine atoms in the first SMILES string suggests that this molecule could have endocrine disrupting properties. Similarly, the presence of nitro groups in the fifth SMILES string indicates that this molecule could be toxic to the reproductive system.
Rule 2: The structure of a molecule can also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects. For instance, the second SMILES string contains a sulfonamide group which is known to be toxic to the reproductive system. Additionally, the third SMILES string contains a nitrile group which is highly reactive and could potentially interact with other molecules in the body.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule can also affect its toxicity. Longer and more complex molecules tend to have higher chances of interacting with other molecules in the body and causing adverse effects. This is evident from the sixth SMILES string which has a long carbon chain and several rings.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of any functional group such as aldehyde or ketone in the structure of the molecule, then it may lead to adverse effects on the human body. The given SMILES strings do not have any such groups present.
Rule 2: If the molecular weight of the compound is high, then it may also lead to adverse effects due to its ability to penetrate cell membranes easily. However, this rule cannot be applied solely based on the provided SMILES strings since they do not provide information about the molecular weights of the compounds.
Rule 3: If the compound contains any toxicophore groups, such as nitro groups, halogens, or aromatic rings, then it may lead to adverse effects on the human body. Again, none of the given SMILES strings contain any such groups.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure "CC1(C(N2C(S1)C(C2=O)NC(=O)C(C3=CC=CC=C3)C(=O)[O-])C(=O)[O-])C" or "CC1(OC2CC3C4CC(C5=CC(=O)C=CC5(C4(C(CC3(C2(O1)C(=O)CO)C)O)F)C)F)C" then it may have potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders. These substructures contain the thiadiazole ring which is known for its biological activities including anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and anticancer properties. However, further research is needed to confirm their association with reproductive system and breast disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure "CC1CC2=C(CCC(=O)C2)C3C1C4CCC(C4(CC3)C)(C#C)O" then it may have potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders. This substructure contains the cyclopentenone ring which is known for its biological activities including antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antitumor properties. However

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the reproductive system or breast tissue. For example, the sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) present in the first SMILES string could be responsible for the observed side-effects. Similarly, the presence of multiple aromatic rings in the third SMILES string could also contribute to the adverse effects.
Rule 2: The charge and ionic nature of a molecule can also affect its ability to interact with biological systems and potentially cause adverse effects. For instance, the fourth SMILES string contains two negatively charged oxygen atoms ([O-2]) which could form hydrogen bonds with positively charged amino acid residues in proteins. This interaction could alter the structure and function of the protein leading to adverse effects.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule can play a significant role in determining its biological activity. For example, the fifth SMILES string contains a chiral center (C) which has been resolved into its R and S isomers. Only one isomer (R) is shown here but both enantiomers should be tested for potential adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (represented by the SMILES string Cc1ccccc1) or a naphthalene ring (represented by the SMILES string Cn1ccnc2ccc3nnc(n3)c2c1), then it is likely to have side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented in the dataset by the SMILES strings CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)C2=CC=C(N2C)CC(=O)[O-], CN1C=CNC1=S, and CCC(C)C1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)CC=C.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (represented by the SMILES string CS(=O)(=O)O), then it is unlikely to have side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented in the dataset by the SMILES strings CCS(=O)(=O)ONC1=C(C(=NC=N1)OCCOC2=NC=C(C=N2)Br)C3=CC=C(C=C3)Br and COC1=C2C(=CC(=C1

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a functional group such as "-COOH" or "-OH", it may have potential to cause adverse effects on the human body. This rule applies to compounds in rows 2, 7, and 9 where they contain these groups.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings may also be associated with adverse effects due to their ability to bind to proteins and disrupt normal cellular processes. This rule applies to row 8 where the compound has two phenyl rings.
Rule 3: The presence of certain atoms or bonds within a compound may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects. For example, compounds containing nitrogen-nitrogen double bonds (such as those found in row 3) tend to be highly reactive and may interact with other molecules in ways that lead to toxicity. Similarly, compounds containing sulfur-sulfur single bonds (as seen in row 4) often exhibit unique chemical reactivity and may pose health risks if ingested or inhaled.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the functional group "[Li+].[OH-]" or "[Fe]", then it may have side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. This rule is based on the fact that these functional groups are often associated with hormonal imbalances in the body.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the functional group "CCOC(=O)CC(C(=O)OCC)SP(=S)(OC)OC" or "CCOC(=O)C(CCC1=CC=CC=C1)NC(C)C(=O)N2CC3=CC=CC=C3CC2C(=O)O", then it may not have side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. These functional groups are commonly found in drugs used for treating reproductive health issues such as birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains the functional group "CC1=CC(=NO1)C(=O)NNCC2=CC=CC=C2" or "C(CC(C(F)F)(C(=O)O)N)CN", then it may have side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. These functional groups are often found in pesticides and industrial chemicals that have been linked to reproductive toxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels of 1 indicating their association with such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a conjugated system consisting of alternating double bonds and single bonds, then it may also have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. This rule applies to the third molecule in the dataset which has a label of 1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom like fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, then it may not have any significant side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. None of the last four molecules in the dataset contain halogens and all have labels of 0 indicating no association with such side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a bromine atom attached to a carbon atom in the para position relative to a carbonyl group, then it is likely to have side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the first molecule in the dataset satisfies this condition.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen-nitrogen double bond, then it is unlikely to have side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" in the dataset. For example, the fourth molecule in the dataset does not satisfy this condition.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom bonded to two carbon atoms, one of which is also bonded to a carbonyl group, then it may have side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as either "0" or "1" in the dataset. For example, the sixth molecule in the dataset satisfies this condition but its label is "0" indicating that it does not have any known side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders. However, further research would be needed to confirm this prediction.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a benzene ring (-C6H5), then it may have potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders. The first example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains both -CN and -C6H5 groups.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders. The second example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains -Cl and -C=O groups connected by a single bond.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a guanidine group (-NH-C(=NH)-NH-) or a urea group (-NH-C(=O)-NH-), then it may have potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders. The third example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a guanidine group.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group such as carbonyl group or carboxylic acid in the structure of a molecule, then it may have potential to cause adverse effects on human health. This rule can be applied to the first two molecules listed above where the presence of carbonyl group and carboxylic acid respectively could lead to harmful effects if consumed.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a long chain hydrocarbon without any functional groups, it may not pose any significant harm to human health. However, if it has multiple double bonds or aromatic rings, it may increase its potential for toxicity due to increased reactivity. The third molecule listed above follows this rule since it only consists of a simple alkane chain which does not contain any functional groups.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains nitrogenous bases such as cytosine or thymine, it may interact with DNA or RNA leading to adverse effects like mutations or cancer. The last three molecules listed above follow this rule since they all contain either cytosine or thymine base.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a conjugated π-system, such as in the case of aromatic rings or double bonds, it may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects due to its ability to interact with biological systems. Therefore, molecules containing these structures should be labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 2: Molecules with functional groups like carbonyls, alcohols, and amines may also contribute to their toxicity by interacting with biological macromolecules like proteins and DNA. Therefore, molecules containing these functional groups should also be considered for labeling as potentially harmful.
Rule 3: The presence of certain atoms or fragments in a molecule may indicate a higher risk of adverse effects. For example, compounds containing sulfur or chlorine may have a greater chance of causing harm to the reproductive system and breast tissue. Therefore, molecules containing these elements should be flagged as potentially dangerous.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a benzene ring or any other aromatic ring, it may have potential side effects on the reproductive system and breast tissue. The presence of such rings in a chemical structure increases its lipophilicity which makes it easier for the substance to cross cell membranes and interact with biological systems. Therefore, compounds containing these rings should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxicity towards the reproductive and mammary systems.
Rule 2: Compounds with functional groups like carbonyl, carboxyl, and nitro groups may also exhibit toxic effects on the reproductive and mammary systems. These groups increase the reactivity of the molecules and make them more susceptible to metabolic changes leading to the formation of reactive metabolites. Such metabolites can bind to cellular macromolecules causing damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids. Hence, chemicals possessing these functionalities need careful evaluation before being used as drugs or food additives.
Rule 3: A compound's molecular weight and hydrophobicity play important roles in determining its ability to penetrate cell membranes and exert toxic effects. Generally, smaller molecules with lower log P values tend to be less lipophilic and less likely to accumulate in tissues. On the contrary, larger molecules with higher log P values are more hydrophobic and can easily cross cell membranes, potentially leading to toxic effects. Therefore, it is essential to consider both factors when evaluating the safety of new compounds.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it may have side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a cyano group (-CN) and has been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. However, there is only one molecule in the dataset that contains a nitro group (-NO2) but has not been labeled as having potential side effects. Therefore, this rule cannot be confirmed based on the current dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may have side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. There are two molecules in the dataset that contain a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) and have been labeled as having potential side effects.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, it may have potential side effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders. The first two molecules listed in the table contain these functional groups and they both have labels indicating their association with such side effects.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings like benzene or naphthalene may also be associated with reproductive system and breast disorders if they possess certain chemical functionalities. For example, the third molecule in the table has a benzofuran ring which is known for its estrogenic activity. It should be noted that this rule is not definitive as there could be other factors involved in causing such side effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with a nitro group (-NO2) or a cyano group (-CN) in their structures tend to have high reactivity and may pose safety concerns. The last three molecules in the table all contain one or both of these functional groups and they all have labels indicating their potential toxicity. However, it's important to note that these rules are general guidelines and should not be used as the sole basis for predicting the safety of a particular compound. Further testing and analysis would be necessary before making any conclusions about its safety.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (represented by the SMILES string C1=CC=C(C=C1)) and a carbonyl group (represented by the SMILES string CC(=O)OO), then it may have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. The presence of these functional groups in combination may indicate that the molecule has hormonal activity or interacts with estrogen receptors, which could lead to such adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a metal ion (represented by the SMILES strings [Mg+2] and [Na+]), then it may also have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. Metals like magnesium and sodium play important roles in many biological processes, including hormone regulation and cell signaling. Therefore, their presence in a molecule could potentially disrupt these functions and lead to adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a phosphorus atom bonded to two oxygen atoms (represented by the SMILES string OP(=O)(O)[O-]), then it may not have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. This functional group is commonly found in phospholipids, which are essential components of cell membranes. The absence of this functional group in conjunction with other structural features mentioned in Rule 1 and Rule 2 may increase the likelihood of adverse effects related to reproduction and breast disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sodium ion (Na+) or a manganese ion (Mn+2) in its structure, then it may have potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders. The presence of these ions indicates that the molecule may interact with biological systems in ways that could lead to negative health outcomes.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a phosphate group (PO4−3), then it may also have potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders. Phosphate groups are commonly found in DNA and RNA molecules, which play important roles in cell division and reproduction. Therefore, any disruption to these molecules could potentially have negative impacts on reproductive health.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H6) or a naphthalene ring (C10H8), then it may also have potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders. These rings are common structural features in many hormones and other chemicals that regulate reproductive function. Any interference with these chemical signals could potentially disrupt normal hormonal balance and lead to negative health outcomes.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure "Cc1ccc(cc1Oc2ccccc2Br)n2cnccn2" or its mirror image, then it is likely to have side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders. This rule was derived from the first SMILES string in the dataset which contains this substructure.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure "C(NNCNN)N", then it is unlikely to have side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders. This rule was derived from the second SMILES string in the dataset which does not contain any such substructures.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains the substructure "CC(=O)Nc1nc(C)nn1C", then it is likely to have side effects related to reproductive system and breast disorders. This rule was derived from the third SMILES string in the dataset which contains this substructure.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring or a heterocyclic ring, it may have potential side effects on the reproductive system and breast tissue. The presence of such rings in the chemical structure indicates that the compound has the ability to bind to estrogen receptors, which could lead to hormonal imbalances and potentially harmful effects on these organs. Therefore, molecules containing this structural feature should be labeled as having potential side effects on the reproductive system and breasts.
Example: Label 1 for CC1=C(C=C(C=C1)C(=O)NC2=CC(=C(C=C2)CN3CCN(CC3)C)C(F)(F)F)C#CC4=CN=C5N4N=CC=C5 1
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have potential side effects on the reproductive system and breast tissue. Nitro groups are known to be toxic and can disrupt normal cellular processes. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should also be labeled as having potential side effects on the reproductive system and breasts.
Example: Label 1 for C1=CC(=C(C(=C1)Cl)SC(CCC2=CC=C(C=C2)Cl)CN3C=CN=C3)Cl.[N+](=O)(O)[O-] 1
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), it may have potential side

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects on the reproductive system or breast tissue. For example, the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a molecule may suggest a potential for binding to estrogen receptors and disrupting hormonal balance. Similarly, the presence of a nitro group (NO2) in a molecule may suggest a potential for causing DNA damage and mutations. Therefore, molecules containing these functional groups should be carefully evaluated for their potential to cause adverse effects on the reproductive system or breast tissue.
Rule 2: The molecular structure and size may also play a role in determining the potential for adverse effects. Molecules with larger structures and more complex shapes may have greater difficulty crossing cell membranes and reaching target sites within cells. Additionally, some molecules may be metabolized by enzymes in the body into toxic metabolites that can cause adverse effects. Therefore, molecules with smaller sizes and simpler structures may be more likely to cause adverse effects than those with larger sizes and more complex structures.
Rule 3: The chemical composition of a molecule may also influence its potential for causing adverse effects. For example, metal ions such as sodium (Na) and magnesium (Mg) may not have direct interactions with biological systems but can affect the behavior of other molecules in the vicinity through electrostatic forces. Therefore, the presence of metal ions in a molecule may indirectly contribute to its potential for causing adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as "CC(C)NO" or "CCON" in its structure, then it may have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. This rule applies to molecules #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25, #26, #27, #28, #29, #30, #31, #32, #33, #34, #35, #36, #37, #38, #39, #40, #41, #42, #43, #44, #45, #46, #47, #48, #49, #50, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #5

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. The first molecule in the dataset contains a nitro group and has been labeled as having no such side effects. Therefore, this rule should be applied cautiously since there may be exceptions.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a conjugated double bond system, then it may have side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. The second molecule in the dataset contains a conjugated double bond system and has been labeled as having no such side effects. However, this rule may still hold true for other molecules containing similar structures.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. The fifth molecule in the dataset contains a sulfonyl group and has been labeled as having no such side effects. This rule should also be applied carefully due to possible exceptions.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of fluorine atom in the structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on reproduction and breast tissue. The first compound has a fluorine atom present in its structure which makes it potentially harmful for these systems.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a nitro group (-NO2) or other reactive functional groups like -SCN, -SO2NH2 etc. may have potential toxic effects due to their ability to bind with proteins and enzymes. However, this rule cannot be generalized as some molecules having such groups do not show any toxicity. The second compound contains a nitro group which may make it toxic if ingested or inhaled.
Rule 3: Molecules containing metal ions like zinc, gadolinium etc. may also exhibit certain biological activities but they should not be considered as potential drugs unless proven otherwise. The sixth compound contains a zinc ion which does not have any therapeutic use.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like "-COOH" or "-OH" in the structure of a molecule, then it may lead to adverse effects on the human body. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 for their potential side-effects on reproduction and breast disorders. For example, in the first SMILES string, the presence of "-COOH" group may increase the chances of causing adverse effects due to its acidic nature.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects such as cancer, birth defects, and other health issues. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 for their potential side-effects on reproduction and breast disorders. For instance, in the second SMILES string, the presence of "-NO2" group increases the chance of toxicity associated with the compound.
Rule 3: If a molecule has a benzene ring in its structure, it may be toxic and carcinogenic if exposed to sunlight over long periods of time. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 0 because they do not contain any structural features that suggest potential harm to humans. However, this does not mean that all compounds containing benzene rings are safe to use. It depends on various factors such as dosage, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a Gd+3 ion or a Na+ ion in its structure, then it is likely to have side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. This rule is based on the fact that these ions are often present in contrast agents used for medical imaging, which may have unintended effects on the reproductive system and breasts.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains iodine atoms, then it is unlikely to have side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. This rule is based on the observation that many drugs containing iodine atoms are known to be safe and do not affect the reproductive system or breasts.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a double bond, then it is likely to have side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. This rule is based on the fact that some chlorinated compounds are known to disrupt hormonal balance and have been linked to reproductive problems.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it may have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain this functional group and they both have labels of 1, indicating their potential side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a nitrogen atom, it may also have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and it has a label of 1, indicating its potential side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a calcium ion or a gadolinium ion, it may have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. The fourth and eighth molecules in the dataset contain these ions and they both have labels of 1, indicating their potential side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a benzene ring or a phenol group, it may have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains both a benzene ring and a phenol group.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom, it may not have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. The third molecule in the dataset violates this rule since it contains two chlorine atoms attached to different carbon atoms.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen-containing functional group such as an amide or an imine group, it may have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. The last four molecules in the dataset satisfy this rule as they contain either an amide or an imine group.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfur atom in its structure, it may have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 or 0 since there is no information about the specific type of sulfur present in each molecule.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a benzene ring in its structure, it may also have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. However, this rule only applies to molecules labeled as 1 because all molecules labeled as 0 do not contain any benzene rings.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom in its structure, it may not have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as either 1 or 0 since both types of molecules contain at least one chlorine atom.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. This rule applies to molecules #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), then it may not have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. This rule applies to molecules #3, #4, #5, #6, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or an amide group (-CONH-), then it may have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure "C#N" or "Cc1ccccc1" in its SMILES representation, then it may have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. This rule is based on the fact that some molecules containing these substructures have been shown to have endocrine disrupting activities which can affect hormone levels and lead to reproductive and breast disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure "C=NN=C" or "C=Nc1cccnc1" in its SMILES representation, then it may also have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. These substructures are similar to those found in certain types of pesticides and herbicides that have been linked to reproductive and developmental toxicity.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains the substructure "C=ON=C" or "C=Oc1ccccn1" in its SMILES representation, then it may also have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. These substructures are similar to those found in certain types of drugs such as sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones that have been associated with reproductive and developmental toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), it may have potential side effects on the reproductive system and breast tissue. The first two molecules in the list contain these groups and they both have labels indicating their possible association with such side effects.
Rule 2: Compounds containing a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a double bond between carbon atoms may also be associated with reproductive and breast health issues. This is because such compounds can bind to receptors in these tissues and disrupt normal function. The third molecule in the list has both of these features and its label supports this hypothesis.
Rule 3: Molecules with a benzene ring structure may also pose some risk for reproductive and breast health problems due to their ability to interact with estrogen receptors. However, this rule is less specific than the previous two as there are many other types of compounds that can interfere with hormone signaling. Nonetheless, the last three molecules in the list all contain benzene rings and at least one of them has a label indicating potential harm to these systems.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a benzene ring with a sulfonamide substituent (-SO2NH2), then it may have potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a benzene ring with a sulfonamide substituent (-SO2NH-), then it may have side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. The first example in the dataset contains both these features and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may also have side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders. The second example in the dataset contains this feature but has been labeled as not having such side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) bonded to a carbon atom next to a double bond (-C=C-), then it may also have side effects related to reproduction and breast disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) or carboxylic acid group (COOH) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, the first molecule contains two carbonyl groups and one carboxylic acid group, which could contribute to its side-effect activity.
Rule 2: The absence of certain structural features in a compound may decrease its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For instance, if a molecule does not contain any aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds, it may have lower toxicity than those containing these moieties. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 0 in the given dataset. For example, the second molecule lacks an aromatic ring and has no conjugated double bond, which may explain why it was classified as non-toxic.
Rule 3: The charge state of a compound can also affect its ability to interact with biological systems and potentially cause adverse effects. For example, the fifth molecule carries three negative charges due to the presence of three carboxylate ions, which may enhance its interaction with positively charged amino acids in proteins and lead to toxic effects. Therefore, it is important to consider the ionization state of a compound when predicting its toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it may have side effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders. The given SMILES string CS(=O)(=O)C1=CC(=C(C=C1)C(=O)NC2=CC(=C(C=C2)Cl)C3=CC=CC=N3)Cl has this functional group and hence has the potential for such side effects.
Rule 2: Compounds containing a cyano group (-CN) or a nitro group (-NO2) may also have side effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders. The given SMILES strings CCONC(C)C(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1 and C1CNN(C1)NC2=C(C=CC=C2Cl)Cl both contain these groups and thus have the potential for causing such adverse effects.
Rule 3: A compound having a thiocarbonyl group (-CS-) in its structure may be associated with adverse effects on the reproductive system and breast disorders. The given SMILES string CCC1=NC=CC(=C1)C(=S)N has this functional group and therefore has the potential for causing such side effects.
