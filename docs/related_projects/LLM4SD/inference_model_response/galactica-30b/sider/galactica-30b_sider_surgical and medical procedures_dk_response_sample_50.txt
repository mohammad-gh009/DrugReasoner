Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and is labeled as having the potential for adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. However, this rule should be used cautiously since there are other factors that could contribute to the toxicity of a molecule. The second molecule in the dataset contains this functional group but is labeled as not having the potential for adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (-Cl), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. This rule is based on the fact that many toxic compounds contain halogens, which can disrupt normal biochemical processes. The third molecule in the dataset contains a chlorine atom and is labeled as having the potential for adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. For example, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in the first SMILES string suggests that this molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects due to its ability to interact with biological molecules such as proteins and DNA. Similarly, the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the second SMILES string also indicates the possibility of adverse effects.
Rule 2: The molecular structure and size of a compound can also play a role in determining its toxicity. For instance, the third SMILES string contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) which is known for its toxic properties. Additionally, the length of the carbon chain in the fourth SMILES string may contribute to its toxicity since longer chains tend to be more hydrophobic and can disrupt cell membranes.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule can also affect its toxicity. For example, the fifth SMILES string contains a double bond between two carbon atoms, which creates a chiral center. The presence of a chiral center can lead to different enantiomers with potentially different biological activities. Therefore, it is important to consider both the structural features and stereochemistry of a molecule when predicting its toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as nitro group (-NO2) or halogen atoms like fluorine (-F) in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects during surgical and medical procedures. This rule can be applied to the first SMILES string where the presence of the nitro group (-NO2) and fluoride atom (-F) increases the likelihood of this molecule being associated with adverse effects.
Rule 2: A molecule containing conjugated double bonds and aromatic rings may have higher chances of causing adverse effects compared to molecules without these features. This rule can be applied to the second SMILES string where the presence of multiple conjugated double bonds and benzene ring makes this molecule more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with polar functional groups such as carboxylic acid (-COOH), primary amine (-NH2), or secondary amide (-CONHR) may have lower risks of causing adverse effects than nonpolar compounds. This rule can be applied to the third SMILES string where the absence of any polar functional groups reduces the risk of this molecule causing adverse effects.

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a bromine atom, it may have potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to the second SMILES string in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to the fourth SMILES string in the dataset.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecular formula contains sulfur atoms, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings "CC/C=C\C/C=C\C/C=C\C/C=C\C/C=C\CCCC(=O)OCC.CC/C=C\C/C=C\C/C=C\C/C=C\C/C=C\C/C=C\CCC(=O)OCC" and "CC(CC1=CC(=C(C=C1)O)O)(C(=O)O)NN".
Rule 2: If the molecule contains conjugated double bonds, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings "CCCCC(C)(C)C(C=CC1C(CC(=O)C1CCCCC=CC(=O)OC)O)O" and "C[C@]1(CN2C=C(N=C2O1)[N+](=O)[O-])COC3=CC=C(C=C3)N4CCC(CC4)OC5=CC=C(C=C5)OC(F)(F)F

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as C=ON=C, C=NO, N=OO, O=S=O, Se, COOH, Cl, Na+, Fe+3, then it may have potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a functional group such as CN, CC, CCC, CNC, NCC, NC, NN, NO, NS, OC, ON, SO, SP, PO, P(=O)(O)O, S(=O)(O)O, Si, B, Al, Ga, Ge, As, Sb, Bi, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ag, Cd, Hg, Au, Tl, Pb, or Sn, then it may not have potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. The presence of this functional group is known to increase the risk of allergic reactions and other complications. Therefore, molecules containing sulfonyl groups should be avoided or used with caution when performing surgeries or administering medications.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. Nitro compounds are known to be highly reactive and can cause tissue damage and other adverse effects. Therefore, molecules containing nitro groups should be avoided or used with caution when performing surgeries or administering medications.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. Halogen atoms can react with proteins and other biomolecules, leading to changes in their structure and function. Therefore, molecules containing halogen atoms should be avoided or used with caution when performing surgeries or administering medications.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds between carbon atoms, then it may have potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a linear chain of five double bonds between carbon atoms. However, further analysis would be needed to determine if this molecule actually causes any side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures. The third molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a nitro group attached to one of its aromatic rings. Again, further analysis would be needed to determine if this molecule actually causes any side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may have potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures. The sixth molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a sulfonamide group attached to one of its aromatic rings. This molecule is known to cause allergic reactions in some people and should be used with caution during surgical or medical procedures.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of functional groups such as nitro group or halogen atoms like chlorine in the molecular structure, then it may lead to potential side effects during surgery or medical procedures. The presence of these groups increases the reactivity of the compound which can interact with other molecules causing harm. Therefore, it is important to avoid using compounds containing these groups for surgical or medical purposes.
Rule 2: If the molecular formula contains nitrogen and oxygen atoms, it may indicate the possibility of having toxic side effects due to the formation of reactive intermediates upon exposure to certain conditions. For example, if the compound has a nitrile group attached to its structure, it can be easily converted into cyanide ions under acidic conditions leading to toxicity. Hence, it is essential to exercise caution while handling such compounds.
Rule 3: If the molecular weight of the compound is high, it may increase the likelihood of absorption through skin or mucous membranes resulting in systemic toxicity. It is recommended to use compounds with lower molecular weights for surgical or medical applications.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. The first two molecules in the dataset contain this functional group and they both have labels of 1, indicating their potential for causing side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. The third molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and it has a label of 1, indicating its potential for causing side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as fluorine (-F) or chlorine (-Cl), it may also have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. The fourth and fifth molecules in the dataset contain these atoms and they both have labels of 1, indicating their potential for causing side effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, and cyano groups in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. These functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to negative outcomes. Therefore, compounds containing these functional groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: Molecules with complex ring structures or multiple conjugated double bonds may also have higher risks of causing adverse effects due to their high reactivity and ability to form strong interactions with other molecules. Such compounds should be used cautiously or avoided altogether.
Rule 3: Compounds with aromatic rings or halogen atoms such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine may have lower risks of causing adverse effects compared to those without them. However, they still need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis depending on their specific chemical structure and application.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N, then it may have side effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule is based on the fact that this substructure is present in two molecules labeled as having side effects (SMILES strings "C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N.CC(=O)O.C1=CC(=CC=C1C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N)O.C(CCN)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N.C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N 1" and "C1CNN(Cc2ccccc2n2nc(C)nc(C)c2nn2C)NN1C#N") but absent from all other molecules in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure CC(F)(F)F, then it may not have side effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule is based on the fact that this substructure is only present in one molecule labeled as not having side effects (SMILES string "C1C(=S)N(C2=C(C=C(C=C2)Cl)C(=N1)C3=CC=CC=C3F)CC(F)(F)F 0") among all the molecules in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects during surgery or medical procedures. For example, the molecule represented by SMILES string CC1=NC2=C(N1)CCN(C3=CC=CC=C32)C(=O)C4=CC=C(C=C4)NC(=O)C5=CC=CC=C5C6=CC=CC=C6 0 contains a nitro group (-NO2) which is known to be toxic and potentially harmful if ingested or inhaled. Therefore, this molecule may have the potential to cause adverse effects when used in surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 2: Some molecules may contain metal ions such as gadolinium (Gd), sodium (Na), lithium (Li) etc. These metals may interact with other substances present in the body and lead to adverse reactions. For instance, the molecule C[C@@]1(C2C[C@H]3[C@@H](C(=O)C(=C([C@]3(C(=O)C2=C(C4=C1C=CC=C4O)O)O)O)C(=O)NCNCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)N)N(C)C)O 0 contains Gd ion which may interfere with normal physiological processes and cause toxicity. Therefore, caution should be

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. For example, the molecule C[C@]12C[C@@H]([C@]3([C@H]([C@@H]1C[C@@H]4[C@]2(OC(O4)(C)C)C(=O)CO)CCC5=CC(=O)C=C[C@@]53C)F)O contains a fluorine atom which is known to increase the risk of adverse reactions. Therefore, this molecule has a higher chance of causing adverse effects compared to molecules without such functional groups.
Rule 2: The structure of a molecule plays a crucial role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects. For instance, the molecule CC(C)CN(C[C@H]([C@H](CC1=CC=CC=C1)NC(=O)O[C@H]2CCOC2)OP(=O)([O-])[O-])S(=O)(=O)C3=CC=C(C=C3)N.[Ca+2] contains a calcium ion which may interact with the molecule and affect its function. This interaction could potentially lead to adverse effects if the molecule is used during surgery or medical procedures.
Rule 3: The charge on a molecule can also influence its ability to cause adverse effects. For example, the molecule CON=C(C1=CSC(=N1)N)C(=O)NC2C3N(C2=O)C(=CCS3)

Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. The first example in the dataset contains a sulfur atom bonded to two oxygen atoms, which suggests the presence of a sulfonyl group. Therefore, this molecule may have side effects during surgery or medical procedures.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom that is part of a ring structure, it may have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. The second example in the dataset contains a chlorine atom connected to a six-membered ring structure. This molecule may also have side effects during surgery or medical procedures.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbonyl group (-C=O) and another nitrogen atom, it may have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. The third example in the dataset contains a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbonyl group and another nitrogen atom, as well as a double bond between two carbon atoms. This molecule may have side effects during surgery or medical procedures.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in its structure, then it may have side effects during surgical or medical procedures. The presence of this functional group may increase the risk of adverse reactions during surgery or medication administration.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms in its structure, then it may have side effects during surgical or medical procedures. This functional group is commonly found in drugs such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen, which are known to cause liver damage and other adverse reactions.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfur atom bonded to one carbon atom and one oxygen atom in its structure, then it may have side effects during surgical or medical procedures. This functional group is present in many common medications like penicillin and sulfa antibiotics, which can cause allergic reactions and other complications.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group called "nitrile" (-CN), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. The presence of this functional group indicates that the molecule may be toxic and could potentially harm tissues or organs during surgery or medical treatment.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a metal ion such as gallium (Ga) or gadolinium (Gd), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. These metals may interfere with the normal functioning of cells or tissues, leading to complications or adverse reactions during surgery or medical treatment.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a functional group called "carbonyl" (-C=O), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. This functional group is commonly found in many organic compounds and is essential for their biological activities. However, excessive exposure to these molecules may still lead to negative health outcomes, so caution should always be exercised when using them.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group called "carbonyl" (represented by the symbol C=O) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the dataset. For example, the first molecule in the dataset contains two carbonyl groups and is labeled as 1, indicating that it may have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a functional group called "cyano" (represented by the symbol CN) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule also applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the dataset. For example, the fifth molecule in the dataset contains one cyano group and is labeled as 1, indicating that it may have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (represented by the symbol Cl) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as either 0 or 1 in the dataset. For example, the thirteenth molecule in the dataset contains one chlorine atom and is labeled as 0, indicating that it does not necessarily have the potential to cause adverse effects. However, since there are other examples of molecules containing halogens that are labeled as 1, this rule should be taken with caution until further research is conducted.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom, then it may have potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules numbered 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom, then it may not have potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules numbered 3 and 5 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules numbered 13 and 14 in the dataset.
Note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the dataset and should be used as a starting point for further analysis rather than definitive conclusions.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group called "nitro" (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules numbered 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a functional group called "carbonyl" (-C=O), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 11 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (-C6H5), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules numbered 12, 13, 14, and 15 in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. For example, the molecule represented by SMILES string CNC(=O)C1=NC=CC(=C1)OC2=CC=C(C=C2)NC(=O)NC3=CC(=C(C=C3)Cl)C(F)(F)F contains a nitro group (-NO2) which is known to be toxic and potentially harmful if ingested or inhaled. Therefore, this molecule may have the potential to cause adverse effects when used in surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 2: Certain structural features such as double bonds, triple bonds, and aromatic rings may also contribute to the potential toxicity of a molecule. For instance, the molecule C1=C/C(=C/2\N/C(=C\3/C=CC=CC3=O)/N(N2)C4=CC=C(C=C4)C(=O)O)/C(=O)C=C1 has a conjugated diene structure which is known to be highly reactive and may interact with other molecules in the body leading to adverse effects.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound may affect its ability to cross cell membranes and reach target sites within the body. Molecules with high molecular weights and hydrophobic properties may be more likely to accumulate in tissues and organs, leading to adverse effects. For example, the molecule CCC(

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. For example, the molecule with SMILES string CC1C(C(CC(O1)OC2CC(CC3=C(C4=C(C(=C23)O)C(=O)C5=C(C4=O)C=CC=C5OC)O)(C(=O)CO)O)[NH3+])O has a positively charged nitrogen atom which could interact with negatively charged molecules on cell membranes, potentially leading to harmful reactions. Therefore, this molecule should be labeled as 1 since it has a high potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: The absence of specific functional groups in a molecule may decrease its likelihood of causing adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. For instance, the molecule with SMILES string C1CC(N(C1)C(=O)C(CC2=CN=CN2)NC(=O)C3CCC(=O)N3)C(=O)N does not have any oxygen-containing functional group, so it may not interact strongly with biological systems and therefore should be labeled as 0.
Rule 3: The molecular structure and charge distribution of a molecule can also affect its ability to cause adverse effects. For example, the molecule with SMILES string CCC(=O)OCC(=O)C1(C(CC2C1(CC(C3(C2CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC43C)

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it may have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. The first SMILES string in the dataset contains such a group and is labeled as having no side effects. Therefore, this rule should be applied cautiously since there might be other factors involved besides the presence of a sulfonyl group.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. The second SMILES string in the dataset contains such a group and is also labeled as having no side effects. However, this rule should still be considered because fluorination is often used in drug design to modify chemical and physical properties of molecules.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) connected to a benzene ring through a single bond, then it may have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. This structure appears in the fifth SMILES string in the dataset and is labeled as having no side effects. Again, this rule should be applied carefully due to the complexity of biological systems.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of chlorine atom in the structure of the molecule, then it may have potential for causing adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. The presence of halogen atoms like chlorine can increase the reactivity of molecules which can lead to unwanted interactions with other molecules inside the body. This rule applies to the first two SMILES strings provided where the presence of Cl atoms makes them more likely to exhibit side-effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains multiple rings or conjugated systems, it may also be associated with increased risk of adverse effects due to their ability to interact with other molecules within the body. This rule applies to the third and fourth SMILES strings provided where the presence of multiple aromatic rings increases the likelihood of interaction with biological targets.
Rule 3: If the molecule has a functional group that is known to react with proteins or enzymes, it may pose a higher risk of inducing adverse effects. For example, the fifth SMILES string contains a nitro group which is known to be reactive and can potentially bind to proteins leading to toxicity. Therefore, this rule suggests that molecules containing such groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile before being used in surgical or medical procedures.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. For example, the sulfonamide group present in the second SMILES string "CCS(=O)(=O)CCN1C(=NC=C1[N+](=O)[O-])C" suggests that this compound could have anti-bacterial properties which could potentially lead to adverse reactions if used during surgery.
Rule 2: The molecular structure and geometry of a compound can also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects. For instance, the third SMILES string "CC1=C2C(C(=O)C3(C(CC4C(C3C(C(C2(C)C)(CC1OC(=O)C(C(C5=CC=CC=C5)NC(=O)C6=CC=CC=C6)O)O)OC(=O)C7=CC=CC=C7)(CO4)OC(=O)C)O)C)OC(=O)C" contains a conjugated system of double bonds which may increase its reactivity and potential for toxicity.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule's carbon chain can also affect its biological activity and potential for causing adverse effects. For example, the sixth SMILES string "CC(=O)OCC(=O)C12C(CC3C1(CC(C4(C3CC(C5=CC(=O)C=CC54C

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects during surgery or medical procedures. The presence of these groups in the chemical structure indicates that the compound has antimicrobial properties which could potentially harm the body's natural bacterial flora if administered systemically at high doses. This could lead to infections or other complications during surgery or medical procedures. Therefore, molecules containing such functional groups should be avoided for use in surgeries or medical treatments unless they are proven safe through rigorous testing.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a halogen atom like chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), then it may also have potential side effects during surgery or medical procedures. These atoms are known to disrupt normal cellular processes by reacting with proteins and enzymes within cells. They can also increase the risk of infection due to their ability to inhibit the growth of certain bacteria. Therefore, molecules containing halogens should be used cautiously in surgeries or medical treatments until their safety has been thoroughly evaluated.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains multiple aromatic rings connected together via conjugated double bonds, then it may have potential side effects during surgery or medical procedures. Such structures are often associated with increased toxicity and reactivity, making them more likely to interact with biological systems and cause adverse reactions. Therefore, molecules containing such structural features should be used with caution in surgeries or medical treatments until their safety has been established through thorough testing.

Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in patients undergoing surgery or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CN1C2=C(C=C(C=C2)N(CCCl)CCCl)N=C1CCCC(=O)O and CC1=C(C(=CC=C1)Cl)NC(=O)C2=CN=C(S2)NC3=NC(=NC(=C3)N4CCN(CC4)CCO)C.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a furan ring (a five-membered heterocyclic aromatic compound containing oxygen and carbon atoms), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in patients undergoing surgery or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings COC1=CC(=CC(=C1O)OC)C2C3C(COC3=O)C(C4=CC5=C(C=C24)OCO5)OC6C(C(C7C(O6)COC(O7)C8=CC=CS8)O)O and C1CN(P(=O)(OC1)NCCCl)CCCl.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains two identical functional groups connected through a double bond, it may potentially cause adverse effects in patients undergoing surgery or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CCCCCCCC1=CC=C(C=C1)CCC(CO)(CO)N.Cl and CCN(C)NN=C1C(=NC=N1)C(=O)N. However, this rule should be applied cautiously as there may be other factors involved in causing adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings C1=NC2=C(N1[C@H]3[C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O3)CO)O)F)N=C(N=C2N)Cl, CC1=NN=C2N1C3=C(C=C(C=C3)Cl)C(=NC2)C4=CC=CC=C4Cl, CN(C)CCCN1C2=CC=CC=C2CCC3=C1C=C(C=C3)Cl, C[C@@H]1[C@@H]2[C@H](C(=O)N2C(=C1S[C@H]3C[C@H](NC3)CNS(=O)(=O)N)C(=O)O)[C@@H](C)O, C1=CC(=CC=C1COC(CN2C=CN=C2)C3=C(C=C(C=C3)Cl)Cl)Cl, CCC(C)(C)C#CC=CCN(C)CC1=CC=CC2=CC=CC=C21, CCN1C2=C(C=C(C=C2)Cl)C(=NC(C1=O)O)C3=CC=CC=C3Cl, CCCCCCCCCC

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of cyano group (-CN) in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. The given SMILES string contains one such group which is represented as "C#N". Therefore, this rule suggests that molecules containing "C#N" should be avoided if they are used for surgical or medical purposes.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also lead to adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. However, the given SMILES strings do not contain any such groups. Hence, this rule cannot be applied here.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a halogen atom like chlorine (Cl) attached to a benzene ring, then it may lead to adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. The second SMILES string in the given set contains Cl attached to a benzene ring, so this rule applies to it. This indicates that molecules having chlorobenzene moiety should be avoided while using them for surgical or medical purposes.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of chlorine atom in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects during surgery or medical procedures. This rule applies to compounds with SMILES strings starting with "Cl" as shown in the first example.
Rule 2: Compounds containing functional groups such as carbonyl groups (C=O), amide bonds (-CONH-), and ester bonds (-COOR) have higher chances of causing adverse effects if they are present in the structure. These functional groups may interact with biological molecules leading to unwanted reactions. For instance, the second example contains two carbonyl groups which could potentially react with other molecules resulting in toxicity.
Rule 3: Molecules with aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds tend to be more reactive than those without these features. Therefore, compounds with these structural characteristics should be evaluated carefully for their potential to cause adverse effects. As seen in the third example, the compound has both an aromatic ring and a conjugated double bond which increase its reactivity and make it more likely to cause harm.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. The second molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has also been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, it may also have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. This includes molecules containing aromatic rings, such as the third and fourth molecules in the dataset. These molecules have been labeled as potentially causing side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. The presence of this functional group in certain drugs such as penicillin and other antibiotics is known to cause allergic reactions in some patients. Therefore, it is important to consider the structure of the molecule when predicting its potential side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. Nitro compounds are commonly used as explosives but they can also cause irritation and damage to tissues. It is recommended to avoid using these types of molecules in medical applications unless necessary.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) attached to a carbon atom, then it may also have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. Halogen atoms can react with proteins and enzymes in the body, causing tissue damage and inflammation. It is important to carefully evaluate the chemical structure of any new drug candidate before administering it to patients.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, nitro, or halogen groups in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects during surgical and medical procedures.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, which could lead to negative consequences. Therefore, they should be avoided when designing new drugs or chemicals used in surgical and medical procedures.
Rule 2: Molecules containing conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings may also pose a risk of causing adverse effects during surgical and medical procedures due to their ability to absorb light energy and generate reactive oxygen species.
Explanation: These structures can undergo oxidation reactions under certain conditions, leading to the formation of free radicals that can damage cells and tissues. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using compounds with these structures in surgical and medical procedures.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound may also affect its potential to cause adverse effects during surgical and medical procedures. Compounds with high molecular weights and hydrophobicities tend to accumulate in lipid membranes and interfere with their normal functions.
Explanation: This property makes them more likely to cause membrane disruption and cellular toxicity, which could lead to adverse outcomes. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the selection of compounds with appropriate molecular weights and hydrophobilities when designing new drugs or chemicals for use in surgical and medical procedures.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group called "nitro" (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures. The presence of this functional group in a compound can increase its reactivity and toxicity, which could lead to unwanted reactions in the body. Therefore, molecules containing nitro groups should be avoided when designing drugs for use in surgery or medicine.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, such as a benzene ring or a chain of alternating single and double bonds, then it may also have potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures. Conjugated systems can increase the stability of radicals formed by the molecule, leading to increased reactivity and potentially harmful interactions with other molecules in the body. Therefore, molecules containing conjugated systems should be carefully evaluated for their safety before being used in surgical or medical settings.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a long carbon chain with multiple branches, such as those found in fatty acids, then it may also have potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures. Long carbon chains can make the molecule more flexible and hydrophobic, which can affect its solubility and ability to cross cell membranes. This can lead to unwanted interactions between the molecule and cellular components, potentially causing harm to the patient. Therefore, molecules containing long carbon chains should be carefully evaluated for their safety before being used in surgical or medical settings.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in patients undergoing surgery or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules 7, 8, and 9.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in patients undergoing surgery or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules 10 and 11.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains both a sulfonamide group and a nitro group, it may have even greater potential to cause adverse effects in patients undergoing surgery or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecule 12 only.
