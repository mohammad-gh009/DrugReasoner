Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as a carbonyl group (C=O) or a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in certain social situations. This rule is supported by the first two molecules in the dataset, which both contain carbonyl groups and have labels of 1 indicating they may cause adverse effects under certain conditions.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its high reactivity. This rule is supported by the third molecule in the dataset, which contains a nitro group and has a label of 1 indicating it may cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects through covalent binding to biological targets. This rule is supported by the fifth molecule in the dataset, which contains a chlorine atom and has a label of 1 indicating it may cause adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfhydryl group (-SH) or a positively charged phosphorus atom (-PH+), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 8, 9, and 10 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a negatively charged oxygen atom (-OO-), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 11 and 12 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, such as a benzene ring or a chain of alternating single and double bonds, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules 13 and 14 in the dataset.
It's important to note that these rules are just suggestions and should not be used as the sole basis for predicting adverse effects without further testing and analysis.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in certain social situations. The first example in the dataset contains both groups and is labeled as having adverse effects due to social circumstances.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in certain social situations. The third example in the dataset contains a chlorine atom and is labeled as having adverse effects due to social circumstances.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects by interfering with normal cellular processes. The sixth example in the dataset contains a conjugated system of double bonds and is labeled as having adverse effects due to social circumstances.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of cyanide group (-CN) in the structure of a molecule, then it may have potential to cause adverse effects on social circumstances. The given SMILES string contains two molecules having cyano groups and both of them have been labeled as 1 which indicates their relation to the side-effect activity associated with social circumstances.
Rule 2: If a molecule has a nitro group (-NO2) present in its structure, then it may also be responsible for causing adverse effects on social circumstances. However, this rule cannot be generalized as only one molecule containing a nitro group was provided in the dataset and it was labeled as 0 indicating no association with any type of side-effects or activities.
Rule 3: If a molecule has a benzene ring (-C6H5) attached to it, then it may potentially lead to adverse effects on social circumstances. This rule is based on the fact that many drugs and chemicals containing benzene rings have been reported to exhibit toxic and carcinogenic properties. One such example is the molecule represented by the given SMILES string which has a benzene ring attached to it and has been labeled as 1 indicating its possible relationship with the side-effect activity associated with social circumstances.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to social circumstances based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have side effects related to social circumstances. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and have labels of 0, indicating they do not have such side effects. However, further research would need to be done to confirm this hypothesis.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to nitrogen, then it may have side effects related to social circumstances. The third molecule in the dataset contains this group and has a label of 1, indicating it does have such side effects. This suggests that halogenated compounds may be more likely to have such side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrile group (-CN), then it may not have side effects related to social circumstances. None of the molecules in the dataset containing this group have labels of 1, suggesting that they do not have such side effects. Further research would need to be done to confirm this hypothesis.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to social circumstances based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a similar functional group, it may have side effects related to social circumstances. The presence of this group in certain drugs such as sulfamethoxazole and sulfasalazine has been linked to hypersensitivity reactions, which can range from mild skin rashes to severe anaphylactic shock.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have side effects related to social circumstances. Nitro compounds are known to cause methemoglobinemia, a condition where the body's ability to carry oxygen is impaired due to the presence of abnormal hemoglobin molecules. This can lead to symptoms such as headache, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains multiple conjugated double bonds, it may also have side effects related to social circumstances. Conjugated double bonds allow for electron delocalization, which can affect the molecule's reactivity and biological activity. For example, some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzo[a]pyrene have been shown to have carcinogenic properties.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to social circumstances based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to molecules in rows 7 and 8 of the table.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a silver ion (Ag+) or a guanidine group (-CNHC(=NH)NH-), it may also have potential side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to molecules in row 9 and column 2 of the table.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to molecules in columns 3 and 4 of the table.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to social circumstances based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a similar functional group, it may have side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to molecules #8, #9, and #10 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a similar functional group, it may have side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to molecules #11 and #12 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring or a similar aromatic system, it may have side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to molecules #13 and #14 in the dataset.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided by the given dataset and should be used with caution until further research and testing can confirm their validity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in certain individuals. The presence of this functional group is known to cause allergic reactions in some people. Therefore, molecules containing this group should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxicity before being administered to patients.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in certain individuals. Nitro groups are known to be toxic and can cause tissue damage or cell death when they interact with other molecules in the body. Therefore, molecules containing this group should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxicity before being administered to patients.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in certain individuals. Halogen atoms can interfere with normal biochemical processes in the body and can lead to organ damage or other health problems. Therefore, molecules containing these elements should be carefully evaluated for their potential toxicity before being administered to patients.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a nitrile group (-CN), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in certain social situations. This rule is supported by the first two SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the dataset. The presence of these functional groups may increase the reactivity of the molecule and make it more likely to interact with biological systems in ways that lead to negative outcomes.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects when exposed to certain environmental conditions such as high temperatures or acidic environments. This rule is supported by the fifth SMILES string labeled as 1 in the dataset. These functional groups may be sensitive to changes in pH or temperature, which could affect their stability and potentially lead to unwanted reactions.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) attached to a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its ability to bind to receptors in the body. This rule is supported by the third and fourth SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the dataset. Halogenated benzenes are known to be toxic and have been linked to a variety of health problems including cancer and reproductive issues.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carboxylic acid or its derivatives in a compound may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects due to their ability to bind to proteins and disrupt normal cellular processes. Therefore, compounds containing these functional groups should be carefully evaluated for potential side effects.
Rule 2: Compounds with aromatic rings may also have increased toxicity due to their ability to interact with biological molecules through π-π stacking interactions. Therefore, compounds containing aromatic rings should also be evaluated cautiously for potential side effects.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a compound's structure may also affect its toxicity. Longer and more complex structures may have greater flexibility and the ability to interact with multiple targets within cells, increasing the likelihood of disrupting normal cellular functions. Therefore, simpler compounds with fewer functional groups and less structural complexity may be safer to use.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to social circumstances based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to the first SMILES string in the dataset where there is a nitro group present.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a conjugated system consisting of multiple double bonds separated by single bonds, then it may have side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to the second SMILES string in the dataset where there is a conjugated system present.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfhydryl group (-SH) or a phosphine group (-PH2), then it may have side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to the fourth and fifth SMILES strings in the dataset where there are either a sulfhydryl or a phosphine group present.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) in a molecule may indicate potential side effects due to its ability to bind to proteins and disrupt their function. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should be labeled as having possible side effects.
Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic rings such as pyridine or pyrimidine may also have potential side effects due to their ability to interact with biological systems. Therefore, these types of structures should also be considered when predicting side effects.
Rule 3: The presence of certain functional groups such as sulfonamide or nitro groups may increase the likelihood of side effects. However, these relationships are more complex and require further investigation before any definitive conclusions can be drawn.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in certain social situations. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having no association with any adverse effects. However, further research would need to be done to confirm this hypothesis.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a fluoroquinolone group (-C9FQ-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its antibacterial properties. The second molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has also been labeled as having no association with any adverse effects. Again, more research would be needed to confirm this hypothesis.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains both a cyano group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects by acting as a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. This is because these two groups are present in acetazolamide, which is known to inhibit carbonic anhydrase and cause adverse effects such as fatigue, dizziness, and nausea. The third molecule in the dataset contains both of these functional groups and has been labeled as having some association with adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in certain social situations. The presence of these functional groups indicates that the molecule may interact with biological systems in ways that could lead to negative outcomes.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects by inhibiting enzymes involved in important metabolic processes. These functional groups can form hydrogen bonds with amino acids in enzyme active sites, which can interfere with their function.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, such as a phenyl ring or a naphthalene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its ability to absorb light energy and generate reactive oxygen species. This property can lead to oxidative stress and damage to cellular components.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The first molecule in the dataset contains a sulfonyl group and is labeled as having no adverse effects. However, this rule should be taken with caution since other factors such as dosage and individual susceptibility also play a role in determining the toxicity of a compound.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The fifth molecule in the dataset contains a nitro group and is labeled as having no adverse effects. Again, this rule should be taken with caution since other factors such as dosage and individual susceptibility also play a role in determining the toxicity of a compound.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. The last two molecules in the dataset contain halogens and are labeled as having no adverse effects. This rule is supported by research showing that halogen atoms can increase the reactivity of a molecule and potentially lead to toxic reactions.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to social circumstances based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains two or more negatively charged oxygen atoms in its structure, then it may have side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with C(=O)([O-])[O-].. For example, the first molecule in the dataset satisfies this condition and has been labeled as having no side effects. However, further analysis would be needed to confirm any correlation between this structural feature and side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in a ring structure, then it may have side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with CC12...CC(C)(C)FF. For example, the fourth molecule in the dataset satisfies this condition and has been labeled as having no side effects. Again, further analysis would be needed to confirm any correlation between this structural feature and side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbonyl group (C=O), then it may have side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with NC(C)C(=O)N2.... For example, the second molecule in the dataset satisfies this condition and has been labeled as having no side effects. Once again, further analysis would be needed to confirm any correlation between this structural feature and side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a phosphorus atom bonded to four carbon atoms in a ring structure, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to social circumstances. The SMILES string for this molecule is CCONCP(CCOP(CCOCC)CCOCC)CCOCC.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a naphthalene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to social circumstances. The SMILES string for this molecule is CN(C)CCCN1C2=CC=CC=C2CCC3=C1C=C(C=C3)Cl.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to social circumstances. The SMILES strings for these molecules are CCOCCP(CCOCC)CCP(CCOCC)CCOCC or CCC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(C)CCC2=CC=C(C=C2)[N+](C)(C)C.[Cl-].
It's important to note that these rules are just suggestions based on the limited information provided in the dataset. Further research and analysis would be needed to confirm their validity and applicability to other situations.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a nitro group (NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CCON1C(=O)C2(C(=O)NC(=O)C(C)(C)O2)c2ccccc2n(C)c1C and CCC1(C(=O)Nc2ccco2nc1C)C respectively in the provided dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1=CC=C(C(=C1)C(C2=CC=C(C=C2)Cl)C(Cl)Cl)Cl and CN1C2=C(C=C(C=C2)C(=O)N(CCC(=O)O)C3=CC=CC=N3)N=C1CNC4=CC=C(C=C4)C(=N)N respectively in the provided dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen-containing ring such as pyridine or pyrimidine, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. This

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to social circumstances based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) or a carbonyl group (-COR), then it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to molecules CCC(=O)OCC(=O)[C@]1([C@H](C[C@@H]2[C@@]1(C[C@@H]([C@]3([C@H]2CCC4=CC(=O)C=C[C@@]43C)F)O)C)C)OC(=O)CC, CC(CCCN)NC1=C2C(=CC(=C1)OC)C=CC=N2, C1[C@H]([C@@H]2[C@H](O1)[C@H](CO2)O)O, COC1=C(C(=NC=C1)CS(=O)C2=NC3=C(N2)C=C(C=C3)OC(F)F)OC, CCSCCC1=C(C2=CC=CC=C2O1)C(=O)C3=CC(=C(C(=C3)I)OCC[NH+](CC)

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three possible rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in certain social situations. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having potential side-effects due to social circumstances.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains two bromine atoms attached to adjacent carbon atoms in its structure, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. The second molecule in the dataset contains this structural feature and has also been labeled as having potential side-effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains both a nitro group (-NO2) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects by reacting with other molecules or disrupting normal cellular processes. The third molecule in the dataset contains these functional groups and has also been labeled as having potential side-effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom, then it is likely to have side-effect activity related to social circumstances. This rule applies to the first SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom, then it may have side-effect activity related to social circumstances. This rule applies to the second SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 0.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a cyano group (-CN), then it is unlikely to have any side-effect activity related to social circumstances. This rule applies to the last two SMILES strings in the dataset labeled as 0.
It's important to note that these rules are just educated guesses based on the limited information provided in the dataset. Further research and analysis would be needed to confirm their validity and applicability to other molecules and scenarios.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects if they interact with biological systems in unexpected ways. For example, the carbonyl group (C=O) present in the first SMILES string could be responsible for the observed side-effects due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds or react with other molecules. Therefore, identifying and analyzing such functional groups can provide valuable insights into the potential toxicity of a compound.
Rule 2: The structure of a molecule can also play a role in determining its toxicity. For instance, the second SMILES string contains a chlorinated acetyl group (Cl-C(=O)-CH3) which has been associated with increased toxicity compared to non-chlorinated analogues. This suggests that compounds containing halogenated functional groups should be given closer scrutiny when evaluating their safety profiles.
Rule 3: The third rule highlights the importance of considering the context in which a molecule is used. For example, the fourth SMILES string contains a reactive double bond (C=S) which could potentially undergo nucleophilic attack by cellular components leading to toxic effects. However, this same reactivity could also make the compound useful as a therapeutic agent if it can be targeted to specific tissues or cells. Therefore, predicting the toxicity of a compound requires careful consideration of both its chemical structure and its intended use.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in certain social situations. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "CS(=O)(=O)N" or "CNS(=O)(=O)N". For example, the first molecule in the dataset contains a sulfonamide group and is labeled as having potential adverse effects due to social circumstances.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in certain social situations. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings containing "NO2". For example, the third molecule in the dataset contains a nitro group and is labeled as having potential adverse effects due to social circumstances.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or iodine (I), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects regardless of social circumstances. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings containing Cl or I atoms. For example, the sixth molecule in the dataset contains two chlorines and is labeled as having potential adverse effects even without any specific social context.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects if they interact with biological systems in unexpected ways. For example, the nitro group (-NO2) in the first SMILES string could be potentially harmful due to its ability to form reactive oxygen species and disrupt cellular redox balance. Similarly, the sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in the second SMILES string has been associated with a range of adverse reactions including hypersensitivity, skin rashes, and liver damage.
Rule 2: The molecular geometry and electronic configuration of a compound can also affect its toxicity. For instance, the third SMILES string contains a strained three-membered ring which may make it more susceptible to degradation or reaction with other molecules. Additionally, the fourth SMILES string features a conjugated system of double bonds which can enhance its reactivity towards biological targets such as enzymes or receptors.
Rule 3: The physical and chemical properties of a substance, such as solubility, lipophilicity, and stability, can influence its bioavailability and bioaccumulation within the body. For example, the fifth SMILES string contains a carbamate group (-NHC(=O)O-) which can undergo hydrolysis under physiological conditions to release toxic metabolites. Furthermore, the sixth SMILES string includes a chlorinated aromatic ring which may facilitate oxidative metabolism and generate reactive intermediates.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of fluorine atom in the structure, then it may lead to potential adverse effects. The first SMILES string has a fluorine atom and hence it belongs to label 1.
Rule 2: If there is a presence of nitro group in the structure, then it may also lead to potential adverse effects. The second SMILES string has a nitro group and hence it belongs to label 1.
Rule 3: If there is a presence of carbonyl group in the structure, then it may be associated with potential adverse effects. The third SMILES string has two carbonyl groups and hence it belongs to label 1.
Based on these three rules, we can classify all the given molecules into their respective labels as shown below:
SMILES String Label  
CC1=C(C(=O)N2CCCC(C2=N1)O)CCN3CCC(CC3)C4=NOC5=C4C=CC(=C5)F 1

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to social circumstances based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to the SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the dataset. For example, the first SMILES string contains a nitro group and is labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to a cyclopropane ring, then it may have side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to the third SMILES string labeled as 1. The presence of both groups suggests that the molecule may have some biological activity.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) attached to a benzene ring, then it may have side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to the seventh SMILES string labeled as 1. Halogen atoms are often present in drugs and can affect their chemical and physical properties.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three possible rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to social circumstances based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds between carbon atoms, then it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. This rule is based on the fact that many molecules that have such systems are known to have biological activities, including toxicity. The specific type of conjugation (e.g. aromatic or non-aromatic) does not seem to matter for this prediction.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a polar functional group (such as a carbonyl group, a hydroxyl group, or an amine group), then it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. This rule is based on the idea that these groups can interact with other molecules in the body and potentially disrupt their normal functions. However, it's important to note that polarity alone cannot guarantee toxicity, so additional factors should also be considered.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a charged atom (such as sodium or chloride), then it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. This rule is based on the idea that charged molecules can interact with other charged molecules and potentially disrupt their normal functions. Again, however, it's important to note that charge alone cannot guarantee toxicity, so additional factors should also be considered.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in social situations. The first two molecules in the dataset contain this functional group and both have labels of 0, indicating they do not have any known association with social circumstances. However, further research would need to be done to confirm this hypothesis.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a metal ion such as sodium or iron, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in social situations. The third molecule in the dataset contains both sodium and iron ions and has a label of 0, again indicating no known association with social circumstances. Further research would need to be done to determine if these metals contribute to any potential negative effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a conjugated system consisting of alternating double bonds and single bonds, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in social situations. The sixth molecule in the dataset contains this structural feature and has a label of 1, indicating there is some evidence to suggest it does have an association with social circumstances. This rule should be taken with caution however, as there may be other factors at play that were not accounted for in this analysis.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to social circumstances based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as chlorine (-Cl) attached to a benzene ring, then it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "C[NH+](C)[C@H]1[C@@H]2C[C@@H]3[C@@H](C4=C(C=CC(=C4C(=C3C(=O)[C@@]2(C(=O)C(=C(N)[O-])C1=O)O)O)O)Cl)O", "C[C@@H](C(=O)N1CC2=CC=CC=C2C[C@H]1C(=O)O)N[C@@H](CCC3=CC=CC=C3)C(=O)O", "CC1=C2[C@@H](C(=O)[C@@]3([C@H](C[C@@H]4[C@]([C@H]3[C@@H]([C@@](C2(C)C)(C[C@@H]1OC(=O)[C@@H]([C@H](C5=CC=CC=C5)NC(=O)

Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "CC1(C(N2C(S1)C(C2=O)NC(=O)COC3=CC=CC=C3)C(=O)[O-])C" or "CCCNC1CCC2=C(C1)SC(=N2)N".
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorinated benzene ring (-C6H4Cl-), then it may have side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=C(C2=CC=CC=C2)C3=CC=C(C=C3)OCCO)CCCl".
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a cyclopropane ring connected to a carbonyl group (-C3H5-C(=O)-), then it may have side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "CCC(C)C(=O)OC1CC(C=C2C1C(C(

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of chlorine atom in the structure, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects. The given SMILES string contains two such instances where Cl is present and they have been labeled as 1 which indicates their potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: If there is a presence of nitro group (-NO2) or any other reactive functional groups like -COOH, -OH etc. in the structure, then it also has a high probability of causing adverse effects. However, this rule cannot be applied here since none of these groups are present in the given SMILES strings.
Rule 3: If the molecular weight of the compound is greater than 500 Daltons, then it may have a higher chance of causing adverse effects due to its larger size and complexity. This rule cannot be applied here either because all the given SMILES strings have a molecular weight less than 500 Daltons.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to social circumstances based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in a ring structure, then it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to the second SMILES string in the dataset where there is a chloroalkane group present.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a cyano group attached to a benzene ring, then it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to the fourth SMILES string in the dataset where there is a benzonitrile group present.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group, then it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to the eleventh SMILES string in the dataset where there is a sulfonamide group present.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains iron ions (Fe+3) or sodium ions (Na+) in its structure, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to their ability to interact with other molecules in the body.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5) or a pyridine ring (C5H5N) in its structure, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects as these rings are commonly found in many toxic compounds.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a functional group such as a carbonyl group (C=O) or a thiocarbonyl group (C=S), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects as these groups can react with other molecules in the body and disrupt normal cellular processes.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group such as a carbonyl group (C=O) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in certain social situations. This rule is supported by the fact that these groups are known to be toxic and can interact with biological systems in harmful ways.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects due to their ability to disrupt biological processes. These atoms can act as electron-withdrawing groups, which can alter the reactivity of nearby functional groups and affect their interactions with other molecules.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (R-SO2NH2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects because this group is known to be antibacterial and can interfere with the growth of bacteria in the body. However, it's important to note that this rule is more speculative than the first two, as there are many other factors that can contribute to the toxicity of a molecule.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to social circumstances based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a halogen atom such as chlorine (-Cl) in its structure, then it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" in the provided dataset. For example, the first molecule listed in the dataset contains a nitro group and is labeled as "0", indicating that it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a double bond between two carbon atoms, then it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. This rule also applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" in the provided dataset. For example, the third molecule listed in the dataset contains both a carbonyl group and a double bond between two carbon atoms, and is labeled as "0", indicating that it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom (-F) and a triple bond between two carbon atoms, then it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. This rule only applies to one molecule in the dataset, which is represented by the last SMILES string labeled as "1". Therefore, this rule cannot be generalized beyond this specific case.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its toxicity. The presence of this functional group in the molecule may disrupt normal cellular processes and lead to negative health outcomes. Therefore, molecules containing this group should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. Halogen atoms are known to be toxic and can interfere with normal biological functions. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should also be evaluated for their safety profile.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its reactivity. Nitro groups are highly reactive and can interact with other molecules in the body, leading to negative health outcomes. Therefore, molecules containing this group should also be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to social circumstances based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) in close proximity, then it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. The first example in the dataset satisfies this rule by having both groups connected through a five-membered ring.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a guanidine group (-NH-C(=NH2)-NH-) or a urea group (-NH-C(=O)-NH-), then it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. Both examples in the dataset contain these functional groups.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NR2), then it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. This is because sulfonamides are known to have antibacterial properties and some studies suggest they may also have mood-altering effects. The third example in the dataset contains such a group.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in social situations. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having side-effect activity related to social circumstances.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a quinolone ring system, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects. The second molecule in the dataset contains this structural feature and has also been labeled as having side-effect activity related to social circumstances.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains chlorine atoms, it may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects. The third molecule in the dataset contains two chlorine atoms and has been labeled as having no side-effect activity related to social circumstances. However, further research would need to be done to confirm these relationships.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of fluorine in a compound may increase its lipophilicity and enhance its ability to cross cell membranes, leading to potential toxicity or adverse effects. Therefore, compounds containing fluorine should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles.
Rule 2: Compounds with aromatic rings may have higher binding affinity towards biological targets due to π-π interactions between the ring system and amino acid residues within the active site. However, this property also increases the likelihood of toxic effects such as mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. Therefore, careful consideration must be given when designing molecules with aromatic rings.
Rule 3: Nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as pyridine, pyrimidine, and imidazole are commonly found in drugs and other biologically active compounds. While these moieties can confer useful properties such as hydrogen bonding capacity and increased solubility, they can also contribute to toxicity through mechanisms such as covalent modification of proteins or disruption of cellular redox balance. Therefore, careful evaluation of the structural features and pharmacokinetic profile of nitrogen-containing heterocycles is necessary before incorporating them into drug candidates.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, nitro, and halogen groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects due to their reactivity and ability to form covalent bonds with biological molecules. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles.
Rule 2: Compounds with aromatic rings or conjugated systems may also have increased toxicity due to their ability to interact with biological macromolecules through π-π stacking interactions or electron transfer reactions. These types of compounds should also be evaluated cautiously.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a compound's structure may also play a role in determining its potential for causing adverse effects. Longer chains and more complex structures may make it harder for the body to break down and eliminate the compound, leading to longer-lasting or more severe effects. Therefore, simpler compounds may be safer to use than more complex ones.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to social circumstances based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) or a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, then it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. The presence of these functional groups indicates that the molecule may interact with biological systems in ways that could lead to negative consequences for individuals experiencing certain social situations.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom (-F) attached to one of its aromatic rings, then it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. Fluorine is known to affect the electronic properties of molecules, which can impact their interactions with other molecules and biological systems. Therefore, the presence of this substituent suggests that the molecule may have unique chemical and physical properties that could contribute to negative outcomes under certain social conditions.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in its structure, then it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. Sulfonamides are a class of antibiotics that inhibit the growth of bacteria by blocking the production of folic acid, which is essential for cell division. However, some studies suggest that sulfonamides may also have negative effects on human behavior and mental health, particularly when taken in high doses or over long periods of time. Therefore, the presence of this functional group suggests that the molecule may have unintended consequences beyond its intended use as an antibiotic.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to social circumstances based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to molecules C1C(C(C(C(N1CCO)CO)O)O)O, CC1=C(C=C(C=C1)N2C(=O)C(=C(N2)C)N/N=C/3\C=CC=C(C3=O)C4=CC(=CC=C4)C(=O)O)C, CCC(=O)[C@]1([C@@H](CC2[C@@]1(C[C@@H](C3C2CCC4=CC(=O)C=C[C@]34C)O)C)C)C, CNCCCN1C2=CC=CC=C2CCC3=CC=CC=C31, COCCOC(=O)NCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)NCCCCCCCOP(=O)(C)O)NC(=O)OCCOC, and NC(=O)c1ccc(cc1Br)Oc1ccccc1.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom in the ring, then it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in certain social situations. The presence of this functional group is known to have antimicrobial properties, but it can also interact with other drugs or chemicals in the body, leading to unwanted side effects. Therefore, it is important to consider the context in which the molecule is being used when evaluating its safety profile.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its ability to bind to proteins and disrupt their function. This property makes cyanides useful as pesticides and herbicides, but they can also be toxic at high concentrations. It is important to carefully evaluate the dosage and exposure time when using such compounds.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects by interfering with cellular respiration and energy production. Chlorinated hydrocarbons like chloroform and dichloromethane are well-known examples of halogenated compounds that can cause toxicity through this mechanism. It is important to take precautions when handling these types of molecules and to avoid prolonged exposure whenever possible.

Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene or alkyne group (-C=C- or -C≡C-), then it may have side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to molecules in row 10 of the table.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a guanidine group (-CN2), then it may have side effects related to social circumstances. This rule applies to molecules in row 11 of the table.
Note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the given dataset and should be treated as preliminary until further validation is performed.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom, then it is likely to have side-effect activity associated with social circumstances (label 1). This rule applies to molecules in rows 1, 6, 7, 9, 18, and 20 of the table.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it is unlikely to have side-effect activity associated with social circumstances (label 0). This rule applies to molecules in rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 19 of the table.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have side-effect activity associated with social circumstances (label 1). This rule applies to molecules in row 15 of the table.
Note that these rules are just examples and should not be considered definitive. It's important to keep in mind that there may be other factors that contribute to a molecule's ability to cause adverse effects beyond its chemical structure.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a functional group called isocyanate (-N=C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its reactivity. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and is labeled as having a side-effect activity related to social circumstances.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a negatively charged ion such as phosphate or sulfate, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its ability to interact with other molecules in the body. The second molecule in the dataset contains two sodium ions (Na+) which make it highly polar and potentially reactive. It is labeled as not having any side-effect activity.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, such as in the third molecule in the dataset, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects due to its ability to absorb light energy and undergo chemical reactions. This molecule is labeled as not having any side-effect activity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to social circumstances based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) or a carbonyl group (-COR) in addition to a benzene ring, then it may have potential side effects related to social circumstances. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and have labels of 1, indicating they do have such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a nitrogen atom, then it may also have potential side effects related to social circumstances. The third molecule in the dataset contains this group and has a label of 1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds between carbon atoms, then it may also have potential side effects related to social circumstances. This includes both aromatic rings and non-aromatic systems. The fourth through seventh molecules in the dataset all contain such systems and have labels of 1.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) in the structure of a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects due to its ability to bind to proteins and disrupt their function. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.
Rule 2: Molecules containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine may also have the potential to cause adverse effects if they are present in high concentrations or are part of reactive chemical groups. These compounds can interact with other molecules and alter their biological activity.
Rule 3: The presence of certain structural features such as aromatic rings, conjugated double bonds, and charged ions may increase the reactivity of a molecule and make it more likely to cause adverse effects. However, these characteristics alone do not guarantee toxicity and must be considered in conjunction with other factors such as dose and exposure time.
