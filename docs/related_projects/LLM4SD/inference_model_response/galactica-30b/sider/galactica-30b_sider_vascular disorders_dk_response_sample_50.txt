Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The first example in the dataset contains a sulfonyl group and is labeled as having no such potential.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and a secondary amine group (NHCH2R), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The second example in the dataset contains both groups and is labeled as having no such potential.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) attached to a five-membered ring, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The third example in the dataset contains a chlorine atom attached to a thiazole ring and is labeled as having no such potential.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of negatively charged ions such as [Gd+3] in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on blood vessels. This rule applies specifically to compounds labeled with "1" in the dataset.
Rule 2: Compounds containing functional groups such as cyano (-CN) or nitro (-NO2) may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on blood vessels compared to those without these groups. This rule applies to several molecules labeled with "1" and one molecule labeled with "0".
Rule 3: Molecules with a high degree of symmetry or planarity may be less likely to cause adverse effects on blood vessels due to their stability and lower reactivity. This rule applies to two molecules labeled with "0" but does not apply to any molecules labeled with "1" in the dataset.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains iodine atoms, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The presence of iodine in molecules can increase their lipophilicity, which can lead to increased absorption into the bloodstream and potentially harmful interactions with other substances within the body.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains sulfur or selenium atoms, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. Sulfur and selenium are essential elements for many biological processes, so they are often incorporated into drugs and other biologically active compounds. However, excessive exposure to these elements can also be toxic, so it's important to use them judiciously.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains multiple conjugated double bonds, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. Conjugated double bonds can increase the molecule's ability to absorb light energy, which can lead to phototoxicity and other harmful reactions. Additionally, some studies suggest that certain types of conjugated double bonds may interact with proteins and other biomolecules in ways that can disrupt normal cellular functions.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like "CC(C)(C)NCC(C1=CC(=C(C=C1)O)CO)O" in the given SMILES string then it may lead to adverse effects on vascular disorders. This functional group contains two carbonyl groups which can interact with receptors and enzymes responsible for causing such diseases. Therefore, this rule suggests that molecules containing similar functional groups should be avoided or used cautiously if they have potential to cause adverse effects on vascular system.
Rule 2: The second rule states that if the given SMILES string has a structure like "CCN1C=C(C(=O)C2=CC(=C(C=C21)N3CCNCC3)F)C(=O)O", it also indicates the possibility of having adverse effects on vascular disorder due to its similarity with the previous functional group. However, further research needs to be conducted to confirm these findings as this particular structural feature has not been studied extensively yet.
Rule 3: The third rule highlights that if the given SMILES string includes a functional group like "CCCCCC(C=CC1C(CC(=O)C1CCCCCCC(=O)O)O)O", it could potentially cause adverse effects on cardiovascular systems because of the presence of multiple conjugated double bonds and hydroxyl groups. These features increase the likelihood of interacting with biological targets involved in various disease pathways. Hence, caution must be taken while using compounds possessing similar structures.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a compound increases its likelihood of causing vascular disorders as seen in compounds labeled 1 for CN1C(=O)N2C=NC(=C2N=N1)C(=O)N and C1=CC(=CC=C1NC(=NC(=NCCCCCCN=C(N)N=C(N)NC2=CC=C(C=C2)Cl)N)N)Cl.
Rule 2: Compounds containing a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) have been associated with increased risk of vascular disorders such as those found in compounds labeled 1 for CCC12CCC3C(C1CCC2(C#C)O)CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34 and CC1=CC(=CC(=C1NC2=NC(=NC=C2)NC3=CC=C(C=C3)C#N)C)C=CC#N.
Rule 3: A compound's ability to form hydrogen bonds may also play a role in its potential to cause vascular disorders. For example, compounds labeled 1 for COCC1=C(N2C(C(C2=O)NC(=O)C(=NOC)C3=CSC(=N3)N)SC1)C(=O)O and CCS(=O)(=O)O contain functional groups that can act as hydrogen bond acceptors while compounds labeled

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-COOH" in a compound may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects on blood vessels due to its ability to bind to proteins and disrupt their function. Therefore, compounds containing this functional group should be labeled as having a high risk of causing vascular disorders.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings such as benzene or pyridine have been shown to exhibit toxic effects on various organs including the liver, kidneys, and brain. Therefore, compounds containing these structures should also be considered as potentially harmful to blood vessels.
Rule 3: Molecules with a high degree of symmetry tend to have lower solubility in water compared to asymmetric molecules. This property could affect how easily they can cross cell membranes and interact with biological systems. Therefore, symmetric molecules may have a lower likelihood of causing adverse effects than asymmetric ones.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a benzene ring in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on vascular disorders. This rule can be inferred from the fact that two out of three molecules labeled as 1 contain a benzene ring.
Rule 2: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a compound also increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on vascular disorders. This rule can be inferred from the fact that all four molecules containing C=O groups are labeled as 1.
Rule 3: The absence of a hydroxyl group (OH) and the presence of a cyano group (CN) in a compound decreases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on vascular disorders. This rule can be inferred from the fact that one molecule labeled as 0 contains both OH and CN groups while another molecule labeled as 0 only contains CN but no other functional groups.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a barium ion (Ba+2) in its structure, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies only to the first SMILES string provided in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom (F) attached to a carbon atom in the cyclopropane ring, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies only to the second SMILES string provided in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom (N) bonded to two other carbon atoms, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to all molecules except for the third one where there is no such bond present.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having the potential to cause such effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. However, this rule should be used cautiously since there are other molecules in the dataset without this functional group but still labeled as potentially causing these effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl) attached to a carbon atom, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule is supported by the fact that two out of four molecules containing this functional group have been labeled as having the potential to cause such effects.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a sulfonamide group in the structure of a molecule, then it may have potential side effects on the cardiovascular system. The presence of this functional group can be identified by checking for the presence of the SMILES string "SO2NH" or "R-SO2NR'" where R and R' can be any organic substituent. For example, in the first SMILE string provided, the sulfonamide group is present as "SO2NS(=O)(=O)C3=CC=C(C=C3)N" which indicates its potential side effects on the cardiovascular system.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have potential side effects on the cardiovascular system. This functional group can be identified by checking for the presence of the SMILES string "NO2". For instance, in the second SMILE string provided, the nitro group is present as "NO2" which suggests its possible association with cardiovascular toxicity.
Rule 3: If a molecule has a high degree of aromaticity, then it may have potential side effects on the central nervous system. This property can be determined by counting the number of rings in the molecular structure using the SMILES notation. For example, in the third SMILE string provided, there are two benzene rings represented as "c1ccnc1" and "c1ccc(n2ccccc2)c1" respectively, indicating their potential neurotoxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a carbonyl group (C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5) or a naphthalene ring (C10H8), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to molecules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 2

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonyl group in a compound may indicate its potential to cause adverse effects on blood vessels. This rule can be applied to molecules such as CC(C)C1=C(C(=CC=C1)C(C)C)O and C1CNN(Cc2ccccc2Oc2cccnc2nccn2C#N)C1.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring may have the potential to cause adverse effects on blood vessels. This rule can be applied to molecules such as CCC(C)NCC(C1=CC(=CC(=C1)O)O)O and CN(C)CCCOC1=NN(C2=CC=CC=C21)CC3=CC=CC=C3.
Rule 3: A molecule containing a carboxylic acid group may also have the potential to cause adverse effects on blood vessels. This rule can be applied to molecules such as COOH and O=P(O)(OC1=CC=CC=C1FC(F)(F)F)OC(CF3)(F)F.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on blood vessels. This rule can be applied to compounds 7 and 8 as they both contain this functional group.
Rule 2: Compounds containing conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings have a higher chance of being toxic than those without them. Therefore, compounds 9 and 10 may have a greater risk of causing adverse effects due to their conjugation and planarity.
Rule 3: A compound's molecular weight and hydrophobicity may also play a role in determining its toxicity. Generally, larger molecules tend to be more hydrophobic and less water-soluble, which can make them more likely to interact with cell membranes and cause damage. Compound 1 has a relatively high molecular weight compared to other compounds listed here, making it potentially more harmful.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to vascular disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a benzene ring, then it may have side effects related to vascular disorders. The first example in the dataset meets this criteria, as it contains both a sulfonamide group and a benzene ring.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a pyridine ring, then it may have side effects related to vascular disorders. The second example in the dataset meets this criteria, as it contains both a nitro group and a pyridine ring.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a pyrimidine ring, then it may have side effects related to vascular disorders. The third example in the dataset meets this criteria, as it contains both a carbonyl group and a pyrimidine ring.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NR2) and a benzene ring, then it may have side effects related to vascular disorders. The given SMILES string for this property is C[C@@H]1C2C(C(=O)N2C(=C1S[C@H]3C[C@H](NC3)C(=O)N(C)C)C(=O)O)[C@H](C)O.O.O.O 1. This rule suggests that molecules containing these functional groups should be carefully evaluated for their potential side effects on blood vessels.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure has a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom in a five-membered ring, then it may not have any side effects related to vascular disorders. The given SMILES strings for this property are COCCCN1CCC(CC1)NC(=O)C2=CC(=C(C3=C2OCC3)N)Cl 0 and CC1=CC(=C(N1)C=C2C3=CC=CC=C3NC2=O)C 1. This rule suggests that if there is no such substitution present in the molecule, then it may not have any significant impact on its biological activities or side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a cyano group (-CN) and a conjugated system of double bonds, then it may have side effects related to vascular disorders. The given SMILES strings for this property are CN1C(CNC2=

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group C=ONC in the molecular structure may indicate potential vascular disorder side effects. This functional group is present in molecules labeled as 1 and absent in those labeled as 0.
Rule 2: The absence of the functional group CC(C) in the molecular structure may also suggest potential vascular disorder side effects. This functional group is only found in one molecule labeled as 0 out of all the molecules listed.
Rule 3: The presence of the functional group COC(NH2)SC in the molecular structure suggests that the molecule may have no potential for causing vascular disorder side effects. This functional group is only found in two molecules labeled as 0 out of all the molecules listed.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a bromine atom in the molecular structure may indicate potential side effects associated with vascular disorders. This rule applies to the first SMILES string provided where the presence of bromine indicates possible toxicity and should be further investigated for its potential impact on human health.
Rule 2: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in the molecular structure may increase the risk of adverse reactions such as allergic reactions or skin irritation. This rule applies to the second SMILES string provided where the sulfonamide group is present and may require additional monitoring during drug administration.
Rule 3: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecular structure may also increase the risk of adverse reactions such as methemoglobinemia or hemolytic anemia. This rule applies to the third SMILES string provided where the nitro group is present and may warrant closer monitoring during drug administration.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and is labeled as having the potential to cause such effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The second molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and is labeled as having the potential to cause such effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. None of the molecules in the dataset contain this functional group but all of them are labeled as either having or not having the potential to cause such effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the first molecule listed in the dataset contains a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring and is labeled as "1" because it is known to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) attached to an aromatic ring or an aliphatic chain, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" in the dataset. For example, the second molecule listed in the dataset contains a sulfonyl group attached to an aromatic ring and is labeled as "0" because it is not known to cause any adverse effects related to vascular disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) adjacent to a nitrogen atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "1" in the dataset. For example, the third molecule listed in the dataset contains a carbonyl group adjacent to a nitrogen atom and is labeled as "1" because it is known to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on blood vessels.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to negative consequences. For example, the sulfonyl group present in the first SMILES string has been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular events due to its ability to block potassium channels in the heart muscle.
Rule 2: A compound containing metal ions such as lanthanum or magnesium may also exhibit adverse effects on blood vessels.
Explanation: Metal ions can interfere with various biochemical processes and alter the structure and function of proteins involved in maintaining healthy blood vessels. For instance, lanthanum ions have been shown to inhibit calcium-activated potassium channels, which play a critical role in regulating vasodilation and vasoconstriction.
Rule 3: Compounds containing heterocyclic rings such as furan, thiophene, and pyridine may pose a higher risk of inducing adverse effects on blood vessels compared to those without these structures.
Explanation: Heterocyclic rings are known to possess unique chemical and physical properties that make them more reactive than other types of compounds. They can interact with biological macromolecules and disrupt their normal functioning, leading to harmful consequences. For example, the fifth SMILES string contains a furan ring that has been associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which are implicated in the development of cardiovascular diseases.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like "-COOH" or "-CONH2" in the structure of a molecule, then it has high probability of causing adverse effects on vascular system.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to bind to receptors and enzymes present in blood vessels which can lead to vasoconstriction or vasodilation resulting in hypertension or hypotension respectively.
Rule 2: If there is a presence of aromatic ring in the structure of a molecule, then it may also contribute towards adverse effects on vascular system due to its hydrophobic nature.
Explanation: Aromatic rings can interact with proteins and enzymes leading to changes in their function and structure which can result in various cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, thrombosis etc.
Rule 3: If there is a presence of nitro group (-NO2) in the structure of a molecule, then it has high probability of causing adverse effects on respiratory system due to its irritant and toxic nature.
Explanation: Nitro group can react with oxygen molecules forming reactive nitrogen species which can damage cells and tissues in lungs leading to asthma, bronchitis, emphysema etc.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom bonded to two carbon atoms in a conjugated system, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule and has been labeled as having the potential to cause such effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a double bond in a conjugated system, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The third molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule and has also been labeled as having the potential to cause such effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbonyl group and a sulfonamide group, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The sixth molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule and has also been labeled as having the potential to cause such effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the cyano group (-CN) present in the first SMILES string could be associated with toxicity. Similarly, the sulfonyl group (-SO2R) found in the second SMILES string has been linked to allergic reactions and other adverse effects. Therefore, molecules containing these or similar functional groups should be carefully evaluated for potential risks.
Rule 2: The structure of a molecule can also play a role in determining its safety profile. For instance, the third SMILES string contains a nitro group (-NO2) which is known to be toxic and potentially carcinogenic. Additionally, the fourth SMILES string features a carbamate group (-OC(=O)NR1R2) which can undergo hydrolysis under physiological conditions to release toxic compounds such as carbon dioxide and amines. Therefore, molecules containing these or similar structural motifs should be closely monitored for potential hazards.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound can also affect its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets. Molecules with high molecular weights and hydrophobicities tend to have lower bioavailability and higher toxicity than more hydrophilic and smaller molecules. Therefore, these factors should be taken into account when evaluating the safety of new chemical entities.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to vascular disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and are labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a metal ion such as strontium or barium, then it may also have potential side effects related to vascular disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains both strontium ions and is labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a conjugated system consisting of alternating single and double bonds, then it may also have potential side effects related to vascular disorders. This is because conjugation can increase the stability of the molecule and make it more reactive, which could lead to unwanted interactions with other molecules in the body. The fifth molecule in the dataset contains a benzene ring, which is a common example of a conjugated system, and is labeled as having such side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a gadolinium ion ([Gd+3]) or a barium ion ([Ba+2]), then it is likely to have adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule is based on the fact that these ions are known to cause vascular disorders in some cases.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to two carbon atoms in a linear arrangement, as in CCC(=C)C(=O)C1=C(C(=C(C=C1)OCC(=O)O)Cl)Cl, then it is unlikely to have adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule is based on the observation that this specific structural feature appears only in molecules labeled as having no such effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a benzene ring, as in C6H5CONHC(NH2)CH3, then it is likely to have adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule is based on the fact that nitro groups are known to cause blood vessel constriction and other vascular problems.

================================

Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to molecules such as N, C1=C(NC=N1)CCN, CCC(=O)O, and CCS(=O)(=O)CCS(=O)(=O)CCON1CCOCC1
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to a phenyl ring (-C6H5), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular

================================

Rule 1: The presence of sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) in a molecule may increase its potential to cause vascular disorders as seen in the first and third molecules labeled as 1. This rule should be applied cautiously since other factors such as dosage, duration of use, and individual susceptibility also play a role in determining the likelihood of developing adverse effects.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring may have a higher risk of causing adverse effects on blood vessels as observed in the second molecule labeled as 1. However, this rule needs further validation due to limited data available.
Rule 3: A molecule having a polar functional group like carboxylic acid or amide may exhibit better aqueous solubility which could lead to increased absorption into the bloodstream and potentially cause adverse effects on blood vessels as shown by the fourth molecule labeled as 1. It is important to note that these rules are based on general trends and may not apply to all cases. Further research and analysis are needed to establish more specific structure-activity relationships for predicting adverse drug reactions.

================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three possible rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure:

Rule 2: A carbonyl group (C=O) present in a compound may also increase the risk of causing adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. This rule applies to molecules such as [CH2]CC=O and CCC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(C)C(=O)O.
Rule 3: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) or other electron-withdrawing groups in a compound may decrease its ability to cross cell membranes and reach target sites within the body. This rule applies to molecules such as C1C(C(C(C(C1N)OC2C(C(C(C(O2)CO)O)N)O)O)OC3C(CC(C(O3)CN)O)N)N and CC1C(C(C(O1)OC2C(C(C(C(C2O)O)N=C(N)N)O)N=C(N)N)OC3C(C(C(C(O3)CO)O)O)NC)(C=O)O.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The presence of this functional group in certain drugs such as glibenclamide and tolbutamide has been linked to their ability to block ATP-sensitive potassium channels in pancreatic beta cells, leading to insulin secretion and hypoglycemia. However, this rule should be taken with caution since other factors such as dosage, duration of use, and individual patient characteristics also play a role in determining the overall toxicity of a drug.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. Nitro compounds such as nitroglycerin and isosorbide dinitrate are commonly used for treating angina pectoris and heart failure due to their vasodilatory effects on blood vessels. However, these agents can also cause hypotension, headache, and other side effects at higher doses or in susceptible individuals.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. Halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane and chloroform are known to cause central nervous system depression, respiratory depression, and cardiac arrhythmias when inhaled or ingested. These agents can also cause liver damage and other systemic toxicities at high doses.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a nitrate ion (NO3-), then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in relation to vascular disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1C(C2C(O1)C(CO2)O[N+](=O)[O-])O[N+](=O)[O-] and CCOC1=C(C=CC(=C1)CC(=O)NC(CC(C)C)C2=CC=CC=C2N3CCCCC3)C(=O)O.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have a low probability of causing adverse effects in relation to vascular disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCCN1CCN(CC1)CCCN2C3=CC=CC=C3SC4=C2C=C(C=C4)C(F)(F)F and CN(C)CCC1=CNC2=C1C=C(C=C2)CN3C=NC=N3.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), then it may have a moderate probability of causing adverse effects in relation to vascular

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to molecules in rows 2, 9, and 10 of the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to molecules in row 3 of the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a fluorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to molecules in rows 4 and 5 of the dataset.
Note that these rules are just examples and should not be used as the only criteria for predicting adverse effects. It is important to consider other factors such as dosage, duration of use, and individual patient characteristics when evaluating the safety of a drug.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (represented by the SMILES string C1=CC=C(C=C1)C2(C(=O)N(C(=O)N2)COP(=O)([O-])[O-])C3=CC=CC=C3.[Na+].[Na+] 1) or a pyridine ring (represented by the SMILES string C1CN=C(N1)CC2=CC=CC3=CC=CC=C32 1), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a furan ring (represented by the SMILES string CC1(C2C(C3C(C(=O)C(=C(N)[O-])C(=O)C3(C(=O)C2=C(C4=C1C=CC=C4O)O)O)N(C)C)O)O.CC1(C2C(C3C(C(=O)C(=C(N)[O-])C(=O)C3(C(=O)C2=C(C4=C1C=CC=C4O)O)O)N(C)C)O)O.[Ca+2] 0) or a thiophene ring (represented by the SMILES string CCC1=NC(=C(N1CC2=CC=C(C=C2)

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The presence of these functional groups indicates that the molecule may interact with proteins in the body, which could lead to negative health outcomes.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. Nitro compounds are known to be toxic and can cause damage to blood vessels.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. Halogen atoms can affect the chemical and physical properties of molecules, including their reactivity and solubility. This can potentially increase the likelihood of interactions between the molecule and biological systems, leading to negative health outcomes.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a similar functional group, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the dataset. For example, the first molecule in the list contains a sulfonamide group and is labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 0 in the dataset. For example, the second molecule in the list contains a nitro group and is labeled as 0.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as either 1 or 0 in the dataset. For example, the third molecule in the list contains a benzene ring and is labeled as 1.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of the functional group "-COOH" in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on vascular disorders. The SMILES string for this rule would be "CC1([C@@H](N2[C@H](S1)[C@@H](C2=O)NC(=O)CC3=CC=CC=C3)C(=O)O)C.CC1([C@@H](N2[C@H](S1)[C@@H](C2=O)NC(=O)CC3=CC=CC=C3)C(=O)O)C.C1=CC=C(C=C1)CNCCNCC2=CC=CC=C2 1 COC1=CC=CC=C1OCC(COC(=O)N)O CCNC(=O)C1CCCN1C(=O)C(CCCN=C(N)N)NC(=O)C(CC(C)C)NC(=O)C(CC(C)C)NC(=O)C(CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)NC(=O)C(CO)NC(=O)C(CC3=CNC4=CC=CC=C43)NC(=O)C(CC

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The first molecule in the dataset contains a sulfonyl group and is labeled as having a side-effect activity related to vascular disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The second molecule in the dataset contains a nitro group and is labeled as having a side-effect activity related to vascular disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to an aromatic ring, it may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains such a moiety and is labeled as having a side-effect activity related to vascular disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a benzene ring in a compound increases its likelihood of causing vascular disorders as seen in compounds labeled 1 for CC12CCC3C(C1CCC2(C)O)CCC4C3(CC(=CO)C(=O)C4)C and C1=CC=C(C=C1)CC(C(=O)O)O. However, this rule alone may not be sufficient since other factors such as functional groups and molecular weight also play a role in determining toxicity.
Rule 2: Compounds containing a nitro group (-NO2) have been shown to exhibit toxic effects on the cardiovascular system as seen in CN1C2CCC1CC(C2)OC(=O)C3=CNC4=CC=CC=C43. This suggests that the presence of a strong electron-withdrawing group like -NO2 can increase the reactivity of a compound and potentially lead to adverse effects.
Rule 3: A compound's molecular weight and hydrophobicity can affect its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets. For example, molecules with high molecular weights and low water solubility tend to accumulate in tissues and organs, leading to chronic exposure and potential toxicity. This is evident in CCCONC(=O)NC1=C(C=C(C=C1)NCC2=CC=C(C=C2)F)N where the large hydrophobic portion of the molecule likely contributes to its adverse effects on the cardiovascular system.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains at least one of the following functional groups or substructures:
- Carbonyl group (C=O)
- Anionic oxygen atoms in the form of oxide ions (O^-)
- Two or more anionic oxygen atoms in close proximity
- Lanthanum or other metal cations
Then it is likely to have side-effect activity related to vascular disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a substituted indole ring (a six-membered aromatic ring with a nitrogen atom and one or more substituent groups attached to it), then it is also likely to have side-effect activity related to vascular disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a chlorinated acetyl group (CH3C(=O)Cl), then it may have side-effect activity related to vascular disorders. However, this rule should be used cautiously as there may be exceptions.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The first molecule in the dataset contains a sulfonamide group and has been labeled as having no such potential. Therefore, this rule would need to be further tested using more molecules containing sulfonamide groups before being considered definitive.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The second molecule in the dataset contains a nitro group and has been labeled as having no such potential. However, since only one example is available, this rule should also be further tested using more examples.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) connected to an aliphatic chain, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains a carboxylic acid group and has been labeled as having no such potential. Again, this rule should be further tested using more examples.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a bromine atom and a nitro group, then it is likely to have side-effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to the second SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a cyano group and a carbonyl group, then it is also likely to have side-effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to the third SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 1.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a phosphorus atom bonded to two oxygen atoms and one carbon atom, and at least one of these bonds is a double bond, then it is highly likely to have side-effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to the fourth SMILES string in the dataset labeled as 1.
It's important to note that these rules are just educated guesses based on the limited information provided by the dataset. Further research and analysis would be needed to confirm their validity and applicability to other molecules.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of chlorine atom in the structure of the molecule, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The first molecule in the given dataset satisfies this rule and has been labeled as having a side-effect activity related to vascular disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group, then it may have a higher chance of causing adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The third molecule in the given dataset satisfies this rule but has been labeled as not having any such side-effects. This suggests that other factors also play a role in determining the likelihood of a molecule causing these types of side-effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group, then it may have a lower chance of causing adverse effects related to vascular disorders. The second molecule in the given dataset does not contain a nitro group but has been labeled as having no side-effects related to vascular disorders. However, further research would be needed to confirm if this rule holds true for all molecules containing nitro groups.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a compound may indicate potential adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. This rule applies to molecules such as C[C@@H]1C2C(C(=O)N2C(=C1S[C@H]3C[C@H](NC3)C(=O)N(C)C)C(=O)O)[C@H](C)O.O.O.O and CC[C@@]1(C[C@H]2C[C@@](C3=C(CCN(C2)C1)C4=CC=CC=C4N3)(C5=C(C=C6C(=C5)[C@]78CCN9[C@H]7[C@@](C=CC9)([C@H]([C@@]([C@@H]8N6C)(C(=O)OC)O)OC(=O)C)CC)OC)C(=O)OC)O.
Rule 2: A nitro group (-NO2) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. This rule applies to molecules such as OP(=O)([O-])[O-].[K+].[K+] and [N]=O.
Rule 3: The presence of a guanidine group (-NH-C(=NH)-NH-) in a compound may also increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. This rule applies to molecules such as CCC[C@@H](C

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to molecules 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrile group (-CN), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular

================================

Rule 1: The presence of specific functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) or a carbonyl group (>C=O) in a molecule may increase its potential for causing vascular disorders. Therefore, molecules containing these functional groups should be given higher priority when screening for potential adverse effects.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule may also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects. Molecules that are too large or have a non-optimal shape may be less likely to cross cell membranes and interact with target proteins. Therefore, molecules that are smaller and more compact may be more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of certain atoms or bonds in a molecule may also affect its ability to cause adverse effects. For example, the presence of multiple halogen atoms (such as chlorine or fluorine) in a molecule may increase its hydrophobicity and make it more likely to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues such as the blood vessels. Similarly, the presence of conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings in a molecule may increase its stability and enhance its ability to interact with biological targets.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) or a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), then it may have potential side effects related to vascular disorders. The presence of these functional groups indicates that the molecule may interact with proteins in the body, which could lead to negative health outcomes.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have potential side effects related to vascular disorders. Nitro compounds can irritate the skin and mucous membranes, and they can also cause methemoglobinemia, a condition where the body's ability to carry oxygen is impaired.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (-C6H5), then it may also have potential side effects related to vascular disorders. Benzene is a known carcinogen, meaning it can cause cancer, and it can also affect blood clotting and other aspects of the immune system.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a negatively charged oxygen atom bonded to two carbon atoms in a carbonyl group (represented by the SMILES string CC(=O)[O-]), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule is based on the fact that certain types of molecules containing this functional group have been shown to have vasoconstrictive or vasodilatory effects, which can affect blood pressure and other cardiovascular parameters.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (represented by the SMILES string CNC(=O)C1=NC=CC(=C1)OC2=CC=C(C=C2)NC(=O)NC3=CC(=C(C=C3)Cl)C(F)(F)F), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to vascular disorders. This rule is based on the fact that nitro compounds can interact with various biological targets and have a range of pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and vasodilatory effects.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitrile group (represented by the SMILES string CCC(C)CCCCC(=O)NC(CCN)C(=O)NC(C(C)O)C(=O)NC(CCN)C(=O)NC1CCNC
