Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a conjugated system between two double bonds or triple bonds separated by one carbon atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C1=CC(=CN=C1)C(=O)[O-] 1 and CCN(C1=CC=CC(=C1)C2=CC=NC3=C(C=NN23)C#N)C(=O)C 1 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected through a nitrogen atom, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES string CON=C(C1=CSC(=N1)N)C(=O)NC2C3N(C2=O)C(=CCS3)C(=O)O 0 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a cyclopropane ring and a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to the ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES string CCC(C)OOCC(C)(C)Oc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 1 in the dataset.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings C(CNCCNCCN)N and CS(=O)(=O)C1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=C(C(=O)OC2)C3=CC=CC=C3.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a quinolone ring system, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CC1CC(=O)NC(=O)C1N2C(=O)C3=CC=CC=C3C2=O and CCC[C@@H](C(=O)OCC)N[C@H](C)C(=O)N1[C@H]2CCCC[C@H]2C[C@H]1C(=O)O.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a conjugated double bond system, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule applies to molecules

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the liver or other organs. Therefore, compounds containing these functional groups should be labeled as having high risk of causing hepatotoxicity.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds may have higher probability of being toxic due to their ability to interact with biological molecules through π-π stacking interactions. Therefore, compounds containing these structural features should also be labeled as having high risk of causing toxicity.
Rule 3: Compounds containing metal ions such as sodium, manganese, calcium, lanthanum, or iron may exhibit different chemical reactivity compared to organic compounds without metals. Therefore, the presence of metal ions in a compound may affect its potential for causing adverse effects. However, further research is needed to establish specific structure-activity relationships between metal ion content and toxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom and a conjugated system consisting of alternating single and double bonds, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings "CC(=O)CCC1=CC2=C(C=C1)C=C(C=C2)OC" and "C1=CC(=C(C=C1Cl)Cl)COC(CN2C=CN=C2)C3=C(C=C(C=C3)Cl)Cl".
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms in a ring structure, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings "C1C2CNCC1C3=CC4=NC=CN=C4C=C23" and "CCONC(=O)c1ccc(cc1)Nc1cccc(n1)Oc1ccc(nc2nnc3ccccc3s2)cc1".
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a carboxylic acid group attached to a phenyl ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings "[H+].[H+].CCOC1=CC=C(C=C1)C[C@H](CN(CCN(CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])N(CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-].[Gd+3]" and "CC(=O)CCC1=CC2=C(C=C1)C=C(C=C2)OC".

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a five-membered ring with two nitrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in relation to hepatobiliary disorders. The first molecule in the given dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a five-membered ring with two nitrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Therefore, we can assign the label "1" for this molecule indicating its potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a six-membered ring with alternating carbon and nitrogen atoms, then it may have a low probability of causing adverse effects in relation to hepatobiliary disorders. The second molecule in the given dataset satisfies this rule but does not contain any oxygen atoms. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive prediction about its potential to cause adverse effects based on this rule alone. We need more information or analysis to determine if this molecule should be labeled as "1" or "0".
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring with a sulfonyl group attached to it, then it has a moderate probability of causing adverse effects in relation to hepatobiliary disorders. The fourth molecule in the given dataset satisfies this rule and also contains a chlorine atom which may increase its toxicity. Therefore, we can assign the label "1" for this molecule indicating its potential to cause adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, then it may have potential side effects on liver function. The given SMILES string for CCC(=O)OC(C(C)C)OP(=O)(CCCCC1=CC=CC=C1)CC(=O)N2CC(CC2C(=O)[O-])C3CCCCC3 does contain both these groups, so it should be labeled as having potential side effects on liver function.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a guanidine group (-C(=NH2)NR2R3) and a chlorinated carbohydrate moiety (-CHClO-), then it may also have potential side effects on liver function. The given SMILES string C=CCN.C1C(O1)CCl does contain both these groups, so it should also be labeled as having potential side effects on liver function.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a benzimidazole ring and a sulfonamide group, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The first example in the dataset meets this rule.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The second example in the dataset meets this rule.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. However, it's important to note that this rule should only be used as a general guideline and not as a definitive predictor. The third example in the dataset meets this rule but does not necessarily indicate that the molecule will cause adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as a carboxylic acid or its derivatives, it may lead to hepatotoxicity and other liver-related issues. The presence of these groups increases the likelihood of causing adverse effects in the body. For example, molecules like "CC1=C(C(=O)N2CCCCC2=N1)CCN3CCC(CC3)C4=NOC5=C4C=CC(=C5)F 1" contain a carboxylic acid group which may contribute to their toxicity.
Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic rings may also increase the risk of adverse effects due to their ability to interact with biological systems. For instance, molecules like "C1=CC=C(C=C1)COC2=CC=C(C=C2)O 0" have two benzene rings which may affect their pharmacokinetic profile.
Rule 3: A molecule's size and shape may play a role in determining its potential for adverse effects. Large and complex structures may be more likely to interact with biological targets and disrupt normal cellular processes. For example, molecules like "CCCC1OC2CC3C4CCC5=CC(=O)C=CC5(C4C(CC3(C2(O1)C(=O)CO)C)O)C 0" have a large and complex structure which may make them more toxic than smaller molecules.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a bromine atom and a benzene ring, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in relation to hepatobiliary disorders. The presence of these two features together may increase the likelihood of the compound interacting with biological molecules or disrupting normal cellular processes.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a carboxylic acid group attached to a carbon chain, then it has a low probability of causing adverse effects in relation to hepatobiliary disorders. Carboxylic acids are commonly found in natural products and are often considered safe for human consumption.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group, then it has a moderate probability of causing adverse effects in relation to hepatobiliary disorders. Sulfonamides are known to have adverse effects on the liver and other organs, but their exact mechanisms of action are not fully understood.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The first example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains both groups.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a guanidine group (-C(NH2)=NNHC(=O)) or a urea group (-CONH-CO-) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The second example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a guanidine group.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) in its structure, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to hepatobiliary disorders. The third example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a nitro group.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and a benzene ring, then it has a high probability of causing hepatobiliary disorders as indicated by the first SMILES string labeled as 1 in the given dataset. This rule suggests that molecules containing these functional groups may have a higher likelihood of exhibiting this type of toxicity.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a furan ring and a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it also has a high probability of causing hepatobiliary disorders as shown by the second SMILES string labeled as 1 in the dataset. This rule suggests that molecules containing these structural features may be more likely to exhibit this type of toxicity.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a nitrogen atom, then it does not have a high probability of causing hepatobiliary disorders as demonstrated by the third SMILES string labeled as 0 in the dataset. This rule suggests that molecules without this specific structural feature may be less likely to exhibit this type of toxicity.

Note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the given dataset, and should be treated as preliminary until further validated by additional experimental evidence.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as halogen atoms and nitro groups in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the liver or other organs. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, CON=C1CN(CC1CN)C2=C(C=C3C(=O)C(=CN(C3=N2)C4CC4)C(=O)O)F 1 contains a fluorine atom which may contribute to its hepatobiliary disorder activity.
Rule 2: The presence of certain structural features such as conjugated double bonds and aromatic rings in a molecule may also increase its potential for causing adverse effects.
