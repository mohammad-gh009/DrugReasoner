Rule 1: If the molecular formula contains sulfur, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in musculoskeletal and connective tissues. The presence of sodium ions also increases the likelihood of such effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a benzene ring or other aromatic rings, it may have a higher chance of causing adverse effects on these tissues.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a functional group like -COOH, -OH, or -NH2, it may increase its ability to bind to receptors in muscles and joints, leading to adverse effects. However, this rule should be used cautiously as some molecules containing these groups may still be safe for use.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. The presence of these groups in a drug molecule can increase its ability to bind to proteins, which can lead to unwanted interactions within the body.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F) attached to a benzene ring, then it may not be associated with any significant risk for causing adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. Halogen atoms are often used in medicinal chemistry to modify the physical and chemical properties of drugs without significantly altering their biological activities.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an aromatic ring, then it may potentially cause adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. Conjugation between the carbonyl group and the aromatic ring increases the reactivity of the compound, making it more susceptible to metabolic reactions and degradation. This can result in increased exposure to the compound's toxic metabolites and possible adverse effects.

Rule 2: If there is a presence of nitro group in the structure of a molecule, then it may have potential side effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. However, none of the given SMILES strings contain a nitro group. Therefore, we cannot make any prediction based on this rule for these molecules. We need more information about their structures.
Rule 3: If there is a presence of a benzene ring in the structure of a molecule, then it may have potential side effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. The given SMILES string contains a benzene ring which matches this rule. Therefore, we can assign label 1 to this SMILES string.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as "-COOH" or "-CONH-", then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This rule is based on the fact that these functional groups are commonly found in drugs that are known to cause such adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a bromine atom, it is likely to have side-effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. The presence of bromine indicates that the molecule may interact with biological systems in ways that could lead to these types of adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (represented by the symbol C=O), it is also likely to have side-effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. Carbonyl groups can participate in chemical reactions that can affect the function of proteins and other molecules within cells, which could lead to negative consequences for tissues and organs throughout the body.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (represented by the symbol NO2), it is less likely to have side-effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. Nitro groups are often associated with toxic or carcinogenic properties, so their presence in a molecule may indicate that it has more severe negative impacts on biological systems than those related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. For example, the presence of a sulfonamide group in the first SMILES string suggests potential toxicity towards these tissues.
Rule 2: The length and complexity of a molecule may also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects. For instance, the second SMILES string contains a long chain of carbon atoms that may affect its bioavailability or metabolism.
Rule 3: The specific arrangement of atoms within a molecule may be important for predicting its biological activity. For example, the third SMILES string contains several rings and double bonds that may contribute to its stability and reactivity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:

Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a similar functional group, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules #10, #11, #12, and #13.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring or a similar aromatic system, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules #14, #15, #16, and #18.

Rule 2: If there is a presence of Nitrogen atoms in the structure along with other functional groups like carbonyl group or double bonds, then it may also lead to Adverse Effects on Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders. The second SMILE string has both nitrogen and carbonyl group present which matches this rule.
Rule 3: If there is a presence of aromatic rings in the structure, then it may have some potential for causing adverse effects but it cannot be solely relied upon as it depends on various factors such as size, shape, charge distribution etc. The third SMILE string has an aromatic ring present which does not match any of these two rules.

Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group like "C1=C(N=C(S1)N=C(N)N)CSCCC(=NS(=O)(=O)N)N", it may be associated with adverse reactions.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure has a carbonyl group like "CC1(CC(=O)N(C1=O)C)C2=CC=CC=C2" or "CC1=CN(C(=O)C=C1)C2=CC=CC=C2", it may also lead to negative health outcomes.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of functional groups such as -COOH or -OH in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) or a carbonyl group (-COR), then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. The presence of these functional groups may increase the affinity for receptors involved in muscle contraction or collagen synthesis, leading to unwanted reactions.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom, then it has a low probability of causing adverse effects in musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. Chlorine atoms are often used as synthetic intermediates due to their reactivity, but they do not seem to have any specific association with this type of disorder.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom at position 9 of the indole ring system, then it has a moderate probability of causing adverse effects in musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. Fluorine is known to enhance biological activity by increasing lipophilicity and improving membrane permeability, which could lead to increased interactions with target proteins. However, further research would be needed to confirm this hypothesis.

Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This rule is based on the fact that many drugs containing Cl atoms have been associated with adverse reactions in these tissues.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonate group (-SO3-) or a zinc ion (Zn+2), then it is unlikely to have any adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl) bonded to a nitrogen atom (N) at position 1, then it may have some potential to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) connected to two aromatic rings, then it may have some potential to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a compound may indicate potential toxicity or adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 for which the structure contains at least one carbon-oxygen double bond. For example, the first compound listed has a carbonyl group attached to a long chain of carbons, which could potentially disrupt normal cell function if the compound were to interact with proteins involved in muscle or bone development.
Rule 2: The presence of a heterocyclic ring structure containing nitrogen atoms may also increase the likelihood of adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 for which the structure contains at least one five-membered ring with one or more nitrogen atoms. For example, the fourth compound listed has a pyrimidine ring structure, which is a type of heterocyclic ring commonly found in DNA and RNA molecules. Nitrogen atoms in this ring structure have a partial positive charge, which could potentially interact with negatively charged amino acid residues in proteins involved in muscle or bone development.
Rule 3: Compounds with a sulfonamide functional group (R-SO2NH2) may be associated with adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues. This rule applies to compounds represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 for which the structure contains a sulfur atom bonded to two oxygen atoms and one nitrogen atom. Sulfonamides are a class of antibiotics that inhibit the growth of bacteria by blocking the production of folic acid, which is essential for cell division. However, some studies suggest that sulfonamides may also affect the formation of cartilage and bone in developing embryos, leading to

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure "CC[C@H](C)[C@H]1C(=O)NC(C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@@H](CSSCCC(=O)N[C@@H](C(=O)N1)CC2=CC=C(C=C2)OCC)C(=O)N3CCC[C@H]3C(=O)N[C@@H](CCCN)C(=O)NCC(=O)N)CC(=O)N)[C@@H](C)O" then it is likely to have side-effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This rule was derived from the first SMILES string provided which contains this specific substructure and has been labeled as having such side-effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the functional group "C(C(C(=O)[O-])[S-])C(=O)[O-].[Na+].[Na+].[Au+]" then it is unlikely to have side-effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This rule was derived from the second SMILES string provided which does not contain any substructures or functional groups associated with these

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) or a carbonyl group (C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 in the dataset. For example, the first molecule in the dataset contains both a sulfonyl group and a carbonyl group, which suggests that it may have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring (C6H5) or a naphthalene ring (C10H8), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 0 in the dataset. For example, the third molecule in the dataset contains a benzene ring, which suggests that it does not have the potential to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. However, this rule should be used cautiously because some molecules containing nitro groups may still be safe for use. This rule applies to molecules labeled as either 1 or 0 in the dataset. For example, the sixth molecule in the dataset contains a nitro group, which suggests that it may have the potential to cause adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfhydryl group in a compound may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues. This rule applies to the first SMILE string provided where the sulfur atom is present as part of a thiol group (-SH).
Rule 2: A compound containing a conjugated system of double bonds or aromatic rings may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on these tissues. This rule applies to the second SMILE string provided which contains two phenyl groups connected by a triple bond.
Rule 3: A compound containing a carbonyl group (C=O) may be associated with increased risk of adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues. This rule applies to the third SMILE string provided where there is a ketone functional group (-C(=O)-) present.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of iodine atoms in the molecular structure may indicate potential adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) may have potential adverse effects on these tissues.
Rule 3: A molecule having a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring may also be associated with such adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to zinc, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. The presence of this specific functional group suggests that the molecule may interact with biological systems in ways that could lead to negative outcomes. However, this rule should be taken as a starting point only, and further research would need to be conducted to confirm its validity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This functional group is often associated with toxic or carcinogenic properties, which could explain why it appears in molecules that are known to cause harm. Again, this rule should be considered preliminary until confirmed by additional research.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. Sulfonamides are a class of antibiotics that are commonly prescribed for bacterial infections, but they can also have side effects such as joint pain and inflammation. While this rule is based on a well-established relationship between sulfonamide use and adverse effects, it should still be treated as tentative until verified through further study.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a benzene ring or a heterocyclic ring system, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules such as C1=CC(=C(C=C1OC2=C(C=C(C=C2I)CC(C(=O)O)N)I)I)O, CC(C)[N+]1(C2CCC1CC(C2)OC(=O)C(CO)C3=CC=CC=C3)C, CN1CCN(CC1)CCCN2C3=CC=CC=C3SC4=C2C=C(C=C4)Cl, CCC(CO)NCCNC(CC)CO, and COC2=CC=C(C=C2)O.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules such as F, Cl, Br, I, OCF3, OCBr3, IC6H5, CF3, CCl3, CHCl3, and CDCl3.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group or its derivatives, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects. This rule applies to molecules such as C1=CC(=

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of Gd+3 in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains fluorine atoms, then it may increase the risk of causing adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure has a functional group such as C=C or COOH, then it may decrease the likelihood of causing adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) in a molecule may indicate potential adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules such as CC(CN1C2=CC=CC=C2CCC3=CC=CC=C31)CN(C)C and CCC(CC)OC1C=C(CC(C1NC(=O)C)N)C(=O)OCC.
Rule 2: A molecule containing a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) may have potential adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules such as C1C(C1N)C2=CC=CC=C2 1 and CNC(=O)C1=NC=CC(=C1)OC2=CC=C(C=C2)NC(=O)NC3=CC(=C(C=C3)Cl)C(F)(F)F 1.
Rule 3: A molecule containing a phosphate group (-OPO3R2) may also have potential adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules such as COC(=O)OP(=O)(O)OC(c1ccc(cc1)I)c1ccccc1Br 1 and c1ccc(nc1)n1c(=O)n(c2ccc(cc2)Br)c(=O)n(c2ccc(cc2)Br)c1=O 1.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a halogen atom such as bromine (Br), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. The first example in the dataset contains a bromine atom and the second example contains a sulfonamide group, which supports this rule.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds between carbon atoms, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This is because conjugation can increase the stability of the molecule and make it more reactive towards other molecules. The third example in the dataset contains a conjugated system of double bonds, which supports this rule.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a heterocyclic ring structure such as pyridine (-C5H4N-) or pyrimidine (-C4H4N2-), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. These rings are known to have biological activities and can interact with various biomolecules. The last two examples in the dataset contain pyridines and pyrimidines, respectively, supporting this rule.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide, nitro, halogen, or amide in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to disrupt normal cell function by altering protein structure and inhibiting enzyme activity. They may also interfere with the body's natural repair mechanisms, leading to chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Therefore, compounds containing these functional groups should be carefully evaluated for their potential to cause adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues.
Rule 2: Compounds with a high degree of lipophilicity tend to accumulate in adipose tissue, which can lead to long-term toxicity and adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues.
Explanation: Highly lipophilic compounds can easily cross cell membranes and accumulate in fat cells, where they may remain for extended periods of time. This can lead to chronic inflammation and tissue damage, particularly in areas rich in adipose tissue such as the joints, muscles, and tendons. Therefore, compounds with high lipophilicity should be evaluated cautiously for their potential to cause adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues.
Rule 3: Compounds with a molecular weight greater than 500 Daltons may have difficulty crossing cell membranes and may accumulate in adipose tissue, increasing their potential for causing adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues.
Explanation: Large molecules may have limited mobility within cells and may require specialized transport systems to enter target tissues. Once inside the cell, large molecules may interact with cellular components and disrupt normal cell functions, leading to chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Therefore, compounds with a molecular weight greater than 500 Daltons should be evaluated carefully for their potential to cause adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide, nitro, amide, or halogenated compounds in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissues.
Rule 2: A compound containing sulfur atoms in its structure has a higher chance of exhibiting toxicity towards these tissues compared to those without sulfur.
Rule 3: Compounds having a high degree of conjugation between multiple double bonds or aromatic rings have a greater likelihood of inducing toxic effects on muscles and joints due to their increased stability and lipophilicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) or a sulfate group (-OSO3-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules C(CN)CNCCSP(=O)(O)O, CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C3(C(CC2(C1C(=O)CO)C)O)F)C, O=P(O)(O)c1ccc(cc1Br)Br, COC(=O)C(C)(C)NCC(COC1=NSN=C1N2CCOCC2)O, CNC1CCC(C2=CC=CC=C12)C3=CC(=C(C=C3)Cl)Cl, CCC(=O)OCCCCCOC(=O)CC[N+]4(CCC5=CC(=C(C=C5C4CC6=CC(=C(C=C6)OC)OC)OC)OC)C, CCS(=O)(=O)N1CC(=O)N(C(=O)N(C(=O)N2CCOCC2)C)C(C)(C)

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a fluorine atom bonded to a nitrogen atom in a five-membered ring, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. The presence of this functional group may increase the likelihood of binding to receptors or enzymes involved in these disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a carbonyl group attached to a carbon chain, then it also has a high probability of causing adverse effects on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This functional group may be responsible for altering the conformation of proteins or other macromolecules, leading to abnormal cell function or tissue damage.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a double bond between two adjacent carbon atoms, then it does not have a significant impact on musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. However, if there are multiple double bonds present in the structure, they may contribute to increased lipophilicity and enhanced penetration into cells or tissues.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a similar functional group, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl) attached to a carbon atom, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) adjacent to a double bond, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. This rule applies to molecules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
