Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have side effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules 6, 7, and 8 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have side effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules 9 and 10 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains both a sulfonamide group and a nitro group, it may have more severe side effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecule 11 in the dataset.
Note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the dataset and should be used as guidelines only. It's important to consult with a qualified chemist before using any of these rules for practical applications.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and is labeled as having the potential for adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. However, this rule should be used cautiously since there are other factors that could contribute to the toxicity of a molecule. The second molecule in the dataset contains this functional group but is labeled as not having the potential for adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (-Cl), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. This rule is based on the fact that many toxic compounds contain halogens, which can disrupt normal biochemical processes. The third molecule in the dataset contains a chlorine atom and is labeled as having the potential for adverse effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as "CCOO" or "CCON", then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings #6, #7, #8, and #9.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a metal ion such as silver or gadolinium, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings #2 and #10 respectively.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings #3 and #5.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the given dataset and should be used with caution until further research is conducted.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of chlorine atom in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects during surgery or medical procedures. This rule applies to compounds with SMILES strings starting with "Cl" as shown in the first example.
Rule 2: Compounds containing functional groups such as carbonyl groups (C=O), amide bonds (-CONH-), and ester bonds (-COOR) have higher chances of causing adverse effects if they are present in the structure. These functional groups may interact with biological molecules leading to unwanted reactions. For instance, the second example contains two carbonyl groups which could potentially react with other molecules resulting in toxicity.
Rule 3: Molecules with aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds tend to be more reactive than those without these features. Therefore, compounds with these structural characteristics should be evaluated carefully for their potential to cause adverse effects. As seen in the third example, the compound has both an aromatic ring and a conjugated double bond which increase its reactivity and make it more likely to cause harm.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-C#N), then it may have side effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with C1CCC(C1)C(CC#N)N2C=C(C=N2)C3=C4C=CNC4=NC=N3.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in conjugation with an alkene (represented by a double bond between two carbon atoms), then it may have side effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with C1=CC=C(C(=C1)C(=O)OC2=CC=CC=C2C(=O)O)O.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a metal ion such as chromium (Cr), selenium (Se), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), or manganese (Mn), then it may have side effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings containing symbols for these metals.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. For example, the sulfonamide group present in the second SMILES string "CCS(=O)(=O)CCN1C(=NC=C1[N+](=O)[O-])C" suggests that this compound could have anti-bacterial properties which could potentially lead to adverse reactions if used during surgery.
Rule 2: The molecular structure and geometry of a compound can also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects. For instance, the third SMILES string "CC1=C2C(C(=O)C3(C(CC4C(C3C(C(C2(C)C)(CC1OC(=O)C(C(C5=CC=CC=C5)NC(=O)C6=CC=CC=C6)O)O)OC(=O)C7=CC=CC=C7)(CO4)OC(=O)C)O)C)OC(=O)C" contains a conjugated system of double bonds which may increase its reactivity and potential for toxicity.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule's carbon chain can also affect its biological activity and potential for causing adverse effects. For example, the sixth SMILES string "CC(=O)OCC(=O)C12C(CC3C1(CC(C4(C3CC(C5=CC(=O)C=CC54C

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, and cyano groups in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. These functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to negative outcomes. Therefore, compounds containing these functional groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: Molecules with complex ring structures or multiple conjugated double bonds may also have higher risks of causing adverse effects due to their high reactivity and ability to form strong interactions with other molecules. Such compounds should be used cautiously or avoided altogether.
Rule 3: Compounds with aromatic rings or halogen atoms such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine may have lower risks of causing adverse effects compared to those without them. However, they still need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis depending on their specific chemical structure and application.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds between carbon atoms, then it may have potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a linear chain of five double bonds between carbon atoms. However, further analysis would be needed to determine if this molecule actually causes any side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures. The third molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a nitro group attached to one of its aromatic rings. Again, further analysis would be needed to determine if this molecule actually causes any side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), then it may have potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures. The sixth molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a sulfonamide group attached to one of its aromatic rings. This molecule is known to cause allergic reactions in some people and should be used with caution during surgical or medical procedures.

Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have side effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules 6, 7, and 8 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have side effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules 9 and 10 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains both a sulfonamide group and a nitro group, it may have more severe side effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecule 11 in the dataset.
Note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the dataset and should be used as guidelines only. It's important to consult with a qualified chemist before using any of these rules for practical applications.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. For example, the molecule represented by SMILES string CNC(=O)C1=NC=CC(=C1)OC2=CC=C(C=C2)NC(=O)NC3=CC(=C(C=C3)Cl)C(F)(F)F contains a nitro group (-NO2) which is known to be toxic and potentially harmful if ingested or inhaled. Therefore, this molecule may have the potential to cause adverse effects when used in surgical or medical procedures.
Rule 2: Certain structural features such as double bonds, triple bonds, and aromatic rings may also contribute to the potential toxicity of a molecule. For instance, the molecule C1=C/C(=C/2\N/C(=C\3/C=CC=CC3=O)/N(N2)C4=CC=C(C=C4)C(=O)O)/C(=O)C=C1 has a conjugated diene structure which is known to be highly reactive and may interact with other molecules in the body leading to adverse effects.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound may affect its ability to cross cell membranes and reach target sites within the body. Molecules with high molecular weights and hydrophobic properties may be more likely to accumulate in tissues and organs, leading to adverse effects. For example, the molecule CCC(

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in the position para to another aromatic ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an amide group (-CONH-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. The second molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. The third molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule.
Note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the dataset and should be used as guidelines only. It's important to consult with experts in the field before making any conclusions about the safety of specific molecules.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. For example, the molecule with SMILES string CC1C(C(CC(O1)OC2CC(CC3=C(C4=C(C(=C23)O)C(=O)C5=C(C4=O)C=CC=C5OC)O)(C(=O)CO)O)[NH3+])O has a positively charged nitrogen atom which could interact with negatively charged molecules on cell membranes, potentially leading to harmful reactions. Therefore, this molecule should be labeled as 1 since it has a high potential for causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: The absence of specific functional groups in a molecule may decrease its likelihood of causing adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. For instance, the molecule with SMILES string C1CC(N(C1)C(=O)C(CC2=CN=CN2)NC(=O)C3CCC(=O)N3)C(=O)N does not have any oxygen-containing functional group, so it may not interact strongly with biological systems and therefore should be labeled as 0.
Rule 3: The molecular structure and charge distribution of a molecule can also affect its ability to cause adverse effects. For example, the molecule with SMILES string CCC(=O)OCC(=O)C1(C(CC2C1(CC(C3(C2CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC43C)

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of cyano group (-CN) in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. The given SMILES string contains one such group which is represented as "C#N". Therefore, this rule suggests that molecules containing "C#N" should be avoided if they are used for surgical or medical purposes.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also lead to adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. However, the given SMILES strings do not contain any such groups. Hence, this rule cannot be applied here.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a halogen atom like chlorine (Cl) attached to a benzene ring, then it may lead to adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. The second SMILES string in the given set contains Cl attached to a benzene ring, so this rule applies to it. This indicates that molecules having chlorobenzene moiety should be avoided while using them for surgical or medical purposes.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. The first example in the dataset contains a sulfur atom bonded to two oxygen atoms, which suggests the presence of a sulfonyl group. Therefore, this molecule may have side effects during surgery or medical procedures.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom that is part of a ring structure, it may have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. The second example in the dataset contains a chlorine atom connected to a six-membered ring structure. This molecule may also have side effects during surgery or medical procedures.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbonyl group (-C=O) and another nitrogen atom, it may have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. The third example in the dataset contains a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbonyl group and another nitrogen atom, as well as a double bond between two carbon atoms. This molecule may have side effects during surgery or medical procedures.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R), it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. The presence of this functional group is known to increase the risk of allergic reactions and other complications. Therefore, molecules containing sulfonyl groups should be avoided or used with caution when performing surgeries or administering medications.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. Nitro compounds are known to be highly reactive and can cause tissue damage and other adverse effects. Therefore, molecules containing nitro groups should be avoided or used with caution when performing surgeries or administering medications.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. Halogen atoms can react with proteins and other biomolecules, leading to changes in their structure and function. Therefore, molecules containing halogen atoms should be avoided or used with caution when performing surgeries or administering medications.

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N, then it may have side effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule is based on the fact that this substructure is present in two molecules labeled as having side effects (SMILES strings "C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N.CC(=O)O.C1=CC(=CC=C1C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N)O.C(CCN)C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N.C(CC(=O)O)[C@@H](C(=O)O)N 1" and "C1CNN(Cc2ccccc2n2nc(C)nc(C)c2nn2C)NN1C#N") but absent from all other molecules in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure CC(F)(F)F, then it may not have side effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule is based on the fact that this substructure is only present in one molecule labeled as not having side effects (SMILES string "C1C(=S)N(C2=C(C=C(C=C2)Cl)C(=N1)C3=CC=CC=C3F)CC(F)(F)F 0") among all the molecules in the dataset.

Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. The presence of this functional group in certain drugs such as penicillin and other antibiotics is known to cause allergic reactions in some patients. Therefore, it is important to consider the structure of the molecule when predicting its potential side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may also have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. Nitro compounds are commonly used as explosives but they can also cause irritation and damage to tissues. It is recommended to avoid using these types of molecules in medical applications unless necessary.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) attached to a carbon atom, then it may also have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. Halogen atoms can react with proteins and enzymes in the body, causing tissue damage and inflammation. It is important to carefully evaluate the chemical structure of any new drug candidate before administering it to patients.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as nitro group (-NO2) or halogen atoms like fluorine (-F) in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects during surgical and medical procedures. This rule can be applied to the first SMILES string where the presence of the nitro group (-NO2) and fluoride atom (-F) increases the likelihood of this molecule being associated with adverse effects.
Rule 2: A molecule containing conjugated double bonds and aromatic rings may have higher chances of causing adverse effects compared to molecules without these features. This rule can be applied to the second SMILES string where the presence of multiple conjugated double bonds and benzene ring makes this molecule more likely to cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: Molecules with polar functional groups such as carboxylic acid (-COOH), primary amine (-NH2), or secondary amide (-CONHR) may have lower risks of causing adverse effects than nonpolar compounds. This rule can be applied to the third SMILES string where the absence of any polar functional groups reduces the risk of this molecule causing adverse effects.

This rule applies to molecules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 7

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group called "nitrile" (-CN), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. The presence of this functional group indicates that the molecule may be toxic and could potentially harm tissues or organs during surgery or medical treatment.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a metal ion such as gallium (Ga) or gadolinium (Gd), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. These metals may interfere with the normal functioning of cells or tissues, leading to complications or adverse reactions during surgery or medical treatment.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a functional group called "carbonyl" (-C=O), then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures. This functional group is commonly found in many organic compounds and is essential for their biological activities. However, excessive exposure to these molecules may still lead to negative health outcomes, so caution should always be exercised when using them.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as "CCOO" or "CCON", then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings #6, #7, #8, and #9.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a metal ion such as silver or gadolinium, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings #2 and #10 respectively.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings #3 and #5.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the given dataset and should be used with caution until further research is conducted.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. For example, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in the first SMILES string suggests that this molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects due to its ability to interact with biological molecules such as proteins and DNA. Similarly, the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the second SMILES string also indicates the possibility of adverse effects.
Rule 2: The molecular structure and size of a compound can also play a role in determining its toxicity. For instance, the third SMILES string contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) which is known for its toxic properties. Additionally, the length of the carbon chain in the fourth SMILES string may contribute to its toxicity since longer chains tend to be more hydrophobic and can disrupt cell membranes.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule can also affect its toxicity. For example, the fifth SMILES string contains a double bond between two carbon atoms, which creates a chiral center. The presence of a chiral center can lead to different enantiomers with potentially different biological activities. Therefore, it is important to consider both the structural features and stereochemistry of a molecule when predicting its toxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects during surgical or medical procedures:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. The presence of this functional group in certain drugs such as penicillin and other antibiotics is known to cause allergic reactions in some patients. Therefore, it is important to consider the structure of the molecule when predicting its potential side effects.

Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) attached to a carbon atom, then it may also have side effects during surgery or medical procedures. Halogen atoms can react with proteins and enzymes in the body, causing tissue damage and inflammation. It is important to carefully evaluate the chemical structure of any new drug candidate before administering it to patients.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of chlorine atom in the structure of the molecule, then it may have potential for causing adverse effects during surgical or medical procedures. The presence of halogen atoms like chlorine can increase the reactivity of molecules which can lead to unwanted interactions with other molecules inside the body. This rule applies to the first two SMILES strings provided where the presence of Cl atoms makes them more likely to exhibit side-effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains multiple rings or conjugated systems, it may also be associated with increased risk of adverse effects due to their ability to interact with other molecules within the body. This rule applies to the third and fourth SMILES strings provided where the presence of multiple aromatic rings increases the likelihood of interaction with biological targets.
Rule 3: If the molecule has a functional group that is known to react with proteins or enzymes, it may pose a higher risk of inducing adverse effects. For example, the fifth SMILES string contains a nitro group which is known to be reactive and can potentially bind to proteins leading to toxicity. Therefore, this rule suggests that molecules containing such groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile before being used in surgical or medical procedures.
