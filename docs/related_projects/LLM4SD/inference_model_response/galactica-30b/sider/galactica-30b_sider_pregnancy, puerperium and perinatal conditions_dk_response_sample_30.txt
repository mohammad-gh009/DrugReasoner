Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group called isocyanate (-N=C=O), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a functional group called nitroso (-NO), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The second molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has also been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a functional group called carboxylic acid (-COOH), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The third molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having potential side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The presence of these functional groups in a compound can increase its toxicity and affect various body systems including the reproductive system. For example, the molecule CCOC1=CC=CC=C1OCCN[C@@H](C)CC2=CC(=C(C=C2)OC)S(=O)(=O)N.Cl contains both a sulfonamide group and a chlorine atom, which may contribute to its toxic effects. Therefore, this rule suggests that molecules containing such functional groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal periods.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule is based on the fact that some compounds containing a cyano group have been associated with developmental toxicity and teratogenicity. For instance, the molecule CCNC(=O)C1CCCN1C(=O)C(CCCN=C(N)N)NC(=O)C(CC(C)C)NC(=O)C(COC(C)(C)C)NC(=O)C(CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)NC(=O)C(CO)NC(=O)C(CC3=CNC4=CC=CC=C43)NC(=O)C(CC5=CN=CN5)NC(=O)C6CCC(=O)N6 contains a cyano group connected to a carbonyl group through a single bond. Therefore, this rule suggests that molecules containing such structural features should also be carefully evaluated for their safety during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal periods.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Halogen atoms can alter the chemical and physical properties of a compound, leading to changes in its biological activity and toxicity. For example, the molecule CCC(CO)NC(=O)C1CN(C2CC3=CNC4

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The presence of these functional groups in a compound can increase its toxicity and affect various body systems including the reproductive system. For example, sulfonamides are known to cross the placenta and can cause birth defects when taken by pregnant women. Nitro compounds also have teratogenic effects and can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, and other developmental abnormalities. Therefore, molecules containing these functional groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety during pregnancy.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Halogen atoms can alter the chemical and physical properties of a compound and affect its biological activity. For instance, some halogenated hydrocarbons such as trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are known to cause reproductive and developmental problems in animals and humans. Therefore, molecules containing halogen atoms should be tested for their potential toxic effects on the fetus and newborn baby.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring such as pyridine or pyrimidine, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Nitrogen-containing heterocycles are commonly found in drugs and pesticides and can interact with various biomolecules leading to toxic effects. For example, pyridines are known to disrupt fetal development and cause birth defects in animals. Pyrimidines

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The first example in the dataset contains both groups and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may also have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The second example in the dataset contains this structural feature and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen-containing ring structure, specifically a pyrimidine ring (-C4H4N2-) or a pyridine ring (-C5H5N-), then it may also have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The third example in the dataset contains a pyrimidine ring and has been labeled as having such side effects.

Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) conjugated with an alkene or alkyne group, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The second molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has also been labeled as having no such side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrile group (-CN) adjacent to an aromatic ring, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The third molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having no such side effects.

Rule 2: If the molecule contains a functional group such as NC(=O)[C@@H]1CCCN1C(=O)[C@H](CCCCNC(C)C)NC(=O)[C@H](CC(C)C)NC(=O)[C@@H](CC2=CC=C(C=C2)NC(=O)N)NC(=O)[C@H](CC3=CC=C(C=C3)NC(=O)[C@@H]4CC(=O)NC(=O)N4)NC(=O)[C@H](CO)NC(=O)[C@@H](CC5=CN=CC=C5)NC(=O)[C@@H](CC6=CC=C(C=C6)Cl)NC(=O)[C@@H](CC7=CC8=CC=CC=C8C=C7)NC(=O)C

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The first example in the dataset contains both groups and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds between carbon atoms, including at least one carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may also have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule applies to the second example in the dataset, which contains a cyano group (-CN) instead of a carbonyl group but still has the same conjugated system.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine) attached to a carbon atom, then it may not have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule applies to the last two examples in the dataset, which contain either fluorine or chlorine atoms and have been labeled as not having such side effects.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of functional groups such as -COOH or -OH in the molecular structure, then it may lead to potential toxicity issues during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The molecule may interfere with normal metabolic processes leading to adverse effects on the fetus or newborn infant. Therefore, molecules containing these functional groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic rings may also pose safety concerns due to their ability to bind to receptors in the body and disrupt normal physiological functions. These types of compounds should be used cautiously during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 3: Compounds containing nitrogen atoms may have toxic effects on fetal development depending on the type of substitution on the nitrogen atom. For example, molecules containing primary amines may cross the placenta and affect fetal growth and development while secondary or tertiary amines may have less severe effects. Therefore, careful consideration must be given when using molecules containing nitrogen atoms during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as C[C@](CC1=CC(=C(C=C1)O)O)(C(=O)O) or CC1CC(CCC1OP(=O)([O-])OC[C@@H](CN(CCN(CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])N(CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])(C2=CC=CC=C2)C3=CC=CC=C3, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfhydryl group (-SH) or a disulfide bond (-SS-), then it may have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The presence of these functional groups in a molecule can affect its reactivity and binding ability, which could lead to negative consequences for the mother and fetus.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains iodine atoms, then it may also have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Iodine is essential for fetal development, but excessive intake or exposure to iodine can disrupt thyroid function and lead to developmental abnormalities.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains fluorine atoms, then it may not have any significant side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Fluorine is commonly found in pharmaceuticals and is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy. However, more research is needed to fully understand the impact of fluorinated compounds on maternal and fetal health.

This rule applies to molecules represented by the fourth SMILES string labeled as 0 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains the substructure "C1=CNN=C(C2=C1C(=C(S2)C3=NC(=Nc=n3)C)SSC3)C4=CC=CC=C4F" in its SMILES representation, then it may have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions.

Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine) attached to a carbon atom, then it may not have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule applies to the last two examples in the dataset, which contain either fluorine or chlorine atoms and have been labeled as not having such side effects.

Explanation: These two molecules contain functional groups that are commonly found in drugs that can cause birth defects or other adverse effects during pregnancy. The first molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) which can interact with DNA and cause mutations, while the second molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) which can interfere with normal cell function. Both of these groups have been linked to teratogenic effects in animal studies.

This functional group can form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues in proteins, which can affect their function and stability.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine bonded to an aromatic ring, then it may be less likely to have side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Halogen atoms can increase the hydrophobicity of a compound, making it more difficult for it to penetrate cell membranes and interact with biological targets.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The presence of these functional groups in a compound can increase its toxicity and affect various body systems including the reproductive system. For example, the molecule CCOC1=CC=CC=C1OCCN[C@@H](C)CC2=CC(=C(C=C2)OC)S(=O)(=O)N.Cl contains both a sulfonamide group and a chlorine atom, which may contribute to its toxic effects. Therefore, this rule suggests that molecules containing such functional groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal periods.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule is based on the fact that some compounds containing a cyano group have been associated with developmental toxicity and teratogenicity. For instance, the molecule CCNC(=O)C1CCCN1C(=O)C(CCCN=C(N)N)NC(=O)C(CC(C)C)NC(=O)C(COC(C)(C)C)NC(=O)C(CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)NC(=O)C(CO)NC(=O)C(CC3=CNC4=CC=CC=C43)NC(=O)C(CC5=CN=CN5)NC(=O)C6CCC(=O)N6 contains a cyano group connected to a carbonyl group through a single bond. Therefore, this rule suggests that molecules containing such structural features should also be carefully evaluated for their safety during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal periods.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.

Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to two other nitrogen atoms in a five-membered ring structure, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The second molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule by having a pyrazole ring structure.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (a double bond between a carbon atom and an oxygen atom) conjugated with another double bond or a triple bond, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The third molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule by having a dienone moiety.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The presence of these functional groups in a compound indicates its ability to cross the placenta and affect fetal development. Therefore, such compounds should be avoided if possible during pregnancy.
Rule 2: If a compound has a quinazoline ring system, then it may also have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Quinazolines are known to act as antagonists for various receptors involved in reproductive functions; therefore, their use during pregnancy must be carefully evaluated.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may potentially interact with estrogen receptors and disrupt hormonal balance. Such compounds should be avoided during pregnancy due to their potential teratogenic effects on the fetus.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of functional groups such as -COOH or -OH in the molecular structure, then it may lead to potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" because they do not have these specific functional groups but still could potentially cause harm if present in high concentrations.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains aromatic rings, such as benzene or pyridine, it may also increase the risk of causing adverse effects on pregnant women, their babies, or both. Therefore, this rule applies to all molecules regardless of their labeling.
Rule 3: The number of carbon atoms in the molecular structure does not necessarily correlate with its ability to cause adverse effects. However, larger molecules tend to be more complex and may contain multiple functional groups that could contribute to toxicity. Therefore, this rule only applies to molecules whose size varies significantly from one another.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of sulfur in the molecular structure, then it may have potential side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The given SMILES string contains a sulfonamide group which is known for its antimicrobial property but has been associated with teratogenic effects when taken during pregnancy. Therefore, this rule suggests that molecules containing sulfur should be avoided or used cautiously while pregnant women.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains metal ions such as calcium, sodium, or iodine, they may also pose some risks to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. However, more research needs to be done to determine their specific effects. This rule suggests that caution should be exercised when using these types of compounds during pregnancy.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains halogen atoms like chlorine or fluorine, they may increase the risk of birth defects if taken during pregnancy. These elements can cross the placenta and affect fetal development. Therefore, this rule suggests that molecules containing halogens should be avoided or used cautiously while pregnant women.

Rule 1: If there is any occurrence of the SMILES string CC[C@H](C)[C@@H](C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(=O)O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(=O)O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC(C)C)C(=O)O)NC(=O)[C@H](CCC(=O)O)NC(=O)[C@H](CCC(=O)O)NC(=O)[C@H](CC3=CC=CC=C3)NC(=O)[C@H](CC(=O)O)NC(=O)CNC(=O)[C@H](CC(=O)N)NC(=O)CNC(=O)CNC(=O)CNC(=O)CNC(=O)CNC(=O)[C@@H]4CCCN4C(=O)[C@H](CCCNC(=N)N)NC(=O)[C@@H]5CCCN5C(=O)[C@@H](CC6=CC=CC=C6)N in the compound's structure,
