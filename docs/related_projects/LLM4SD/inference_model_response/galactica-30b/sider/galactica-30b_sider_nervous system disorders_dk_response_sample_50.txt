Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to nervous system disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a similar functional group, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. The presence of this group is known to be associated with neurological toxicity and should therefore be avoided in drug design.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. Nitro groups are known to be highly reactive and can interact with biological molecules, leading to toxic effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. Halogen atoms can affect the chemical and physical properties of a molecule, including its reactivity and lipophilicity, which can impact its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and interact with target proteins.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-COOH" in the molecular structure may indicate potential adverse effects on the central nervous system. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 and 9.
Rule 2: The absence of any nitrogen atoms in the molecular structure may suggest low toxicity or no adverse effects at all. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 0.
Rule 3: The presence of multiple aromatic rings in the molecular structure may increase its potential for adverse effects on the central nervous system. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 and 9.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects on the nervous system. For example, molecules containing nitro groups or halogen atoms such as chlorine and fluorine have been known to cause neurological problems. Therefore, if a molecule contains these functional groups, it should be labeled as having a high likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Rule 2: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure may also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects on the nervous system. Longer and more complex structures may be harder for the body to process, leading to negative consequences. Therefore, if a molecule has a relatively large molecular weight or a complicated structure, it should be labeled as having a moderate likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Rule 3: The charge and polarity of a molecule may affect how easily it crosses the blood-brain barrier and enters the central nervous system. Molecules with a positive charge or polar functional groups may be more likely to cross the blood-brain barrier than neutral or nonpolar ones. Therefore, if a molecule has a charged or highly polar functional group, it should be labeled as having a low likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as -COOH, -OH, and -CHO in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system. These functional groups can interact with receptors or enzymes in the body, leading to unwanted reactions.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings such as benzene or pyridine may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects due to their ability to bind to proteins and other molecules through π-π interactions.
Rule 3: Compounds with high molecular weight and complex structures tend to be more toxic than those with lower weights and simpler structures. This is because they have a greater chance of interacting with biological systems and disrupting normal functions.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of sulfur in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on the nervous system. The first molecule has a sulfur atom and hence belongs to this category.
Rule 2: If there is any presence of metal ions like gold or magnesium in the molecular structure, then it may also lead to adverse effects on the nervous system. The fourth molecule has two gold atoms and hence belongs to this category.
Rule 3: If there is any presence of halogen atoms like chlorine or fluorine in the molecular structure, then it may increase the lipophilicity of the molecule which may lead to adverse effects on the nervous system. The eleventh molecule has one chlorine atom and hence belongs to this category.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict whether a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to nervous system disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom and a carbonyl group (represented by the SMILES string "C(=O)Cl"), then it is likely to have side-effect activity related to nervous system disorders. This rule applies to molecules 1, 8, and 9.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a germanium atom and a carbonyl group (represented by the SMILES string "C(=O)Ge"), then it is also likely to have side-effect activity related to nervous system disorders. This rule applies to molecule 2.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom and a sulfonyl group (represented by the SMILES string "SO2F"), then it may have some side-effect activity related to nervous system disorders. However, this rule is less certain than Rules 1 and 2 because there are only two examples of such molecules in the dataset. It applies to molecules 10 and 11.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to nervous system disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and a nitrogen atom bonded to another carbon atom, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CC(=O)NO, C1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C3(C(CC2(C1(C(=O)CO)O)C)O)F)C, and CC(=O)N(CC(CN(C1=C(C(=C(C(=C1I)C(=O)NCC(CO)O)I)C(=O)NCC(CO)O)I)C(=O)C)O)C2=C(C(=C(C(=C2I)C(=O)NCC(CO)O)I)C(=O)NCC(CO)O)I.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5) and a chlorine atom (Cl), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CCCCCCCCCC1=CC=C(C=C1)CCC(CO)(CO)N.Cl and C1(C(C(C(C(C1Cl)Cl)

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as amines and amides in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the nervous system. This rule can be applied to compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system due to their ability to interact with biological molecules through π-π stacking interactions. This rule can be applied to compounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound may also play a role in determining its potential to cause adverse effects on the nervous system. Generally, larger and more hydrophobic compounds tend to have greater bioavailability and may be more likely to cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to neurological effects. However, this rule should be used cautiously since other factors such as charge and hydrogen bonding capacity can also affect permeability across membranes. This rule can be applied to compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a nitrogen atom in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on the nervous system. The presence of chlorine atoms and aromatic rings also increases the likelihood of causing such effects.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains functional groups like carbonyl, carboxyl or sulfonyl, they may affect the central nervous system by binding to receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure has a high degree of symmetry, it may indicate that it has a higher potential for toxicity due to its ability to interact with multiple targets simultaneously.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system. For example, the presence of chlorine atoms and platinum ions in the given SMILES strings suggests that they may have some neurotoxic properties.
Rule 2: The length and complexity of a molecule may also play a role in determining its potential for neurotoxicity. The longer and more complex the molecule, the greater the probability of it interacting with biological systems in ways that could lead to adverse effects. Therefore, molecules like CNC1CCC(C2=CC=CC=C12)C3=CC(=C(C=C3)Cl)Cl and C[C@@H](CC1=CC=CC=C1)NC(=O)[C@H](CCCCN)N, which are relatively long and complex, may be more likely to cause adverse effects than simpler molecules such as CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CC=CC=C2 or COC1=C(C=C2C(=C1)C(=NC(=N2)N3CCN(CC3)C(=O)C4CCCO4)N)OC.
Rule 3: The specific arrangement of atoms within a molecule may also affect its ability to cause adverse effects. For instance, the presence of multiple carbonyl groups in CC(C)NCC(COC1=CC=CC=C1OCC=C)O suggests that it has a high potential for neurotoxicity due to its ability to interact with biological systems through hydrogen bonding and

================================

Rule 1: If there is a nitro group present in the structure of the molecule, then it may have adverse effects on the nervous system. The presence of a nitro group can increase the polarity and reactivity of the molecule which can lead to toxic effects. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should be avoided or used with caution if they are intended for use as drugs.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group, it may also have adverse effects on the nervous system. Sulfonyl groups are known to bind to receptors in the brain and spinal cord, leading to overstimulation and seizures. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should be avoided or used with caution if they are intended for use as drugs.
Rule 3: If the molecule has a high degree of lipophilicity, it may cross the blood-brain barrier more easily and cause adverse effects on the central nervous system. Lipophilicity refers to the ability of a molecule to dissolve in fats and oils, and it is often measured by its partition coefficient between water and octanol. Molecules with higher values of logP (partition coefficient) tend to be more lipophilic and may have greater potential for toxicity. Therefore, molecules with high logP values should be avoided or used with caution if they are intended for use as drugs.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to nervous system disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and two sodium ions (Na+), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. The presence of these groups suggests that the molecule may interact with receptors or enzymes involved in neurological processes, leading to unwanted effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a cyclopropane ring and a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. Cyclopropane rings are known to increase the lipophilicity of molecules, which can affect their ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets. Carbonyl groups can form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues in proteins, potentially altering their structure and function.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a guanidine group (-C(NH2)=NR) and a chlorine atom (Cl), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. Guanidines are known to act as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators, and halogen atoms can enhance the binding affinity of ligands for their target proteins. However, further research would be needed to confirm the relevance of these structural features to the specific type of adverse effect being considered.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) and sulfonyl group (SO2R) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to toxicity or adverse reactions. For example, the carbonyl group present in acetaminophen (Tylenol) is responsible for its analgesic and antipyretic activities but also contributes to its hepatotoxic effects at high doses. Similarly, the sulfonyl group found in sulfonamide antibiotics can inhibit the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase, which is involved in folate biosynthesis, leading to bacterial resistance and potentially severe allergic reactions.
Rule 2: A compound containing multiple aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may exhibit neurotoxic effects due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and interfere with neurotransmitter function.
Explanation: Aromatic compounds such as benzene and toluene are known to be neurotoxic and can cause symptoms such as dizziness, headache, nausea, and confusion. Conjugated double bonds in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can react with free radicals and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can damage cellular components and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
Rule 3: A compound containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine may enhance its lipophilicity and increase its potential for crossing the blood-brain barrier, leading to neurotoxicity.
Explanation: Halogen atoms are highly electronegative and can increase the polarity of adjacent bonds, making them more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by biological molecules. This property makes halogens useful in drug design as they can improve membrane permeability and bioavailability. However, excessive exposure to halogenated compounds has been linked to neurological disorders such as polyneuropathy, encephalopathy, and myeloneuropathy.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system. For example, the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an amine group (NH) in the given SMILES strings suggests that these molecules have the potential to interact with biological receptors involved in neurological functions.
Rule 2: The molecular structure and geometry play a crucial role in determining the potency of a molecule towards causing adverse effects. For instance, the presence of aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds in some of the given SMILES strings indicates that they may possess planar structures that facilitate π-π stacking interactions with target proteins. These types of interactions can lead to changes in protein conformation and disrupt normal cellular processes.
Rule 3: The charge distribution within a molecule also affects its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with intracellular targets. Molecules with polar functional groups such as hydroxyl (OH) or amino (NH2) groups can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules and become hydrophilic, which makes them less likely to penetrate through lipid bilayers. On the other hand, nonpolar molecules like hydrocarbons tend to be more lipophilic and easily cross cell membranes. Therefore, the overall polarity and hydrophobicity of a molecule should be considered when predicting its toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the nervous system. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, the first molecule contains a nitro group and has been associated with nervous system disorders.
Rule 2: A compound containing a sulfhydryl group (-SH) or disulfide bond (-SS-) may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For instance, the third molecule contains both a sulfhydryl group and a disulfide bond, which have been linked to neurotoxicity.
Rule 3: A compound containing a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F) may also increase the risk of causing adverse effects on the nervous system. This rule can be applied to all molecules in the given dataset. For example, the sixth molecule contains two chlorine atoms and has been reported to exhibit neurotoxic effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of negatively charged atoms such as oxygen and sulfur in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system. This rule can be applied to compounds labeled as 1 in the dataset. For example, the first compound contains two sodium ions which may contribute to its ability to disrupt the nervous system.
Rule 2: Compounds containing functional groups such as phosphate or carboxylate groups have a higher chance of causing adverse effects than those without them. These groups can interact with proteins and other molecules in the body, leading to unwanted reactions. Therefore, this rule can be used to identify potential toxic compounds among those labeled as 1. For instance, the third compound has a gadolinium ion attached to a phosphate group, which could increase its toxicity.
Rule 3: Molecules with certain structural features such as aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds are more likely to cause adverse effects compared to others. This rule can help distinguish between compounds labeled as 1 and 0 based on their chemical structure. For example, the sixth compound has an aromatic ring and a conjugated double bond, making it potentially harmful.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group and double bonds in the molecular structure may increase the likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: Carbonyl group and double bonds are known to have high reactivity which can interact with biological molecules leading to toxic effects. These functional groups may also affect the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the molecule within the body.
Rule 2: The size and shape of the molecule may play a role in determining its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and reach target sites within the central nervous system.
Explanation: Molecules with smaller size and more flexible structures may be able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier more easily than larger or rigid ones. However, this rule should be applied cautiously since other factors such as charge and polarity can also influence the permeability of the molecule across the membrane.
Rule 3: The presence of certain atoms or substructures in the molecule may indicate potential toxicity. For example, the presence of sulfur or nitrogen atoms in the ring structure may increase the risk of neurotoxicity due to their ability to form reactive metabolites.
Explanation: Sulfur and nitrogen atoms can undergo oxidation or reduction reactions forming electrophilic or nucleophilic species that can react with biological macromolecules leading to cellular damage. Additionally, these atoms can participate in hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions affecting the binding affinity of the molecule towards receptors or enzymes.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to disrupt normal cellular processes by binding to receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission, leading to neurotoxicity. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile when used in therapeutic applications.
Rule 2: A compound with a high degree of lipophilicity may also exhibit increased toxicity due to its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with intracellular targets.
Explanation: Highly lipophilic molecules tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues like the brain and liver, which can lead to toxic effects. Therefore, it is important to consider the pharmacokinetic properties of a compound when evaluating its potential for adverse effects.
Rule 3: Compounds with a molecular weight greater than 500 Daltons may have limited bioavailability and penetration into the central nervous system, making them less likely to cause adverse effects.
Explanation: Large molecules may have difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier, limiting their access to target sites within the CNS. Therefore, smaller molecules may be more promising candidates for drug development targeting neurological conditions.

================================

Based on these given SMILES strings and their corresponding labels, here are three possible rules that could be used to predict whether a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to nervous system disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by the first two SMILES strings provided above.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a conjugated system consisting of multiple double bonds separated by single bonds, such as in the third SMILES string, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a benzene ring connected to another aromatic ring through a nitrogen atom, such as in the fifth SMILES string, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of sulfonate group (-SO3-) in the structure of a molecule, then it may have potential side effects on the nervous system. The given SMILES string C1[C@H]([C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O1)O[C@@H]2CO[C@H]([C@@H]([C@H]2OS(=O)(=O)O)OS(=O)(=O)O)O)OS(=O)(=O)O)OS(=O)(=O)O)O contains one sulfonate group and has been labeled as having potential side effects on the nervous system.
Rule 2: If there is a presence of a conjugated double bond system in the structure of a molecule, then it may also have potential side effects on the nervous system. The given SMILES strings CC12CC(C3C(C1CCC2(C(=O)CO)O)CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC34C)O and CCC1=NC=CC(=C1)C(=S)N contain such systems and have been labeled as having potential side effects on the nervous system.
Rule 3: If there is a presence of a heterocyclic ring in the structure of a molecule, then it may also have potential side effects on the nervous system.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains sulfur and oxygen atoms in its ring or chain, then it may have potential side effects on the central nervous system. The presence of these elements increases the likelihood of causing neurological problems such as seizures, tremors, and hallucinations. For example, the first SMILES string has a sulfone group which is known for its neurotoxicity. Therefore, this compound could potentially cause adverse effects on the nervous system.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains multiple aromatic rings connected by single bonds, then it may also have potential side effects on the central nervous system. These types of structures tend to be more lipophilic and can cross the blood-brain barrier easily. For instance, the third SMILES string has two phenyl groups attached to the same carbon atom, making it highly lipophilic. This property makes it easier for the compound to penetrate the brain tissue and cause adverse effects.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains functional groups such as nitro, cyano, or carbonyl groups, then it may also have potential side effects on the cardiovascular system. These types of compounds can interfere with the normal functioning of the heart and blood vessels, leading to various health issues such as hypertension, arrhythmia, and heart failure. For example, the last SMILES string has a nitro group which is known for its cardiotoxicity. Therefore, this compound could potentially cause adverse effects on the cardiovascular system.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict whether a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to nervous system disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a similar functional group, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. The first molecule in the dataset contains such a group and is labeled as having a side-effect activity related to nervous system disorders.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or fluorine) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. The second molecule in the dataset contains such a structure and is also labeled as having a side-effect activity related to nervous system disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a heterocyclic ring containing nitrogen atoms, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains such a ring and is labeled as having no side-effect activity related to nervous system disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) and halogen atoms like chlorine (Cl) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: Carbonyl group is known to interact with biological molecules and alter their function. Chlorine atom is also known to be toxic and can disrupt normal cellular processes. Therefore, compounds containing these functional groups may have a higher chance of interacting with neural tissues and causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: Compounds with complex ring structures or multiple conjugated double bonds may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: Complex rings or conjugated double bonds can increase the lipophilicity of a compound, making it more likely to cross the blood-brain barrier and interact with neural tissue. This can lead to neurotoxicity and other adverse effects.
Rule 3: The presence of certain chemical elements such as gold (Au) or sulfur (S) in a compound may indicate a high likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: Gold and sulfur are both highly reactive and can form strong covalent bonds with other molecules. These interactions can potentially disrupt normal biochemical pathways and cause toxicity. Therefore, compounds containing these elements should be evaluated carefully for their potential to cause adverse effects on the nervous system.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to nervous system disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) separated by one or more atoms, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. The first example in the dataset meets this criterion and has been labeled as having the potential for such effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to a carbon atom that also forms part of a ring structure, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. The second example in the dataset meets this criterion and has been labeled as having the potential for such effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. The third example in the dataset meets this criterion and has been labeled as having the potential for such effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and chloride in the given molecules may indicate potential side effects on the central nervous system due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, these molecules should be labeled as having a high likelihood of causing neurological side effects.
Rule 2: The presence of calcium ions in the molecular structure suggests that the compound could have a role in regulating cellular processes within the body's cells or tissues. However, if this ion is present in conjunction with other structural features that suggest toxicity, then there is a higher probability of adverse reactions occurring.
Rule 3: Molecules containing sodium and iodide ions do not necessarily imply any specific biological function but rather reflect the chemical composition of the environment where they were synthesized or isolated. These compounds would likely not exhibit any significant physiological impact under normal conditions.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, nitro, and carbonyl groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to various health problems including neurological disorders. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles before being used in therapeutic applications.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also exhibit neurotoxic effects due to their ability to penetrate cell membranes and interfere with cellular processes.
Explanation: Aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds are often found in drugs and other chemicals that are designed to interact with specific targets within cells. However, if these structures are present in high concentrations or are highly reactive, they may cause unintended damage to cellular components such as proteins and DNA.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a compound may also play a role in determining its neurotoxicity. Generally, larger and more hydrophobic molecules tend to have greater access to the central nervous system and may be more likely to cause adverse effects.
Explanation: Larger molecules may require more time to cross the blood-brain barrier, which protects the brain from harmful substances in the bloodstream. Hydrophobic molecules are more likely to bind to lipid bilayers in cell membranes and disrupt their normal function. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the size and polarity of candidate compounds when designing new therapies for neurological disorders.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to nervous system disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a similar functional group, it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. The presence of this group is known to have neurological effects and can disrupt normal brain function.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. Nitro groups are known to be toxic and can cause damage to nerve cells.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. Benzene rings are known to be neurotoxic and can affect the central nervous system.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the dataset and should be used as a starting point for further investigation rather than definitive evidence.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R) and has a negative charge on one of its oxygen atoms, then it may have side effects related to nervous system disorders. The first example in the dataset contains such a structure and has been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a nitro group (NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, and if there is also a carbonyl group (C=O) adjacent to the nitro group, then it may be associated with side effects related to nervous system disorders. The second example in the dataset contains this structure and has been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 3: If a compound contains two chlorine atoms bonded to the same carbon atom, and if at least one of those chlorine atoms is bonded to another nitrogen atom, then it may not be associated with side effects related to nervous system disorders. The fourth example in the dataset contains this structure and has been labeled as not having potential side effects.

================================

Rule 1: If there is presence of sodium ion in the molecular structure and absence of chlorine atom then it may have potential for causing adverse effects on Nervous System Disorders.
Explanation: The given SMILES string contains Sodium ion which indicates that the compound might be ionic in nature. Ionic compounds tend to be more reactive than non-ionic ones due to their polar nature. Therefore, they could potentially interact with biological systems leading to adverse effects. Additionally, the absence of Chlorine atom suggests that the compound has low lipophilicity making it less likely to cross the blood brain barrier resulting in reduced efficacy or increased toxicity.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains Nitrogen atoms bonded to multiple rings such as Pyrimidine ring, then it may have potential for causing adverse effects on Nervous System Disorders.
Explanation: Multiple rings increase the complexity of the chemical structure which often leads to decreased stability and increased reactivity. This makes them more prone to interactions with biological molecules like proteins and nucleic acids leading to adverse effects. Moreover, nitrogen atoms present in these structures are known to form hydrogen bonds with other molecules increasing their affinity towards biological targets.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains Carbonyl group (C=O) connected to another carbon chain through single bond, then it may have potential for causing adverse effects on Nervous System Disorders.
Explanation: Carbonyl groups are highly reactive and can easily form covalent bonds with other molecules including amino acids, peptides etc. These interactions can lead to changes in protein structure and function affecting various cellular processes. Additionally, long carbon chains can make the compound lipophilic allowing it to penetrate cell membranes and affect intracellular processes.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) and sulfonamide group (SO2NH2) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: Carbonyl and sulfonamide groups are known to have a high affinity towards receptors in the central nervous system, which can lead to various neurological symptoms. For example, compounds containing these groups have been shown to act as agonists or antagonists at specific neurotransmitter receptors, leading to changes in brain function and behavior.
Rule 2: A compound with a long carbon chain or aromatic ring structure may also be associated with increased risk of adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: Longer carbon chains and aromatic rings can increase the lipophilicity of a compound, making it more likely to cross the blood-brain barrier and interact with neuronal receptors. This can result in a range of neurological effects, including seizures, hallucinations, and cognitive impairment.
Rule 3: Compounds containing electronegative atoms such as fluorine, chlorine, and oxygen may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds with biological molecules.
Explanation: Electronegative atoms can alter the electronic distribution within a compound, affecting its chemical reactivity and binding affinity towards target receptors. For example, fluorinated compounds have been found to exhibit altered pharmacokinetic profiles compared to non-fluorinated analogs, resulting in differences in potency and efficacy.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) and cyano group (-CN) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also have a higher likelihood of exhibiting neurological side effects.
Rule 3: Compounds having polar functional groups like hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH2), and carboxyl (-COOH) may be less likely to cross the blood-brain barrier and affect the central nervous system.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects on the nervous system. For example, the molecule containing the sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) has been associated with neurological side effects such as seizures and hallucinations. Similarly, molecules containing the nitro group (-NO2) have also been linked to neurotoxicity. Therefore, if a molecule contains these or similar functional groups, it should be carefully evaluated for potential adverse effects on the nervous system.
Rule 2: The molecular structure and geometry play a crucial role in determining the biological activity of a compound. For instance, the length and flexibility of the carbon chain in fatty acids determine their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and affect neuronal function. Similarly, the shape and size of the aromatic ring in neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin influence their binding affinity to receptors in the brain. Therefore, the structural features of a molecule must be considered when predicting its potential to cause adverse effects on the nervous system.
Rule 3: The lipophilicity of a molecule affects its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profile. Molecules with high lipophilicity tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues such as the brain and liver, leading to toxicity. Therefore, the hydrophobicity of a molecule should be taken into account while evaluating its potential to cause adverse effects on the nervous system.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of chlorine atom in the structure and if its position is at the para or meta positions on the benzene ring then it may lead to adverse effects related to neurological disorders. The first example in the given dataset has both these features and hence it belongs to this category.
Rule 2: If there is a presence of carbonyl group (-C=O) in the structure and if it is conjugated with another double bond such as -CH=CH- or -C=C- then it may also lead to adverse effects related to neurological disorders. This rule applies to the second example in the dataset where the carbonyl group is present along with two double bonds.
Rule 3: If there is a presence of a heterocyclic ring in the structure containing nitrogen atoms then it may increase the chances of causing adverse effects related to neurological disorders. This rule applies to the third example in the dataset which contains a pyrimidine ring.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to nervous system disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and a benzene ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CN1CCN2C(C1)C3=CC=CC=C3CC4=CC=CC=C42 1 and C1CNN(C(=O)C2=NN=C(C(=C2)Cl)Cc3ccccn3)C1 1.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a pyridine ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings CC(=O)NCC1CN(C(=O)O1)C2=CC(=C(C=C2)N3CCOCC3)F 1 and CCN1C(=O)C=C(N(C1=O)CC2=CC=CC=C2C#N)N3CCCC(C3)N 1.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a pyrimidine ring, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to nervous system disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and a benzene ring (-C6H5), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. The first example in the dataset meets this criterion and has been labeled as having the potential for such effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) and a conjugated double bond system, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. This rule applies to the second example in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it should be considered potentially harmful and may have the ability to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. However, this rule does not apply to any of the examples in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of negatively charged atoms such as oxygen and nitrogen in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system. This rule can be applied to compounds 6, 7, 8, and 9 which contain anionic functional groups like sulfonate or phosphate. These anions can interact with positively charged ions present in the body leading to unwanted reactions.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings have a higher chance of causing adverse effects than those without them. This rule can be applied to compounds 2 and 5 which contain benzene rings. Aromatic rings are known to interact with biological molecules through π-π stacking interactions, which can lead to toxicity.
Rule 3: Compounds containing sulfur-nitrogen bonds may have a lower risk of causing adverse effects compared to those containing only sulfur or nitrogen. This rule can be applied to compounds 3 and 4 which contain thiazole and triazole rings respectively. Sulfur-nitrogen bonds are less polar than sulfur-oxygen or nitrogen-oxygen bonds, making them less likely to interact with other molecules in the body.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the central nervous system.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to interact with biological systems and disrupt normal cellular processes. They can also affect the permeability of cell membranes, leading to neurotoxicity or other adverse effects.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings and halogen atoms may exhibit neurotoxic effects due to their ability to bind to receptors in the brain.
Explanation: Aromatic rings are often found in neurotransmitters and other biologically active compounds, while halogen atoms can enhance the lipophilicity of a compound and promote its penetration into the CNS.
Rule 3: Compounds with a high degree of symmetry or planarity may be more likely to cause adverse effects than those with irregular structures.
Explanation: Symmetric molecules tend to have lower conformational flexibility and may be less able to adapt to changes in their environment. Planar structures can facilitate π-π stacking interactions between adjacent molecules, which can lead to aggregation and other types of toxicity.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to nervous system disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) separated by one or more carbon atoms, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. The first example in the dataset satisfies this rule.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (-Cl) bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to a double bond between two carbon atoms, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. The third example in the dataset satisfies this rule.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. The last example in the dataset satisfies this rule.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, phosphate or nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to disrupt normal cellular processes and lead to toxicity. They can also bind to receptors in the brain and affect neurotransmission, leading to neurological symptoms.
Rule 2: Compounds containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also be associated with increased risk of neurotoxicity due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and interact with neuronal receptors.
Explanation: Aromatic compounds are often lipophilic and can easily penetrate cell membranes, including those of neurons. Conjugated double bonds can enhance the reactivity of a compound and facilitate interactions with biological molecules.
Rule 3: Molecules with molecular weights greater than 500 Daltons or with multiple chiral centers may have reduced bioavailability and lower likelihood of crossing the blood-brain barrier, resulting in decreased neurotoxic potential.
Explanation: Larger molecules may require active transport mechanisms to enter cells, which can limit their distribution throughout the body. Multiple chiral centers can increase the complexity of a molecule and make it more difficult to synthesize or isolate.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of bromine atom in the structure, then it may lead to adverse effects on the nervous system. The first compound has two bromine atoms and hence it belongs to this category.
Rule 2: If there is a presence of carbonyl group (C=O) in the structure, then it may also lead to adverse effects on the nervous system. The second compound has one such group and hence it belongs to this category.
Rule 3: If there is a presence of nitrogen atom in the structure, then it may be responsible for causing adverse effects on the nervous system. The third compound has a nitrogen atom present in its structure which makes it belong to this category.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to nervous system disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) and a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. This rule applies to molecules #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25, #26, #27, #28, #29, #30, #31, #32, #33, #34, #35, #36, #37, #38, #39, #40, #41, #42, #43, #44, #45, #46, #47, #48, #49, #50, #51, #52, #53, #54,

Rule 3: If the molecule contains a bromine atom (-Br) and a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. The third example in the dataset meets this criterion.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided by the given dataset and should be used as a starting point for further investigation rather than definitive conclusions.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) and double bonds (C=C) in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: These functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to negative consequences. For example, the carbonyl group present in the second molecule can form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues in proteins, altering their structure and function. Similarly, the double bond present in the first molecule can react with free radicals or other reactive species, leading to oxidative stress and cellular damage.
Rule 2: Molecules containing heterocyclic rings such as pyridine, pyrimidine, and imidazole have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: Heterocyclic rings contain both carbon and nitrogen atoms, making them more polar and capable of interacting with biological molecules. They also possess unique chemical properties that can affect protein folding and enzyme activity, leading to negative consequences. For instance, the third molecule contains a pyrazole ring, which has been shown to inhibit acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme involved in neurotransmitter metabolism.
Rule 3: Molecules with a high degree of lipophilicity tend to cross the blood-brain barrier more easily and cause adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: Lipophilic molecules can dissolve in cell membranes and interfere with membrane fluidity, ion channel function, and receptor binding. They can also accumulate in tissues and cause toxic effects over time. For example, the last molecule contains a long chain fatty acid ester, which is highly lipophilic and can penetrate the brain tissue.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the nervous system. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 and 5.
Rule 2: A compound containing a carbonyl group (C=O) may have a higher likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system if it also contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 6 and 7.
Rule 3: Molecules containing a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) may be associated with adverse effects on the nervous system. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 8 and 9.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to nervous system disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2) or a nitrate group (-ONO2), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. The first two molecules in the dataset contain these groups and they both have labels of 1, indicating their association with such adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-CH=CH-), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. This structural feature is present in the third molecule in the dataset, which has a label of 1.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a carbamate group (-NH-CO-O-), then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to nervous system disorders. This structural feature is present in the fifth molecule in the dataset, which has a label of 1.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided by this small dataset and should be treated as preliminary suggestions only. Further research and analysis would be needed to confirm their validity and applicability to other types of molecules and conditions.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects on the nervous system. For example, molecules containing nitro groups or halogenated aromatic rings have been shown to be associated with neurological toxicity. Therefore, if a molecule contains such functional groups, it should be labeled as having a high likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Rule 2: The molecular weight and hydrophobicity of a molecule may also play a role in determining its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and affect the central nervous system. Molecules with higher molecular weights and lower hydrophilicity tend to have poorer brain penetration and may be less likely to cause adverse effects on the nervous system. Therefore, if a molecule has a low molecular weight and high lipophilicity, it should be labeled as having a moderate likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system.
Rule 3: The structure of a molecule may also influence its ability to interact with specific receptors or enzymes within the nervous system. For example, some molecules may act as agonists or antagonists at neurotransmitter receptors, leading to altered signaling and potentially harmful effects. Therefore, if a molecule has a known mechanism of action involving interaction with specific targets within the nervous system, it should be labeled as having a high likelihood of causing adverse effects on the nervous system.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: Sulfonamides and nitro compounds are known to be neurotoxic and can cause seizures, hallucinations, and other neurological symptoms. These groups may interfere with normal brain function by blocking the action of certain neurotransmitters or by causing oxidative stress in neurons.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a benzene ring with a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to one of its carbon atoms, then it may also have adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: Phenols such as acetaminophen and aspirin are known to be analgesic and antipyretic drugs but can also cause headaches, dizziness, nausea, and other neurological symptoms at high doses. The hydroxyl group may interact with receptors in the central nervous system and alter their function.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a conjugated system of double bonds between two aromatic rings, then it may also have adverse effects on the nervous system.
Explanation: Compounds like beta-carotene and retinol (vitamin A) contain this type of conjugation and are essential for proper brain function. However, excessive intake or exposure to these compounds can lead to neurotoxicity due to their pro-oxidant properties.
