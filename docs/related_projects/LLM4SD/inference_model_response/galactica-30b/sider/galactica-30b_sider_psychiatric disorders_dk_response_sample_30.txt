Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules 7, 8, and 9 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules 10 and 11 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules 12 and 13 in the dataset.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) in its structure, then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule by having both groups present.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a conjugated system of double bonds, then it may also have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. The second molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule by having both groups present.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) and a benzene ring, then it may also have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. The third molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule by having both groups present.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a nitro group (-NO2) present in the structure of the molecule, then it may have potential side effects on psychiatric disorders. The presence of this functional group may increase the reactivity and toxicity of the compound. Therefore, molecules containing such groups should be avoided or used with caution for therapeutic purposes.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a phosphorus atom bonded to three carbon atoms, as in the case of the third SMILES string provided, then it may also exhibit potential side effects on psychiatric disorders due to its high reactivity. This type of molecular structure may interact with other biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions.
Rule 3: If the molecule has a negatively charged ion, such as a carboxylate anion (-COO-) or a sulfonate anion (-SO3-), attached to a benzene ring, as in the cases of the thirteenth and sixteenth SMILES strings respectively, then it may potentially bind to receptors in the brain and affect mood regulation. Such compounds should be carefully evaluated before being considered for use in therapy.

================================



================================

Based on the given dataset and labels, here are three possible rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders based on its structure or properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. The first molecule in the dataset contains such a group and has a label of 1, indicating that it does have these side effects. However, this rule alone would not be sufficient to make a definitive prediction since there are many other molecules in the dataset without sulfonyl groups but still having label 1.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. The second molecule in the dataset contains such a group and has a label of 1, supporting this hypothesis. Again, this rule alone cannot provide a definite answer either.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl), then it may have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. The third molecule in the dataset contains one Cl atom and has a label of 1, providing some support for this rule. This rule is more specific than the previous two and could potentially be useful for predicting which molecules are more likely to have these side effects.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular formula contains sulfur and nitrogen atoms, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in psychiatric disorders. The presence of these elements may indicate the potential for interaction with neurotransmitters or other biological molecules involved in mental health.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains chlorine atoms, then it also has a high probability of causing adverse effects in psychiatric disorders. Chlorine is often used as a substituent in drug design due to its ability to increase lipophilicity and improve membrane permeability. However, excessive exposure to chlorinated compounds can lead to neurological damage and cognitive impairment.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains conjugated double bonds, then it has a moderate probability of causing adverse effects in psychiatric disorders. Conjugated double bonds can facilitate electron transfer reactions within the body, which may affect neurotransmitter function or other physiological processes relevant to mental health.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular formula contains chlorine and has at least one aromatic ring, then it is likely to have adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. The given SMILES string C1=CC(=C(C(=C1)Cl)C=NN=C(N)N)Cl satisfies this rule as it contains both chlorine and an aromatic ring.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or its derivatives such as sulfonylurea (-CONHC(=O)SO2NR2R3 where R2 and R3 are alkyl groups), then it may be associated with adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. The given SMILES strings CC(C(=O)N1C2CCCCC2CC1C(=O)O)NC(CCC3=CC=CC=C3)C(=O)O and OP(=O)([O-])[O-].[K+].[K+] satisfy this rule since they contain sulfonamide and sulfonylurea functional groups respectively.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains amide group (-CONHR- where R is any organic group) followed by a carbonyl group (-C=O) in the same chain, then it may be associated with adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. The given SMILES string C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)SCC(=O)NCC(=O)NCC(=O)NCC(=O)O satisfies this rule as it contains two consecutive amide groups separated by a carbonyl

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders based on its structure and properties:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a barium ion (Ba+2) or calcium ion (Ca+2), then it may have potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule is based on the fact that these ions play important roles in various biological processes within the body, including those related to mental health. However, this rule should be taken with caution as there may be other factors that contribute to the development of such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom (Cl) bonded to a carbon atom, then it may not have potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule is based on the observation that many drugs containing Cl atoms do not have any known side effects related to psychiatric disorders.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom (F) attached to a benzene ring, then it may have potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule is based on the fact that fluorinated compounds have been shown to exhibit different chemical and physical properties compared to their non-fluorinated counterparts, which can lead to altered biological activities. While further research would be needed to confirm this association, this rule provides a starting point for investigating the relationship between molecular structures and potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of the functional group "-COOH" in a compound may indicate its potential for causing adverse effects on mental health. This rule can be applied to molecules such as C[N+]1(C2CC(CC1C3C2O3)OC(=O)C(CO)C4=CC=CC=C4)C and CC(C(=O)N1C2CCCCC2CC1C(=O)O)NC(CCC3=CC=CC=C3)C(=O)O.
Rule 2: A compound containing the functional group "-NO2" may also have the potential to cause adverse effects on mental health. This rule can be applied to molecules such as COC1=NC(=NC2=C1N=CN2[C@H]3[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O3)CO)O)O)N and CCC(C)(CC1=CC=CC=C1)N.
Rule 3: Compounds containing aromatic rings or heterocyclic structures may also pose a risk of causing adverse effects on mental health. This rule can be applied to molecules such as C1NN=C(N1)c1ccc(cc1)Br and O=P(Nc1ccccc1Oc1ccccc1)(OP(=O)(O)c1ccccc1)n1ccccc1.

Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a benzene ring, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. The second example in the dataset satisfies this rule by having both groups present.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom (-F) attached to a carbon atom, then it may not have the potential to cause adverse effects related to psychiatric disorders. This is because fluorinated compounds often have improved pharmacokinetic properties compared to their non-fluorinated counterparts. The last example in the dataset does not satisfy this rule since there is no fluorine atom present.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to psychiatric disorders based on its structure and properties:

These two examples both contain a bromine atom which may contribute to their side effect activity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in the para position relative to a carbonyl group, it is less likely to have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "CCCCCCCCC1=CC=C(C=C1)CCC(CO)(CO)N.Cl". The presence of this specific functional group may reduce the likelihood of side effects due to its electron withdrawing nature.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group attached to a benzene ring, it is also less

================================

Rule 1: The presence of chlorine atom in the structure may indicate potential for causing adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings C1C(=C(N2C(S1)C(C2=O)NC(=O)C(C3=CC=CC=C3)N)C(=O)O)Cl and CCC1C(C(C(C(=O)C(CC(C(C(C(C(C(=O)O1)C)OC2CC(C(C(O2)C)O)(C)OC)C)OC3C(C(CC(O3)C)N(C)C)OC(=O)CCC(=O)OCC)(C)O)C)C)O)(C)O.
Rule 2: The absence of bromine or iodine atoms in the structure may indicate low likelihood of causing adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings CC1=CC(=C(C(=C1NC(=O)CN(CC(=O)O)CC(=O)O)C)Br)C and COCCCN1CCC(CC1)NC(=O)C2=CC(=C(C3=C2OCC3)N)Cl.
Rule 3: The presence of conjugated double bonds in the structure may increase the probability of causing adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=C(N3C=C(C=CC3=N2)C)CC(=O)N(C)C and CN1CCN(CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-].

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to psychiatric disorders:

These two examples both contain a bromine atom which may contribute to their side effect activity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in the para position relative to a carbonyl group, it is less likely to have side effects related to psychiatric disorders. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "CCCCCCCCC1=CC=C(C=C1)CCC(CO)(CO)N.Cl". The presence of this specific functional group may reduce the likelihood of side effects due to its electron withdrawing nature.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group attached to a benzene ring, it is also less

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a cyano group (-CN) and a benzene ring (-C6H5), then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in relation to psychiatric disorders. The given SMILES string CN(C)CCC1=CNC2=C1C=C(C=C2)CN3C=NC=N3 matches this rule.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) attached to a phenyl ring (-C6H5), then it may have some potential for causing adverse effects due to its ability to bind to biological receptors. The given SMILES string C1COCC2=C1N=CC3=N/C(=C\4/C=CON4)/N=C23 matches this rule.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a sodium ion (Na+) bonded to a carboxylate group (-COO-), then it may be able to cross the blood-brain barrier and potentially cause adverse effects on the central nervous system. The given SMILES string CC(C1=CC2=C(C=C1)C=C(C=C2)OC)C(=O)[O-].[Na+] matches this rule.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to psychiatric disorders:

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to psychiatric disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure CN(C)C/C=C/C(=O)NC1=C(C=C2C(=C1)C(=NC=N2)NC3=CC(=C(C=C3)F)Cl)O[C@@H]4CCOC4, then it is likely to have side-effect activity related to psychiatric disorders. This rule is based on the fact that this particular substructure is present in one of the molecules labeled as having such activity and absent from all those without it. However, it's important to note that this rule should only be used as a starting point for further analysis and experimentation, and not as a definitive predictor of side-effect activity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure C[C@@]1(C2C[C@H]3[C@@H](C(=O)C(=C([C@]3(C(=O)C2=C(C4=C1C=CC=C4O)O)O)O)C(=O)NCNCCCC[C@@H](C(=O)O)N)N(C)C)O, then it is unlikely to have side-effect activity related to psychiatric

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) in the first molecule suggests that it could have some potential for causing adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. Similarly, the presence of a zinc atom in the second molecule indicates that it might be toxic and potentially harmful if ingested or inhaled.
Rule 2: The structure of a molecule plays a crucial role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects. For instance, the third molecule contains a cyclopropane ring, which is known to be highly reactive and may contribute to its toxicity. Additionally, the fourth molecule has a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a benzene ring, which is often associated with mutagenicity and carcinogenicity.
Rule 3: The number and position of substituents on a molecule can also affect its potential to cause adverse effects. For example, the fifth molecule has two carbonyl groups (-C=O) connected by a double bond, which makes it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack and may lead to further reactions that could result in adverse effects. Moreover, the sixth molecule has a sulfur-containing substituent, which is often associated with neurotoxicity due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a benzene ring in a compound increases its likelihood of causing adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 and 7.
Rule 2: A compound containing a nitro group (-NO2) has a higher chance of exhibiting adverse effects than one without it. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 8 and 9.
Rule 3: Compounds with a sulfonyl group (-SO2R) have a lower risk of causing adverse effects compared to those without it. This rule can be used for molecules labeled as 10 and 11.

================================

Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or its derivatives such as sulfonylurea (-CONHC(=O)SO2NR2R3 where R2 and R3 are alkyl groups), then it may be associated with adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. The given SMILES strings CC(C(=O)N1C2CCCCC2CC1C(=O)O)NC(CCC3=CC=CC=C3)C(=O)O and OP(=O)([O-])[O-].[K+].[K+] satisfy this rule since they contain sulfonamide and sulfonylurea functional groups respectively.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains amide group (-CONHR- where R is any organic group) followed by a carbonyl group (-C=O) in the same chain, then it may be associated with adverse effects on psychiatric disorders. The given SMILES string C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)SCC(=O)NCC(=O)NCC(=O)NCC(=O)O satisfies this rule as it contains two consecutive amide groups separated by a carbonyl

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on mental health.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to interact with biological systems and disrupt normal cellular processes, leading to various types of toxicity including neurological damage. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their potential to cause adverse effects on mental health.
Rule 2: Compounds with a high degree of symmetry or planarity may also exhibit increased risk of adverse effects on mental health.
Explanation: Such structures may facilitate intermolecular interactions and promote aggregation, which could lead to toxic effects on cells and tissues. For example, compounds with symmetrical aromatic rings or polycyclic structures have been shown to induce neurotoxicity through this mechanism.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a compound's carbon chain may also affect its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and exert neurotoxic effects.
Explanation: Longer chains and more complex structures may require additional metabolic steps to break down and eliminate from the body, increasing the likelihood of accumulation and toxicity in sensitive organs like the brain. Additionally, certain structural features such as branching or cyclization may hinder transport across the blood-brain barrier, further reducing the compound's potential to reach target sites within the central nervous system.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular formula contains sulfur and nitrogen atoms, then it has a high probability of causing adverse effects in psychiatric disorders. The presence of these elements may indicate the potential for interaction with neurotransmitters or other biological molecules involved in mental health.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains chlorine atoms, then it also has a high probability of causing adverse effects in psychiatric disorders. Chlorine is often used as a substituent in drug design due to its ability to increase lipophilicity and improve membrane permeability. However, excessive exposure to chlorinated compounds can lead to neurological damage and cognitive impairment.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains conjugated double bonds, then it has a moderate probability of causing adverse effects in psychiatric disorders. Conjugated double bonds can facilitate electron transfer reactions within the body, which may affect neurotransmitter function or other physiological processes relevant to mental health.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on psychiatric disorders.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to interact with biological systems and disrupt normal functioning, which could lead to negative consequences. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their potential risks before being used in therapy.
Rule 2: A compound with a heterocyclic ring structure may also increase the risk of causing adverse effects on psychiatric disorders.
Explanation: Heterocyclic rings are often associated with increased reactivity and toxicity due to their unique chemical properties. Therefore, compounds containing this type of structural feature should be treated with caution when considering their use in therapy.
Rule 3: Compounds with a high degree of lipophilicity may have a higher likelihood of crossing the blood-brain barrier and affecting central nervous system function.
Explanation: This property allows molecules to easily penetrate cell membranes and access intracellular targets, including those within the brain. Therefore, compounds with high lipophilicities should be closely monitored for any potential neurological side effects.
