Rule 1: If there is a presence of sulfur in the molecular structure, then it may have potential side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The given SMILES string contains a sulfonamide group which is known for its antimicrobial property but has been associated with teratogenic effects when taken during pregnancy. Therefore, this rule suggests that molecules containing sulfur should be avoided or used cautiously while pregnant women.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains metal ions such as calcium, sodium, or iodine, they may also pose some risks to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. However, more research needs to be done to determine their specific effects. This rule suggests that caution should be exercised when using these types of compounds during pregnancy.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains halogen atoms like chlorine or fluorine, they may increase the risk of birth defects if taken during pregnancy. These elements can cross the placenta and affect fetal development. Therefore, this rule suggests that molecules containing halogens should be avoided or used cautiously while pregnant women.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as "C=O" or "C#N", then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule is based on the fact that these functional groups are commonly found in drugs that are known to cause adverse reactions during pregnancy.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule is based on the fact that some studies have shown that exposure to certain halogenated compounds during pregnancy can lead to birth defects or other health problems.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule is based on the fact that some drugs containing sulfonyl groups are known to cross the placenta and affect fetal development.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The presence of these functional groups in a compound indicates its ability to cross the placenta and affect fetal development. Therefore, such compounds should be avoided if possible during pregnancy.
Rule 2: If a compound has a quinazoline ring system, then it may also have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Quinazolines are known to act as antagonists for various receptors involved in reproductive functions; therefore, their use during pregnancy must be carefully evaluated.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a halogen atom (such as chlorine or bromine) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may potentially interact with estrogen receptors and disrupt hormonal balance. Such compounds should be avoided during pregnancy due to their potential teratogenic effects on the fetus.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The first example in the dataset contains both groups and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may also have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.

Rule 2: If there is any occurrence of the SMILES string CC[C@@H]1[C@@]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)[C@@H](C[C@@]([C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)O1)C)OC2CC(C(C(O2)C)O)(C)OC)C)OC3C(C(CC(O3)C)N(C)C)O)(C)OC)C)C)O)(C)O in the molecular structure, then it may also have potential side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 3: If there is any occurrence of the SMILES string C(CCCC(=O)O)CCCC(=O)O or CO[C@@H]1[C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](O[C@@H]1C(=O)[O-])O

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as "-NO2" or "-COOH", then it may have potential side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, the first molecule has a nitro group (-NO2) which may affect these conditions.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a heterocyclic ring system, especially those containing nitrogen atoms, then it may also have potential side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For instance, the third molecule has a pyrimidine ring which may contribute to its toxicity.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains multiple conjugated double bonds, then it may also have potential side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule can be applied to molecules labeled as either 0 or 1 in the given dataset. For example, the sixth molecule has two conjugated double bonds between carbon atoms C8 and C9, which may increase its reactivity towards biological systems.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having no such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) conjugated with an alkene or alkyne group, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The second molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has also been labeled as having no such side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrile group (-CN) adjacent to an aromatic ring, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The third molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having no such side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure "CCN(CC1=CC=NC=C1)C(=O)C(CO)C2=CC=CC=C2" or "CCCCCOC(=O)NC1=NC(=O)N(C=C1F)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)C)O)O", then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure "CN1C(NC2=CC(=C(C=C2S1(=O)=O)S(=O)(=O)N)Cl)CSCC(F)(F)F", then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains the substructure "CC1=C(C=C(C=C1)N2C(=O)C(=C(N2)C)N/N=C/3\C=CC=C(C3=O)C4=CC(=CC=C4)C(=O)O)C" or "C1=C2C(=CC(=C1Cl)S(=O)(=O)N)S(=O)(=O)N=CN2", then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Note that these rules are based solely on the provided dataset and may not be applicable in all cases. It's important to consult medical professionals before taking any medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have potential side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The presence of this functional group in the structure may increase its reactivity and ability to interact with biological systems.
Rule 2: If a compound has a carbonyl group (-C=O) connected to an aromatic ring through a double bond or conjugated system, then it may also have potential side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This functional group can form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues in proteins, which can affect their function and stability.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or fluorine bonded to an aromatic ring, then it may be less likely to have side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Halogen atoms can increase the hydrophobicity of a compound, making it more difficult for it to penetrate cell membranes and interact with biological targets.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfhydryl group (-SH) or a disulfide bond (-SS-), then it may have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The presence of these functional groups in a molecule can affect its reactivity and binding ability, which could lead to negative consequences for the mother and fetus.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains iodine atoms, then it may also have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Iodine is essential for fetal development, but excessive intake or exposure to iodine can disrupt thyroid function and lead to developmental abnormalities.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains fluorine atoms, then it may not have any significant side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Fluorine is commonly found in pharmaceuticals and is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy. However, more research is needed to fully understand the impact of fluorinated compounds on maternal and fetal health.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as "-COOH" or "-OH", then it may have potential side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The presence of these groups indicates that the compound could be acidic in nature, which could affect the pH balance of the body during pregnancy.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure has a high degree of conjugation, i.e., multiple double bonds or aromatic rings connected together, then it may also have potential side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Conjugation increases the stability of the molecule but also makes it more reactive towards other molecules. This reactivity could lead to unwanted interactions within the body, potentially causing harm.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2), then it should be labeled as having potential side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Nitro compounds are known to be toxic and can cause damage to DNA and proteins if they interact with them. They can also interfere with oxygen transport in the blood, leading to tissue hypoxia.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any occurrence of the SMILES string CC[C@H](C)[C@@H](C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(=O)O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(=O)O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC(C)C)C(=O)O)NC(=O)[C@H](CCC(=O)O)NC(=O)[C@H](CCC(=O)O)NC(=O)[C@H](CC3=CC=CC=C3)NC(=O)[C@H](CC(=O)O)NC(=O)CNC(=O)[C@H](CC(=O)N)NC(=O)CNC(=O)CNC(=O)CNC(=O)CNC(=O)CNC(=O)[C@@H]4CCCN4C(=O)[C@H](CCCNC(=N)N)NC(=O)[C@@H]5CCCN5C(=O)[C@@H](CC6=CC=CC=C6)N in the compound's structure,

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-), it may have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions. The presence of this functional group in certain drugs such as sulfasalazine and sulfamethoxazole has been linked to reproductive toxicity and developmental abnormalities in animals. Therefore, molecules containing this group should be carefully evaluated for their safety during pregnancy.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may also have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions. Nitro compounds are known to be toxic and can cause birth defects when exposed to the developing fetus. Therefore, molecules containing this group should be avoided or used with caution during pregnancy.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), it may have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions. Carboxylic acids can cross the placenta and affect fetal development by disrupting normal metabolic processes. Therefore, molecules containing this group should be avoided or used with caution during pregnancy.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a functional group such as "-COOH" or "-OH", then it may have potential side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule can be applied to compounds 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The first molecule in the dataset contains a sulfonyl group and has been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a disulfide bond (-SS-), it may also have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The second molecule in the dataset contains a disulfide bond and has been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains both a sulfonyl group and a disulfide bond, it may have even greater potential for causing side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule combines Rules 1 and 2 into one. The third molecule in the dataset contains both a sulfonyl group and a disulfide bond and has been labeled as having potential side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure "CCN(CC1=CC=NC=C1)C(=O)C(CO)C2=CC=CC=C2" or "CS(=O)(=O)C1=CC(=C(C=C1)C(=O)NC2=CC(=C(C=C2)Cl)C3=CC=CC=N3)Cl" or "CCCS(=O)(=O)NC1=C(C(=C(C=C1)F)C(=O)C2=CNC3=NC=C(C=C23)C4=CC=C(C=C4)Cl)F" or "C1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=NC(C(=O)NC3=C2C=C(C=C3)Cl)C(=O)O" or "C1=CN=CC=C1N" or "N#[N+][O-]" or "C[C@]12CCC3[C@H]([C@@H]1CC[C@@H]2C(=O)NC4=C(C=CC(=C4)C(F)(F)F)C(F)(F)F)CC[

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a functional group such as "-COOH" or "-CHO" which can react with biological molecules like proteins or enzymes, then there is a high chance of causing adverse effects in pregnant women, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The presence of these groups may lead to interactions between the drug and other substances present in the body, resulting in unwanted reactions. Therefore, it is important to avoid using drugs containing these functional groups during pregnancy if possible.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains halogen atoms like fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, they can interfere with the normal functioning of cells by altering their chemical properties. These halogens can also affect protein folding and disrupt cell signaling pathways. Hence, it is advisable to avoid using drugs containing halogen atoms during pregnancy unless necessary.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a nitro group (-NO2), it can be toxic and carcinogenic. Nitro compounds can interact with DNA and cause mutations leading to various health problems including cancer. Therefore, it is essential to use drugs containing this group with caution especially during pregnancy.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The first example in the dataset contains both groups and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may also have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The second example in the dataset contains this group and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an alkene group (-C=C-), then it may also have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This structural feature is present in several examples in the dataset, including the third one which has been labeled as having such side effects.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains bromine atoms, it may have potential side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The presence of bromine in the chemical compound indicates its ability to cross the placental barrier and affect fetal development. Therefore, molecules containing bromine should be avoided or used with caution during pregnancy.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure has a carbonyl group (C=O), it may also have potential side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Carbonyl groups can react with other functional groups present in the body, leading to toxic reactions. Hence, molecules having carbonyl groups must be used cautiously while pregnant.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains fluorine atom, it may not have any significant impact on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Fluorine is a highly electronegative element that does not react easily with other elements. However, if there are multiple fluorine atoms present in the same molecule, they may interact with each other, causing unexpected reactions. Therefore, fluorinated compounds should only be used after careful evaluation of their safety profile.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The first example in the dataset contains both groups and has been labeled as having such side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds between carbon atoms, including at least one carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may also have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule applies to the second example in the dataset, which contains a cyano group (-CN) instead of a carbonyl group but still has the same conjugated system.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine) attached to a carbon atom, then it may not have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule applies to the last two examples in the dataset, which contain either fluorine or chlorine atoms and have been labeled as not having such side effects.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), it may have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions. This rule applies to molecules 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, it may also have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions. This rule applies to molecules 2, 3, and 4 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions. This rule applies to molecule 5 in the dataset.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the limited information provided by this small dataset and should be used cautiously until further research can confirm their validity.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as nitro groups or aromatic rings in a molecule may increase its potential for causing adverse effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule can be inferred from the first two molecules listed above, which contain these functional groups but have been labeled as having no association with these conditions.
Rule 2: The absence of certain functional groups such as carbonyl groups or double bonds in a molecule may decrease its potential for causing adverse effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule can be inferred from the third molecule listed above, which contains all of these functional groups but has also been labeled as having no association with these conditions.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule's structure may also play a role in determining its potential for causing adverse effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Longer chains of carbon atoms or more complex structures may make it easier for the molecule to interact with biological systems and potentially cause harm. However, this rule should be considered tentative until further research can be conducted on a larger sample of molecules.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group called isocyanate (-N=C=O), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The first molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a functional group called nitroso (-NO), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The second molecule in the dataset contains this functional group and has also been labeled as having potential side effects.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a functional group called carboxylic acid (-COOH), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The presence of these functional groups in a compound can increase its toxicity and affect various body systems including the reproductive system. For example, sulfonamides are known to cross the placenta and can cause birth defects when taken by pregnant women. Nitro compounds also have teratogenic effects and can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, and other developmental abnormalities. Therefore, molecules containing these functional groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety during pregnancy.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Halogen atoms can alter the chemical and physical properties of a compound and affect its biological activity. For instance, some halogenated hydrocarbons such as trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are known to cause reproductive and developmental problems in animals and humans. Therefore, molecules containing halogen atoms should be tested for their potential toxic effects on the fetus and newborn baby.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring such as pyridine or pyrimidine, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Nitrogen-containing heterocycles are commonly found in drugs and pesticides and can interact with various biomolecules leading to toxic effects. For example, pyridines are known to disrupt fetal development and cause birth defects in animals. Pyrimidines

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "CC(=O)OC1(C(CC2C1(CC(C3(C2CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC43C)F)O)C)C)C(=O)CCl" or "CCCCCN=C(N)NN/C=C/1\C=NC2=C1C=C(C=C2)CO".
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds between carbon atoms, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "CCC12CCC3C(C1CCC2(C#C)O)CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34" or "CC1=CC(=CC(=C1)OCC2CNC(=O)O2)C".
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a negatively charged oxygen atom bonded to two carbon atoms in a linear arrangement, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom bonded to a carbon atom in a six-membered ring structure, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The first molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule by having a chlorine atom attached to one of the carbon atoms in its benzene ring.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to two other nitrogen atoms in a five-membered ring structure, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The second molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule by having a pyrazole ring structure.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a carbonyl group (a double bond between a carbon atom and an oxygen atom) conjugated with another double bond or a triple bond, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The third molecule in the dataset satisfies this rule by having a dienone moiety.

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to an aromatic ring, then it may have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions. The first example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a nitro group connected to a benzene ring. Therefore, we labeled it as 1.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a chlorine atom bonded to an aromatic ring, then it may have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions. The third example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a chlorine atom bonded to a pyridine ring. Therefore, we labeled it as 1.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a carbonyl group (-C=O) adjacent to an aromatic ring, then it may have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions. The seventh example in the dataset satisfies this rule as it contains a carbonyl group next to a naphthalene ring. Therefore, we labeled it as 1.
It's important to note that these rules are just suggestions and should not be used as the only criteria for predicting side effects. It's always best to consult medical professionals before taking any medication during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of functional groups such as -COOH or -OH in the molecular structure, then it may lead to potential toxicity issues during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The molecule may interfere with normal metabolic processes leading to adverse effects on the fetus or newborn infant. Therefore, molecules containing these functional groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: Molecules containing aromatic rings may also pose safety concerns due to their ability to bind to receptors in the body and disrupt normal physiological functions. These types of compounds should be used cautiously during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 3: Compounds containing nitrogen atoms may have toxic effects on fetal development depending on the type of substitution on the nitrogen atom. For example, molecules containing primary amines may cross the placenta and affect fetal growth and development while secondary or tertiary amines may have less severe effects. Therefore, careful consideration must be given when using molecules containing nitrogen atoms during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a chlorine atom attached to a carbon atom bonded to two oxygen atoms in a chain or ring structure, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings starting with "C" followed by one or more "c" characters, ending with ".Cl", such as COC(=O)ccc(=O)cn.Cl, Cccn.Cl, CC1(N=C(N=C(N1OCCCOC2=CC(=C(C=C2Cl)Cl)Cl)N)N)C.Cl, etc.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to four carbon atoms in a chain or ring structure, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings containing the substring "C1NN=C(Nc2ccccc2)C(C)(C)Oc3ccccc3", such as CCCnnnCC1CNN(C2=CC=CC=C2F)C1, c1nc(C)n(C)c1C1ON=C(Cn2ccccc2)C(C)(C)Oc3ccccc31, etc.
Rule 3: If

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a phosphorus atom bonded to two oxygen atoms in a phosphate group, then it may have side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The presence of this functional group suggests that the molecule may interact with biological systems in ways that could harm the developing fetus or mother during childbirth.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a fluorine atom attached to one of the carbon atoms in a cyclopropane ring, then it may have side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This functional group is often found in synthetic chemicals that are known to be toxic to living organisms. It is possible that these types of molecules could interfere with normal fetal development or affect maternal health during pregnancy and after delivery.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbonyl group, then it may have side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This functional group is commonly found in amino acids, which are essential building blocks for protein synthesis. Amino acids play important roles in fetal growth and development, so any disruption to their metabolism could have negative consequences for both the mother and child.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure "C1=CC(=CN=C1)C(=O)NCCO[N+](=O)[O-]" or "CC(C(=O)N1C2CCCCC2CC1C(=O)O)NC(CCC3=CC=CC=C3)C(=O)O", then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Explanation: These two molecules contain functional groups that are commonly found in drugs that can cause birth defects or other adverse effects during pregnancy. The first molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) which can interact with DNA and cause mutations, while the second molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) which can interfere with normal cell function. Both of these groups have been linked to teratogenic effects in animal studies.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure "C1=CC(=CC=C1N)S(=O)(=O)N" or "CC(=O)NCCC1=CC=CC2=C1C=C(C=C2)OC", then it may not have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Explanation: These two molecules do not contain any known harmful substructures that could cause adverse effects during pregnancy. The first molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) which is commonly found in antibiotics but is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy. The second molecule contains a carbamate group (-NHCO-) which is also generally considered safe for use during pregnancy.


================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The presence of these functional groups in a compound can increase its toxicity and affect various body systems including the reproductive system. For example, the molecule CCOC1=CC=CC=C1OCCN[C@@H](C)CC2=CC(=C(C=C2)OC)S(=O)(=O)N.Cl contains both a sulfonamide group and a chlorine atom, which may contribute to its toxic effects. Therefore, this rule suggests that molecules containing such functional groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal periods.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule is based on the fact that some compounds containing a cyano group have been associated with developmental toxicity and teratogenicity. For instance, the molecule CCNC(=O)C1CCCN1C(=O)C(CCCN=C(N)N)NC(=O)C(CC(C)C)NC(=O)C(COC(C)(C)C)NC(=O)C(CC2=CC=C(C=C2)O)NC(=O)C(CO)NC(=O)C(CC3=CNC4=CC=CC=C43)NC(=O)C(CC5=CN=CN5)NC(=O)C6CCC(=O)N6 contains a cyano group connected to a carbonyl group through a single bond. Therefore, this rule suggests that molecules containing such structural features should also be carefully evaluated for their safety during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal periods.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a halogen atom (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) bonded to a carbon atom, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Halogen atoms can alter the chemical and physical properties of a compound, leading to changes in its biological activity and toxicity. For example, the molecule CCC(CO)NC(=O)C1CN(C2CC3=CNC4

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains iron atoms or has a functional group such as -COOH, -CONH-, -NHCOCH3, etc., then it may have potential side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Explanation: Iron is essential for fetal development but excessive amounts can lead to oxidative stress and tissue damage. The functional groups mentioned above are commonly found in drugs and chemicals that can cross the placenta and affect fetal health.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a heterocyclic ring system such as pyridine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, etc., then it may have potential side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Explanation: Heterocyclic rings are often present in pharmaceuticals and can interact with biological molecules leading to toxicity. They also tend to be more reactive than their acyclic counterparts due to the presence of multiple bonds.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a long carbon chain or a bulky substituent, then it may have limited penetration into the placental barrier and less likely to cause adverse effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Explanation: Longer chains and bulkier substituents increase the size and hydrophobicity of the molecule, making it less likely to pass through the placental barrier. However, this rule should be used cautiously since some large molecules can still penetrate the placenta and cause harm.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group such as "-COOR" or "-COOH", then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule is based on the fact that these functional groups are commonly found in drugs that are known to cause adverse reactions during pregnancy.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a benzene ring, then it may also have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule is based on the fact that some chemicals containing benzene rings have been shown to cause reproductive toxicity in animals.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a long carbon chain, then it may also have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule is based on the fact that some fatty acids and their derivatives have been shown to cause developmental abnormalities in animal studies.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group called "fluorine" attached to a carbon atom, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The presence of fluorine in a compound can significantly alter its chemical and physical properties, which can affect its biological activity. Fluorine is known to disrupt hormonal balance and has been linked to reproductive toxicity. Therefore, molecules containing fluorine should be carefully evaluated for their potential risks during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal periods.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a negatively charged ion such as "oxide" or "hydroxide" bonded to a carbon atom, then it may also have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. These ions can interact with other molecules in the body and interfere with normal cellular processes. For example, certain types of oxide ions found in tobacco smoke have been shown to damage DNA and increase the risk of birth defects. Therefore, molecules containing these ions should also be evaluated for their potential risks during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal periods.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitrogen atom connected to two carbon atoms through a double bond, then it may also have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This functional group is commonly found in drugs like penicillin and cephalosporin, which are known to cross the placenta and potentially harm the developing fetus. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should be avoided or used with caution during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal periods.

================================

Rule 1: If there is any functional group such as "-NO2" or "-COOH" present in the molecular structure, then it may lead to potential toxicity. This rule applies to molecules labeled as 1 for causing adverse effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. For example, in the first SMILES string, the presence of the nitro group (-NO2) may indicate potential toxicity.
Rule 2: The number of rings in the molecular structure also plays a role in determining its potential toxicity. Molecules containing multiple rings tend to be more toxic than those with fewer rings. Therefore, if a molecule has two or more rings, it should be labeled as 1 for potentially causing adverse effects. For instance, in the second SMILES string, the molecule contains three rings, which increases the likelihood of being toxic.
Rule 3: The presence of certain atoms like silver (Ag) or sodium (Na) in the molecular structure indicates potential toxicity. These elements are known to have adverse effects on human health when present in high concentrations. Therefore, if a molecule contains Ag or Na, it should be labeled as 1 for potentially causing adverse effects. For example, in the last SMILES string, the molecule contains both Ag and Na, indicating potential toxicity.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a functional group such as "[C@H]1[C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@@H](O1)OC[C@@H]2[C@H]([C@@H]([C@H]([C@H](O2)OC[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C=O)O)O)O)O)O)O)O)O)O)O)O" or "CC(C)C[C@H](CC(=O)O)CN" in its structure, then it may have potential side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 2: If a compound has a molecular formula like C[C@@H]1CC[C@@]23CCC(=O)[C@H]2[C@@]1([C@@H](C[C@@]([C@H]([C@@H]3C)O)(C)C=C)OC(=O)CSC4C[C@H]5CC[C@@H](C4)N5C)C, then it may not be harmful during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 3: If a compound has a molecular formula like C[C@@H]1C2C(C(=O)N2C(=C1S[C@H]3C[C@H](NC3)C(=O)N(C)C)C(=O)O)[C@H](C)O.O.O.O, then it may also not be harmful during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. However, further research is needed to confirm this claim.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The presence of these groups in a compound indicates its ability to cross the placenta barrier and affect fetal development. Therefore, such compounds should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure has a carbonyl group (-C=O) conjugated with an aromatic ring, then it may also have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This type of compound can bind to proteins and enzymes, leading to changes in their function and potentially causing harm to the fetus.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a halogen atom (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine), then it may have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Halogen atoms can alter the chemical and physical properties of molecules, making them more reactive and potentially harmful. However, the extent of this risk depends on various factors, including the dose, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (represented by the SMILES string C1=CC=C(C=C1)COC2=CC=C(C=C2)O or CC(COC1=CC=CC=C1)NC(C)C(C2=CC=C(C=C2)O)O), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a disulfide bond (represented by the SMILES string C(C(C(=O)O)S)(C(=O)O)S), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a conjugated ketone group (represented by the SMILES string CCC12CC(=O)C3C(C1CCC2(C(=O)CO)O)CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC34C), then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the given dataset and should be used as guidance only. It's important to consult medical professionals before

================================

Rule 1: If there is any presence of functional groups such as -COOH or -OH in the molecular structure, then it may lead to potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as "0" because they do not have these specific functional groups but still could potentially cause harm if present in high concentrations.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains aromatic rings, such as benzene or pyridine, it may also increase the risk of causing adverse effects on pregnant women, their babies, or both. Therefore, this rule applies to all molecules regardless of their labeling.
Rule 3: The number of carbon atoms in the molecular structure does not necessarily correlate with its ability to cause adverse effects. However, larger molecules tend to be more complex and may contain multiple functional groups that could contribute to toxicity. Therefore, this rule only applies to molecules whose size varies significantly from one another.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains the substructure "CCCC(=O)O" in its SMILES representation, then it may have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by the first two SMILES strings labeled as 0 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains the substructure "NC1=NN=C(C2=C1C(=C(S2)C3=NC(=Nc=c3)C)SS3)C4=CC=CC=C4F" in its SMILES representation, then it may have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by the fourth SMILES string labeled as 0 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains the substructure "C1=CNN=C(C2=C1C(=C(S2)C3=NC(=Nc=n3)C)SSC3)C4=CC=CC=C4F" in its SMILES representation, then it may have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, or perinatal conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by the fifth SMILES string labeled as 0 in the dataset.
Note that these rules are based solely on the provided dataset and

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the substructure "CCOC(=O)C1=CNN2C(=O)C(C(=O)O)C12" or its mirror image, then it may have side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule applies to molecules 1, 9, and 10 in the dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the substructure "CC(C)(C)Nc1cnc(ncc1Oc2ccc(cc2Br)I)N" or its mirror image, then it may have side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule applies to molecule 3 in the dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains the substructure "CCCS(=O)(=O)N1CCN(CC1)C2=CC=C(C=C2)C#N" or its mirror image, then it may have side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule applies to molecule 4 in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of sulfur in the molecular structure, then it may have potential side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The given SMILES strings containing sulfur atoms are CC1=CN=C(C(=C1OC)C)CS(=O)C2=NC3=C(N2)C=C(C=C3)OC 0, CCCSC1=CC2=C(C=C1)N=C(N2)NC(=O)OC 0, C1=NC2=C(N1)C(=S)N=C(N2)N 0, CN(C)NN=C1C(=NC=N1)C(=O)N 0, CCS(=O)(=O)O 0, CNC(C)(C)c1ccc(cc1)NS(=O)(=O)Nc1ccccc1 0, c1nc2c(n1)c(=O)n(C)c2=O 0, COC(=O)Oc1ccc(cc1Br)OS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(cc1)ON 0, CCN(C)Cc1nncn1C(=O)NCCCN1CCCCCC1 0, O=C(Cn1cc(sc2nnc(C)s12)Sc2nnc(C)s12)SCN 0, OC(=O)C1(C)CC(C)(C)OP(=O)(OCC(C)(C)C(=O)O)O1 0, NCC(C)(C)C(=O)NOC(=O)C(C)(C)

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains the SMILES string C1CC1NC2=NC(=NC3=C2N=CN3[C@@H]4C[C@@H](C=C4)CO)N or CC[PH+](CC)CC.CC[PH+](CC)CC.CC(=O)OCC1C(C(C(C(O1)[SH2+])OC(=O)C)OC(=O)C)OC(=O)C.[Au].[Au], then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains the SMILES strings CN(C)CCOC(C1=CC=CC=C1)C2=CC=CC=C2 or CCC1(C(=O)N(C(=O)N1)C)C2=CC=CC=C2, then it may not have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains the SMILES string COCCCN1CCC(CC1)NC(=O)C2=CC(=C(C3=C2OCC3)N)Cl, then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a similar functional group, it may have potential side effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The presence of this group in a compound may interfere with the body's normal functioning, leading to adverse outcomes. Therefore, compounds containing such groups should be avoided if possible.
Rule 2: Compounds containing halogen atoms like chlorine (Cl) or fluorine (F) on their aromatic rings may also pose risks during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. These halogens can easily cross the placental barrier and affect fetal development. Therefore, compounds containing these moieties should be used cautiously during these periods.
Rule 3: If a compound has a negatively charged oxygen atom bonded to two carbon atoms (-C=O-), it may potentially interact with positively charged sodium ions (Na+) present in the human body. This interaction could lead to adverse reactions, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal issues. Therefore, compounds containing such functional groups should be used carefully while pregnant, puerperal, or perinatally.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a functional group such as "-COOH" or "-OH", it may have potential side effects on pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, the first molecule has a "-COOH" group which could potentially interact with biological systems during these critical periods.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a conjugated system consisting of multiple double bonds, it may be associated with negative health outcomes for pregnant women. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For instance, the third molecule has two adjacent double bonds which form a conjugated system. The presence of this structure suggests that the compound may have toxic effects on cells and tissues.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2), it may pose a risk to fetal development if taken during pregnancy. This rule applies to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 in the given dataset. For example, the sixth molecule has a nitro group attached to a benzene ring, which could interfere with normal cell function and lead to developmental abnormalities.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group called "sulfide" or "disulfide", then it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The presence of these groups in a molecule can affect its reactivity and toxicity.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, then it may also have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Halogen atoms can increase the polarity and reactivity of a molecule, which can lead to increased interactions with biological systems.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a conjugated system of double bonds, such as a benzene ring or a chain of alternating single and double bonds, then it may also have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Conjugated systems can increase the stability and reactivity of a molecule, which can lead to increased interactions with biological systems.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions based on its structure:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group called "ketone" or "aldehyde" in conjugation with another double bond, it may have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. The presence of this functional group indicates that the molecule may be able to interact with biological systems in ways that could lead to these types of adverse effects.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a sulfonyl group (SO2R), it may also have potential side effects related to pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This functional group is known to be toxic and can disrupt normal cellular processes.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a nitro group (NO2), it should be considered potentially harmful during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. Nitro groups can react with other molecules in biological systems to form reactive oxygen species, which can damage cells and tissues.
It's important to note that these rules are generalizations and do not take into account all possible factors that could influence the toxicity of a particular compound. Additionally, there may be other structural features that could contribute to the potential side effects of a molecule, but these three rules provide a starting point for evaluating the safety of new compounds.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as phosphate or carboxylate ions in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule can be applied by checking if the SMILES string contains any of these functional groups. For example, in the first SMILES string, the presence of the P(=O)([O-])[O-] group indicates that this compound has a high likelihood of causing adverse effects.
Rule 2: A compound containing conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects during pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. This rule can be applied by checking if the SMILES string contains any of these structural features. For instance, in the second SMILES string, the CC/C=C/CC(=O)N[C@@H](CC1=CC=C(C=C1)O)C(=O)N[C@@H](C)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC(=O)O)C(=O)N[C@@H](C)C(=O)N[C@@H]([C@@H](C)CC)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC2=CC=CC=C2)C(=O)N[C@@H]([C@@H](C)O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC(=O)N)C(=O)N[C@@H](CO)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC3=CC=C(C=C3)O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC
