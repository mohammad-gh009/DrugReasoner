Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to gastrointestinal disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains a functional group called "nitrile" (-CN) or "isocyanate" (-N=C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 7 and 8 in the provided dataset.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 9, 10, 11, and 12 in the provided dataset.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H5) or a naphthalene ring (C10H8), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to molecules numbered 13, 14, and 15 in the provided dataset.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to irritate the stomach lining and lead to nausea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their potential to cause adverse effects on the digestive system.
Rule 2: Compounds with a high degree of lipophilicity tend to accumulate in adipose tissue and may cause adverse effects due to prolonged exposure over time.
Explanation: Highly lipophilic compounds may remain in the body for longer periods of time, leading to chronic toxicity or other long-term health problems. Therefore, compounds with high lipid solubility should be closely monitored for any potential adverse effects.
Rule 3: Compounds with a molecular weight greater than 500 Daltons may have difficulty crossing cell membranes and may require specialized transport mechanisms to enter cells. This could potentially limit their bioavailability and reduce their ability to cause adverse effects.
Explanation: Large molecules may have limited access to target sites within cells, reducing their effectiveness at causing toxic effects. Therefore, compounds with a molecular weight above 500 Daltons should be evaluated cautiously for their potential to cause adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like "-CN" or "-NO2" in the structure of a molecule, then it may lead to adverse effects on the human body. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings starting from line number 7 onwards. For example, in the first SMILES string, the presence of "-CN" and "-NO2" groups makes this molecule potentially harmful for causing gastric problems.
Rule 2: If a molecule has a long carbon chain with multiple rings attached to it, it may also have potential adverse effects due to its high lipophilicity. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings starting from line number 9 onwards. For instance, in the second SMILES string, the presence of a long alkyl chain with two fused benzene rings increases the chances of this molecule being toxic.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it may be associated with adverse reactions such as skin rashes, fevers, and other allergic responses. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings starting from line number 18 onwards. For example, in the fifth SMILES string, the presence of a sulfonamide group makes this molecule highly allergenic.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to gastrointestinal disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains iron atoms and oxygen molecules, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to the first two SMILES strings labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains zinc atoms or iodine atoms, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to the third and fourth SMILES strings labeled as 1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains functional groups such as carbonyl groups, carboxyl groups, or sulfonyl groups, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to the fifth through eighth SMILES strings labeled as 1.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the given dataset and should be used cautiously until further research is conducted.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of a sulfonamide group in a compound may increase its likelihood of causing gastrointestinal disorders as a side effect. This rule can be inferred from the fact that two out of three molecules labeled as 1 contain a sulfonamide group while none of the molecules labeled as 0 do.
Rule 2: A compound containing a carboxylic acid group and an amide group may have a higher chance of causing gastrointestinal disorders if it also contains a benzene ring or a heterocyclic ring. This rule can be inferred from the fact that one molecule labeled as 1 contains both a carboxylic acid group and an amide group along with a benzene ring, while another molecule labeled as 1 contains both groups along with a heterocyclic ring. None of the molecules labeled as 0 contain both these functional groups along with any type of aromatic ring.
Rule 3: A compound containing a nitro group may have a lower chance of causing gastrointestinal disorders compared to compounds without this group. This rule can be inferred from the fact that only one molecule labeled as 1 does not contain a nitro group, while all other molecules labeled as 1 contain at least one nitro group.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to gastrointestinal disorders:
Rule 1: If the molecule contains iron atoms and oxygen molecules, then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to the first two SMILES strings labeled as 1.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains zinc atoms or iodine atoms, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to the third and fourth SMILES strings labeled as 1.
Rule 3: If the molecule contains functional groups such as carbonyl groups, carboxyl groups, or sulfonyl groups, then it may also have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to the fifth through eighth SMILES strings labeled as 1.
It's important to note that these rules are based solely on the information provided in the given dataset and should be used cautiously until further research is conducted.

================================

Rule 1: If there exists a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecular structure, then it may lead to adverse effects such as gastrointestinal disorders or liver damage. The presence of this functional group can increase the polarity and hydrophilicity of the molecule, which can affect its absorption and distribution within the body.
Rule 2: If the molecule contains a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br), then it may also lead to adverse effects such as gastrointestinal disorders or liver damage. Halogen atoms can increase the lipophilicity of the molecule, which can affect its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets.
Rule 3: If the molecule has a conjugated system of double bonds, then it may have a higher potential for toxicity due to increased reactivity and susceptibility to oxidation. This can lead to adverse effects such as skin irritation, respiratory problems, or cancer.

================================

Rule 1: If a compound contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) and has a molecular weight less than or equal to 500 Daltons, then it may have a potential side-effect on the gastrointestinal system.
Explanation: The sulfonamide group is known for its antibacterial property but it can also irritate the stomach lining if taken in high doses. Therefore, compounds containing this functional group should be avoided if they have a low molecular weight as they tend to be more soluble and absorbable through the digestive tract.
Rule 2: If a compound contains a nitro group (-NO2) and has a molecular weight greater than 500 Daltons, then it may have a potential side-effect on the cardiovascular system.
Explanation: Nitro groups are known for their explosive nature but they can also cause vasodilation and increase heart rate when exposed to high concentrations. Therefore, compounds containing this functional group should be avoided if they have a high molecular weight as they tend to accumulate in the body over time.
Rule 3: If a compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and has a molecular weight between 180 and 600 Daltons, then it may have a potential side-effect on the skin.
Explanation: Carboxylic acids are known for their ability to penetrate the skin barrier and cause irritation. Therefore, compounds containing this functional group should be avoided if they have a moderate molecular weight as they tend to be more volatile and easily absorbed by the skin.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group and sulfonyl group in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system.
Rule 2: A compound containing halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine attached to aromatic rings may have higher chances of causing adverse effects on the digestive system.
Rule 3: Compounds having nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring structures may also exhibit similar behavior towards the gastrointestinal tract.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of barium ion in the molecular formula indicates that the compound may have some adverse effects on the digestive system.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure contains a silver ion and a sulfonamide group, it suggests that the compound has antibacterial properties and could potentially cause adverse reactions in the body if taken in high doses or for prolonged periods.
Rule 3: A molecule containing both chlorine atoms and a nitrile group may be associated with skin irritation and other adverse health effects when exposed to sunlight.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like "-CN" or "-NO2" in the structure of a molecule, then it may lead to adverse effects on the human body. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings starting from line number 7 onwards. For example, in the first SMILES string, the presence of "-CN" and "-NO2" groups makes this molecule potentially harmful for causing gastric problems.
Rule 2: If a molecule has a long carbon chain with multiple rings attached to it, it may also have potential adverse effects due to its high lipophilicity. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings starting from line number 9 onwards. For instance, in the second SMILES string, the presence of a long alkyl chain with two fused benzene rings increases the chances of this molecule being toxic.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it may be associated with adverse reactions such as skin rashes, fevers, and other allergic responses. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings starting from line number 18 onwards. For example, in the fifth SMILES string, the presence of a sulfonamide group makes this molecule highly allergenic.

================================

Rule 1: If the molecular structure contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-) or a nitro group (-NO2), then it may have potential adverse effects on the human body.
Explanation: Sulfonamides and nitro compounds are known to be toxic and can cause various health problems such as skin irritation, respiratory distress, and even cancer. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety before being used in medical applications.
Rule 2: If the molecular structure has a high number of rotatable bonds, then it may have a higher chance of causing adverse effects due to its flexibility.
Explanation: Rotatable bonds allow the molecule to change its shape easily, which can affect its interaction with other molecules and biological systems. Molecules with many rotatable bonds tend to be more flexible and may have a greater likelihood of interacting with proteins and enzymes in unexpected ways.
Rule 3: If the molecular structure contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), then it may have potential adverse effects on the central nervous system (CNS).
Explanation: Carboxylic acids are known to be irritants to the eyes and skin, and some studies suggest they can cross the blood-brain barrier and interfere with brain function. Therefore, molecules containing this functional group should be cautiously considered when designing drugs intended for CNS targets.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the human body.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to cause various types of toxicity, including gastrointestinal disturbances, skin irritation, and allergic reactions. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their safety profiles before being used in clinical settings or marketed as drugs.
Rule 2: Compounds with a high degree of lipophilicity tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues like the liver and brain, which can lead to toxic effects.
Explanation: Highly lipophilic molecules can easily cross cell membranes and enter into cells, where they can interfere with normal cellular processes and cause damage. This property should be taken into consideration when designing new drug candidates to minimize their potential toxicity.
Rule 3: The presence of certain structural features in a compound, such as aromatic rings, conjugated double bonds, and heterocyclic systems, can enhance its ability to interact with biological targets and modulate their functions. However, excessive exposure to these structures can also increase the risk of adverse effects due to non-specific interactions with other biomolecules.
Explanation: Aromatic rings, for example, are commonly found in many pharmaceuticals and can confer desirable properties such as increased stability and membrane permeability. However, they can also interact with proteins and enzymes in unintended ways, leading to off-target effects and toxicity. Therefore, the optimal balance between efficacy and safety must be achieved through careful design and evaluation of novel chemical entities.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like "-COOH" or "-OH" in the structure of a molecule, then it may lead to adverse effects on the human body due to its acidic nature and ability to form hydrogen bonds which can affect protein folding and other biological processes. Therefore, molecules containing these groups should be avoided if possible.
Example: Molecule no. 6 has a "-COOH" group present in its structure and hence it may have potential adverse effects.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains aromatic rings such as benzene or pyridine, they may also contribute to adverse effects by interacting with proteins and enzymes in the body. Hence, molecules containing these rings should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.
Example: Molecule no. 8 has a benzene ring present in its structure and therefore it needs careful evaluation before being used in any application.
Rule 3: Molecules having a high degree of symmetry or planarity may exhibit adverse effects due to their tendency to intercalate between DNA base pairs leading to mutations and cancer. Therefore, molecules possessing this property should be cautiously considered while designing new drugs.
Example: Molecule no. 9 has a highly symmetric structure and thus it requires cautionary use.

================================

Rule 1: If there is a presence of functional group like "-CN" or "-NO2" in the structure of a molecule, then it may lead to adverse effects on the human body. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings starting from line number 7 onwards. For example, in the first SMILES string, the presence of "-CN" and "-NO2" groups makes this molecule potentially harmful for causing gastric problems.
Rule 2: If a molecule has a long carbon chain with multiple rings attached to it, it may also have potential adverse effects due to its high lipophilicity. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings starting from line number 9 onwards. For instance, in the second SMILES string, the presence of a long alkyl chain with two fused benzene rings increases the chances of this molecule being toxic.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it may be associated with adverse reactions such as skin rashes, fevers, and other allergic responses. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings starting from line number 18 onwards. For example, in the fifth SMILES string, the presence of a sulfonamide group makes this molecule highly allergenic.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl group (C=O) and sulfonyl group (SO2R) in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system.
Explanation: These functional groups can interact with biological molecules and disrupt their normal functions, leading to negative consequences. For example, the C=O group can form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues in proteins, altering their structure and function. Similarly, the SO2R group can react with enzymes or other proteins, inhibiting their activities.
Rule 2: A compound containing aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also have a higher risk of causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system.
Explanation: Aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds can enhance the compound's ability to interact with biological molecules through π-π stacking interactions or electrostatic forces. This increased interaction can lead to more significant disruptions in cellular processes and potentially harmful outcomes.
Rule 3: Compounds with a high degree of lipophilicity tend to be more likely to cause adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system.
Explanation: Lipophilic compounds are more likely to penetrate cell membranes and interact with intracellular targets, which can lead to negative impacts on cellular processes. Additionally, lipophilic compounds may accumulate in tissues and organs, increasing their exposure to the body over time.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to irritate the stomach lining and lead to nausea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully evaluated for their potential to cause adverse effects on the digestive system.
Rule 2: Compounds with a high degree of lipophilicity tend to accumulate in adipose tissue and may cause adverse effects due to prolonged exposure over time.
Explanation: Highly lipophilic compounds may remain in the body for longer periods of time, leading to chronic toxicity or other long-term health problems. Therefore, compounds with high lipid solubility should be closely monitored for any potential adverse effects.
Rule 3: Compounds with a molecular weight greater than 500 Daltons may have difficulty crossing cell membranes and may require specialized transport mechanisms to enter cells. This could potentially limit their bioavailability and reduce their ability to cause adverse effects.
Explanation: Large molecules may have limited access to target sites within cells, reducing their effectiveness at causing toxic effects. Therefore, compounds with a molecular weight above 500 Daltons should be evaluated cautiously for their potential to cause adverse effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and amide in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system.
Explanation: These functional groups have the ability to form hydrogen bonds with proteins and other molecules within the body, which can disrupt their normal function and lead to negative consequences. For example, the sulfonyl group found in some drugs used to treat diabetes can bind to insulin receptors and prevent them from functioning properly, leading to hyperglycemia and other complications.
Rule 2: A compound containing multiple aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds may also be more likely to cause adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system due to its hydrophobic nature and tendency to accumulate in tissues.
Explanation: Aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds are often associated with high lipophilicity, which allows compounds containing these structures to easily cross cell membranes and interact with biological targets. This can lead to toxic effects and potentially harmful interactions with other molecules within the body.
Rule 3: Compounds containing certain atoms or atomic combinations, such as iron or nitrogen, may also be more prone to causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system.
Explanation: Iron is a metal ion that plays important roles in many biological processes, but excessive exposure to iron can lead to oxidative stress and tissue damage. Nitrogen-containing compounds, such as amines and amides, can react with other substances in the body to form toxic metabolites that can cause inflammation and other negative effects.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system.
Explanation: These functional groups have been known to irritate the stomach lining and lead to nausea or vomiting. Therefore, compounds containing these groups should be carefully monitored for their potential to cause gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 2: Compounds with a high degree of conjugation between π bonds may also increase the risk of causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system. This is because conjugated systems tend to be more reactive and can interact with biological molecules in unexpected ways.
Explanation: Conjugated systems can form stable radicals which can damage cells and tissues. They can also act as electron acceptors or donors, interfering with normal biochemical processes. Therefore, compounds with highly conjugated structures should be evaluated cautiously for their potential to cause gastrointestinal problems.
Rule 3: The number and position of halogen atoms in a compound can affect its ability to cross cell membranes and reach target sites within the body. Therefore, compounds with multiple halogens should be evaluated for their potential to cause adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system.
Explanation: Halogen atoms can increase the polarity and water solubility of a compound, making it easier for it to cross cell membranes. However, they can also increase the reactivity of the compound and potentially cause harm to biological molecules. Therefore, the location and number of halogen atoms in a compound should be taken into consideration when evaluating its potential to cause gastrointestinal disorders.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as sulfonamide and nitro groups in a compound may increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system. This rule can be applied to compounds labeled 1 in the given dataset. For example, the first compound contains a sulfonamide group which has been known to cause gastrointestinal irritation.
Rule 2: The presence of halogen atoms such as chlorine or fluorine in a compound may also increase its potential for causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system. This rule can be applied to compounds labeled 1 in the given dataset. For example, the fourth compound contains two chlorine atoms which may contribute to its ability to irritate the gastrointestinal tract.
Rule 3: The absence of certain structural features such as aromatic rings or double bonds may decrease the likelihood of a compound causing adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system. This rule can be applied to compounds labeled 0 in the given dataset. For example, the last compound does not contain any aromatic rings or double bonds, making it less likely to cause gastrointestinal irritation compared to other compounds in the dataset.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of certain functional groups in a molecule may increase its likelihood of causing adverse effects. For example, the presence of a sulfonamide group in a drug molecule has been linked to gastrointestinal disorders as a side effect. Therefore, if a molecule contains such a group, it should be labeled as having potential for causing this type of adverse effect.
Rule 2: The size and shape of a molecule may also play a role in determining its ability to cause adverse effects. For instance, molecules with a large surface area or a non-planar structure may have greater access to biological targets and therefore be more likely to interact with them and cause harm. Therefore, molecules with these characteristics should be labeled as potentially harmful.
Rule 3: The stereochemistry of a molecule may also affect its ability to cause adverse effects. For example, some drugs may have one enantiomer that is active while the other is inactive or less active. Therefore, if a molecule contains only one enantiomer, it should be labeled as potentially harmful until its activity is confirmed experimentally.

================================

Rule 1: The presence of negatively charged atoms such as oxygen and nitrogen in a compound increases its likelihood of causing GI disorders. This rule can be inferred from the fact that many drugs that cause GI disorders contain these electronegative elements. For example, the compound C1CC(CCC1OP(=O)([O-])OC[C@@H](CN(CCN(CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])N(CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-])(C2=CC=CC=C2)C3=CC=CC=C3 contains two negatively charged oxygen atoms which may contribute to its ability to cause GI disorders.
Rule 2: Compounds containing functional groups like sulfonates or phosphates have a higher chance of causing GI disorders than those without them. This rule can be derived from the observation that some drugs that cause GI disorders contain these functional groups. For instance, the compound CNS(=O)(=O)CC1=CC2=C(C=C1)NC=C2CCN(C)C contains a sulfonate group which may contribute to its potential to cause GI disorders.
Rule 3: Molecules with a high degree of symmetry tend to have lower chances of causing GI disorders compared to asymmetric molecules. This rule can be deduced by analyzing the structures of compounds that do not cause GI disorders. For example, the compound CC(C)

================================

Rule 1: The presence of negatively charged atoms such as oxygen and nitrogen in a compound increases its likelihood of causing GI disorders. This rule can be inferred from the fact that many drugs that cause GI disorders contain these electronegative elements.

Rule 3: Molecules with a high degree of symmetry tend to have lower chances of causing GI disorders compared to asymmetric molecules. This rule can be deduced by analyzing the structures of compounds that do not cause GI disorders. For example, the compound CC(C)

================================

Rule 1: The presence of functional groups such as carboxylic acid or its derivatives, amides and amines in a compound may increase the likelihood of causing gastrointestinal disorders. This rule can be applied to molecules represented by SMILES strings labeled as 1 for their potential association with these types of adverse effects. For example, the first molecule contains a carboxylic acid group which could contribute to this type of toxicity.
Rule 2: The presence of certain atoms or fragments in a molecule may also indicate its potential to cause adverse effects. For instance, the second molecule contains sodium ions which may affect its solubility and bioavailability. Therefore, compounds containing sodium ions should be carefully evaluated for their safety profile.
Rule 3: The molecular weight and lipophilicity of a compound may play a role in determining its ability to cross biological membranes and interact with target receptors. Compounds with high molecular weights and low lipophilicities may have limited access to target sites within the body and therefore exhibit lower levels of toxicity. However, exceptions to this general trend do exist and further analysis would be required to establish more specific structure-activity relationships.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains the substructure "COCCCCC(=NoCCn)c1ccc(cc1)C(f)(f)f" or "CCCCCCC(=OnOc1ccccc1C)o1ccc(cc1)C", then it is likely to have side-effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains the substructure "CON=C1cn(Cc2nnnc2Cn2Nc3ccccc3C(=O)NN2C)c2ccccc12", then it is also likely to have side-effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
Rule 3: If a molecule does not contain any of these substructures, but contains the substructure "CCOC(=O)CC(C(=O)OCC)sp(=S)(oc)oc", then it may not have side-effects related to gastrointestinal disorders.
Note that these rules are based solely on the provided dataset and may not generalize well to other molecules. It's important to use caution when making predictions about the safety of new molecules.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to gastrointestinal disorders:

Rule 3: If a molecule contains a sulfonamide group, it may be associated with adverse reactions such as skin rashes, fevers, and other allergic responses. This rule applies to molecules with SMILES strings starting from line number 18 onwards. For example, in the fifth SMILES string, the presence of a sulfonamide group makes this molecule highly allergenic.

================================

Based on the given dataset, here are three rules that could be used to predict if a molecule has the potential to cause adverse effects in relation to gastrointestinal disorders:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and a carbonyl group (-C=O), then it may have the potential to cause adverse effects related to gastrointestinal disorders. This rule applies to molecules 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65
