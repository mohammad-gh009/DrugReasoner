Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with high polarity tend to have higher values, while nonpolar molecules have lower values. For example, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has a high polar nature due to the presence of chlorine atoms, which results in its high ESOL value of -5.604. On the other hand, Cc1ccccn1 has a low polarity due to the absence of any polar functional groups, resulting in its relatively low ESOL value of -2.051.
Rule 2: The number and type of rings present in a molecule also affect its ESOL value. Molecules with multiple aromatic or heterocyclic rings tend to have higher values than those with single rings or no rings at all. For instance, CC34CCC1C(CCc2cc(O)ccc12)C3CC(O)C4O has two aromatic rings, which contributes to its high ESOL value of -3.858. In contrast, O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 has only one ring but it contains oxygen, which makes it more polar than hydrocarbons like Cc1ccccn1, leading to a slightly higher ESOL value of -4.254.
Rule 3: The presence of certain functional groups can significantly impact the ESOL value of a molecule. For example, Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34 has a nitro group attached to the benzene ring, which increases its polarity and leads to a moderate ESOL value of -4.849. Similarly, Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has an acyl chloride group, which is highly polar and results in a high ESOL value of -2.318.

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with high polarity tend to have higher values, while nonpolar molecules have lower values. For example, Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl has a much higher value than Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1 due to its polar nature.
Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyls or halogens can also affect the ESOL value. Functional groups with electronegative atoms tend to increase the overall polarity of the molecule, resulting in a higher ESOL value. For instance, CN(C)C(=S)SSC(=S)N(C)C contains two thiocarbonyl groups, which contribute to its relatively high value.
Rule 3: The molecular size and shape may also play a role in predicting the ESOL value. Generally, larger molecules tend to have lower values because they are less soluble in water. However, this rule is not always true since some large molecules with complex structures may still be highly soluble in water.

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower ESOL values, as they dissolve less easily in water due to stronger intermolecular forces between them. For example, BrCCBr has a low ESOL value of -2.102 because it contains two polar bromine atoms. On the other hand, Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a high ESOL value of -3.648 because it only contains one polar chlorine atom.
Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyls or nitro groups can also affect the ESOL value of a molecule. These groups increase the polarity of the molecule and make it more soluble in water. For instance, Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O has a relatively high ESOL value of -2.318 due to the presence of a nitro group. In contrast, CC(C)P(=S)(OC(C)C)SSC has a low ESOL value of -4.990 despite containing a thiophosphate group because its polarity is reduced by the presence of the nonpolar carbon chain.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of the carbon chain can also influence the ESOL value of a molecule. Longer chains tend to reduce the overall polarity of the molecule and make it less soluble in water. For example, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a much lower ESOL value than Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 because the former contains four chlorines while the latter only contains three.

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower ESOL values, as they dissolve less easily in water due to stronger intermolecular forces between them. For example, ClC(Cl)Cl has the lowest ESOL value among all the given molecules because it contains two highly polar chlorine atoms attached to the carbon atom. On the other hand, CO has the highest ESOL value since it is nonpolar and dissolves readily in water.
Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups can increase the hydrophilicity of a molecule and decrease its ESOL value. These groups form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, making the molecule more soluble in water. For instance, O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12 has a relatively low ESOL value of -1.882 due to the presence of the carbonyl group.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of the carbon chain also affect the ESOL value of a molecule. Longer chains or branched structures make it harder for the molecule to fit into the water molecules' structure, resulting in decreased solubility. For example, Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a slightly lower ESOL value than Cc1ccccc1 despite having bromine atoms instead of hydrogen atoms on the carbon chain. This is likely due to the increased bulkiness of the bromine atoms.

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower ESOL values, as they dissolve less easily in water due to stronger intermolecular forces between them. For example, the molecule Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a high polarity due to the presence of two chlorine atoms, which results in a low ESOL value of -7.343. On the other hand, the nonpolar molecule C has a relatively high ESOL value of -0.636 because it dissolves more readily in water.
Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl groups (C=O) or nitro groups (NO2) can increase the polarity of a molecule and decrease its ESOL value. For instance, the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC=C has two carbonyl groups, resulting in a low ESOL value of -1.368. In contrast, the molecule CC(C)C(C)C lacks any polar functional groups, leading to a moderate ESOL value of -2.584.
Rule 3: The molecular size and shape also play a role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Generally, larger and more complex molecules tend to have lower ESOL values than smaller and simpler ones. This is because larger molecules have more surface area available for interaction with water molecules, which can lead to stronger intermolecular forces and reduced solubility. For example, the molecule CCC1CCCCC1 has a large and complex structure, resulting in a low ESOL value of -3.245. Conversely, the small and simple molecule CO has a moderately high ESOL value of 0.441.

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower ESOL values, as they dissolve less easily in water due to stronger intermolecular forces between them. For example, the molecule CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OC(C#N)c2ccc(F)c(Oc3ccccc3)c2 has a high polarity due to the presence of multiple functional groups such as carbonyl, chloride, and nitrile groups. Therefore, it has a low ESOL value of -6.840. On the other hand, the nonpolar molecule Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O has a relatively high ESOL value of -2.553 because it dissolves more readily in water.
Rule 2: The number and type of functional groups present in a molecule also affect its ESOL value. Molecules with multiple polar functional groups tend to have lower ESOL values than those with fewer or nonpolar functional groups. For instance, the molecule COC(C)(C)CCCC(C)CC=CC(C)=CC(=O)OC(C)C has four polar functional groups, which contribute to its low ESOL value of -4.795. In contrast, the nonpolar molecule c1ccc2ccccc2 has no functional groups and therefore has a high ESOL value of -3.468.
Rule 3: The molecular size and shape can also influence the ESOL value of a molecule. Generally, larger molecules with complex shapes tend to have lower ESOL values compared to smaller ones with simpler structures. This is because large molecules have more surface area available for interaction with water molecules, leading to stronger intermolecular forces and reduced solubility. For example, the molecule CCC1(C(C)C)C(=

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower ESOL values, as they dissolve less easily in water due to stronger intermolecular forces between them. For example, ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccccc2Cl has the lowest ESOL value among all the given molecules because it contains two highly polar chlorine atoms attached to the carbon chain. On the other hand, Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 has one chlorine atom but also has a carbonyl group which makes it more polar than c1(C(C)(C)C)cc(C(C)(C)C)cc(OC(=O)NC)c1, resulting in a slightly lower ESOL value.
Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl, sulfonyl, and nitro groups can increase the polarity of a molecule and decrease its ESOL value. For instance, CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C has a carbonyl group and a highly polarized double bond, leading to a low ESOL value. Similarly, Cc1cc(C)c(C)cc1C has a relatively high ESOL value despite having a carbonyl group because there are no other strongly polar functional groups present.
Rule 3: The length and flexibility of the carbon chain also play a role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Longer chains tend to have lower ESOL values since they require more energy to break the intermolecular forces holding them together. Additionally, flexible chains may be able to adopt different conformations in solution, further reducing their ability to dissolve in water. For example, CCC(C)C(C)C has a longer carbon chain compared to COc1ccccc1, resulting in a lower ESOL value.

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower ESOL values, as they dissolve less easily in water due to stronger intermolecular forces between them. For example, BrCCBr has a low ESOL value of -2.102 because it contains two polar bromine atoms. On the other hand, Cc1ccc(N)cc1 has a high ESOL value of -1.954 despite containing a polar nitrogen atom because its nonpolar carbon chain makes it more soluble in water.
Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyls or sulfurs can increase the polarity of a molecule and decrease its ESOL value. For instance, CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C has a relatively low ESOL value of -3.165 due to the presence of a carbonyl group. Similarly, O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 also has a low ESOL value of -3.057 due to the presence of a carbonyl group.
Rule 3: The length and flexibility of a molecule's carbon chain can affect its ESOL value. Longer chains tend to make a molecule more hydrophobic and increase its solubility in water, resulting in a higher ESOL value. For example, CCC(=O)C has a moderate ESOL value of -0.491 while c1(C#N)c(Cl)c(C#N)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)1 has a much higher ESOL value of -3.995 due to its longer carbon chain. Additionally, flexible chains may allow for greater movement and reduce intermolecular forces, leading to increased solubility in water and a higher ESOL value.

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower ESOL values, as they dissolve less easily in water due to stronger intermolecular forces between them. For example, CCOC has a low ESOL value of -0.857 because it contains two polar carbonyl groups. On the other hand, c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2 has a high ESOL value of -4.685 because it is nonpolar.
Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids can increase the hydrophilicity of a molecule, leading to a decrease in its ESOL value. For instance, CC(OH)CH has a relatively low ESOL value of -2.486 compared to CCC(C)OOCC, which has a much higher ESOL value of -3.876 despite having similar molecular weight and structure. This is likely due to the presence of the hydroxyl group in CC(OH)CH, which increases its polarity and makes it more soluble in water.
Rule 3: The size and shape of a molecule also play a role in determining its ESOL value. Generally, larger and more complex molecules tend to have lower ESOL values than smaller and simpler ones. For example, ClC(=C)Cl has a significantly lower ESOL value of -1.939 than CSC, which only has one carbon atom and a sulfur atom. Additionally, linear molecules tend to have slightly higher ESOL values than branched or cyclic ones, as they have fewer degrees of freedom and are less flexible.

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with high polarity tend to have higher values, while nonpolar molecules have lower values. For example, NC(=S)N has a relatively low value due to its nonpolar nature, whereas Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 has a much higher value because it contains polar chlorine atoms.
Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyls or alcohols can increase the hydrophilicity of a molecule, leading to a higher ESOL value. For instance, COc1c(O)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a significantly higher value than Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 due to the presence of a carbonyl group.
Rule 3: The size and shape of a molecule also play a role in determining its ESOL value. Generally, larger and more complex molecules tend to have lower values since they are less soluble in water. For example, Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1 has a slightly lower value compared to CC#C due to its larger size.

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower ESOL values, as they dissolve better in polar solvents like water. For example, ClCc1ccccc1 has a low ESOL value of -2.887 due to its high polarity caused by the presence of chlorine atom. On the other hand, Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O has a relatively high ESOL value of -2.553 because it lacks any highly polar functional groups.
Rule 2: The number and type of functional groups present in a molecule also affect its ESOL value. Functional groups such as carbonyls, alcohols, and amines increase the polarity of a molecule and hence decrease its ESOL value. For instance, CC(C)CCO has a low ESOL value of -1.308 due to the presence of two carbonyl groups. In contrast, Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a much higher ESOL value of -3.705 despite having one chlorine atom due to the absence of any strongly polar functional group.
Rule 3: The size and shape of a molecule can also influence its ESOL value. Generally, larger molecules with complex shapes tend to have lower ESOL values than smaller ones with simpler structures. This is because large molecules require more space to accommodate themselves within the solvent, which can be difficult for highly polar solvents like water. For example, Brc1cccc2ccccc12 has a low ESOL value of -4.434 due to its bulky structure and multiple functional groups.

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower ESOL values, as they dissolve less easily in water due to stronger intermolecular forces between them. For example, Clc1ccccc1 has a low ESOL value of -1.761 because it contains highly polar chlorine atoms. On the other hand, Cc1cccc(C)c1 has a high ESOL value of -3.312 despite containing a polar carbonyl group, likely due to its nonpolar alkyl chain.
Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as halogen substituents or nitro groups can significantly affect the ESOL value of a molecule. Halogen substituents increase molecular polarity and decrease aqueous solubility, while nitro groups increase molecular polarity but also increase hydrogen bonding ability, leading to complex effects on ESOL values. For instance, Clc1ccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has a relatively low ESOL value of -5.915 compared to Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a similar structure except for one additional chlorine atom at the end of each side chain. Similarly, Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2 has a moderate ESOL value of -1.404 despite having two polar nitro groups, likely due to their orientation preventing strong interactions with water.
Rule 3: Molecular size and shape can also impact ESOL values. Generally, larger molecules with more complex shapes tend to have lower ESOL values than smaller, simpler ones. This is because larger molecules have more surface area available for interaction with water, increasing the strength of intermolecular forces and decreasing solubility. For example, CCCCS(=O)CC(CO)NC(=O)C=Cc1c(C)[nH]c(=O)[nH]c1=O has a moderately low ESOL value

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower ESOL values, as they dissolve better in polar solvents like water. For example, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has the lowest ESOL value among all the given molecules because it contains both iodine and chlorine atoms which increase its polarity. On the other hand, Cc1c(C)c2c3ccccc3ccc2c4ccccc14 has the highest ESOL value due to its nonpolar nature.
Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl, nitro, and halogen groups can also affect the ESOL value of a molecule. These groups increase the polarity of the molecule and make it easier for it to dissolve in water. For instance, COOP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(cc1Cl)N(=O)=O has a high ESOL value due to the presence of the nitro group.
Rule 3: The molecular size and shape of a molecule can also influence its ESOL value. Generally, larger molecules with complex structures tend to have lower ESOL values than smaller ones with simpler structures. This is because large molecules require more energy to break intermolecular forces between them and the solvent molecules before they can dissolve. For example, CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C has a relatively low ESOL value compared to CCC(C)O or N#Cc1ccccc1.

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with high polarity tend to have higher values, while nonpolar molecules have lower values. For example, ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a high polar functional group like C=O which contributes to its high ESOL value of -3.988. On the other hand, COc1cccc(Cl)c1 has a low polarity due to the absence of any polar groups, resulting in a relatively low ESOL value of -3.057.
Rule 2: The presence of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can also affect the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with multiple hydrogen bond donor or acceptor sites tend to have higher values than those without such sites. For instance, CCC(C)(C)Cl has two hydrogen bond donor sites (-CH3), leading to a moderate ESOL value of -2.278. In contrast, O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12 lacks both hydrogen bond donor and acceptor sites, resulting in a significantly lower ESOL value of -3.414.
Rule 3: Molecular size and shape may also play a role in predicting the ESOL value of a molecule. Generally, larger molecules tend to have lower values because they have more surface area available for solvation. Additionally, molecules with complex shapes may have lower values as well since it takes longer for them to dissolve completely compared to spherical or linear molecules. For example, Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a large molecular volume and a complex structure, resulting in a moderately low ESOL value of -3.705.

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower ESOL values, as they dissolve less easily in water due to stronger intermolecular forces between them. For example, molecules like CN(=O)=O and Cc1c(C)c2c3ccccc3ccc2c4ccccc14 have high polarities due to the presence of multiple functional groups such as nitro and carbonyl groups, resulting in low ESOL values of -0.042 and -6.265 respectively. On the other hand, nonpolar molecules like CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OC(C#N)c2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2 have relatively low polarities, leading to a higher ESOL value of -6.775.
Rule 2: The number and type of functional groups present in a molecule also affect its ESOL value. Molecules with more hydrophilic functional groups like hydroxyl or carboxyl groups tend to have higher ESOL values than those with hydrophobic groups like alkyl chains. For instance, Oc1ccccc1 has no functional group, resulting in a low ESOL value of -2.318. In contrast, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has one bromine atom which is highly hydrophilic, causing it to have a much higher ESOL value of -4.434.
Rule 3: The molecular size and shape of a molecule can also influence its ESOL value. Generally, larger molecules with complex structures tend to have lower ESOL values compared to smaller ones with simpler structures. This is because larger molecules have more surface area available for interaction with water molecules, increasing the strength of intermolecular forces and making dissolution more difficult. For example, CCC(CC)CO has a simple structure with only three carbon atoms, resulting in a moderate ESOL value of -1.381. However, C

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower ESOL values, as they dissolve less easily in water due to stronger intermolecular forces between them. For example, the first molecule has a chlorine atom attached to each carbon atom, making it highly polar and resulting in a low ESOL value of -7.343. On the other hand, the last molecule does not have any polar groups, leading to a high ESOL value of -8.304.
Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyls or nitro groups can also affect the ESOL value of a molecule. These groups increase the polarity of the molecule and make it more soluble in water, resulting in a lower ESOL value. For instance, the second molecule has two carbonyl groups, which contribute to its relatively low ESOL value of -5.762. In contrast, the fourth molecule lacks any polar groups, resulting in a much higher ESOL value of -1.761.
Rule 3: The size and shape of a molecule can also influence its ESOL value. Generally, larger molecules with complex shapes tend to be less soluble in water than smaller ones with simpler structures. This is because the former have more surface area available for interaction with water molecules, increasing the strength of intermolecular forces and reducing their ability to dissolve. For example, the thirteenth molecule is large and complex, resulting in a moderate ESOL value of -3.648.

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower ESOL values, as they dissolve less easily in water due to stronger intermolecular forces between them. For example, the molecule Cc1ccccc1 has a low ESOL value of -2.281 because it contains polar functional groups such as carbonyl and ether groups. On the other hand, nonpolar molecules like CC(C)(C)CO have a high ESOL value of -1.011 since they do not interact strongly with water.
Rule 2: The presence of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can also affect the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with multiple hydrogen bond donor or acceptor sites tend to have lower ESOL values than those without. For instance, Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl has two chlorine atoms acting as hydrogen bond acceptors, resulting in a relatively low ESOL value of -5.762. In contrast, Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has no hydrogen bond donors or acceptors, leading to a much higher ESOL value of -2.318.
Rule 3: Molecular size and shape can also play a role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Generally, larger molecules with more complex shapes tend to have lower ESOL values compared to smaller ones with simpler structures. This is because larger molecules have more surface area available for interaction with water, which can lead to stronger intermolecular forces and reduced solubility. For example, CCC(C)C(=O)C has a low ESOL value of -1.266 despite having only four carbon atoms, while c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 has a significantly higher ESOL value of -0.717 even though it has just five heavy atoms.

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower ESOL values, as they are more soluble in polar solvents like water. For example, molecules such as CCON(=O)C, OCCCC=C, OC1CCCCCC1, CCCC(C)(C)C, Oc1ccccn1, CCNN(=O)C, ClC=C, NC(=O)NNC(=O)NOC, Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl, COc1ccccc1, c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32, FCCCF, FClC(F)(Cl)Cl, COP(=O)(OC)OS(=O)(=O)C(Cl)(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Brmay have relatively low ESOL values due to their high polarity.
Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyls or nitro groups can also affect the ESOL value of a molecule. These groups increase the polarity of the molecule and may lead to lower ESOL values. For instance, molecules containing carbonyl groups such as CC(C)=CCCC(C)=CC(=O), CCOC=O, CCS(=O)(=O)C, CN(C)CSSCC(=O)O, CNC(=O)NS(=O)(=O)C, NCCSNC(=O)O, NHC(=O)NH, CH3CH2OH, CF3COOHmay have slightly lower ESOL values compared to those without these groups.
Rule 3: The molecular size and shape of a compound can also influence its ESOL value. Generally, larger and more complex molecules tend to have lower ESOL values than smaller ones because they require more energy to break intermolecular

================================

Rule 1: The presence of polar functional groups such as carbonyl, hydroxyl, and amine groups increases the aqueous solubility of a compound due to hydrogen bonding between these groups and water molecules. Therefore, compounds containing these groups tend to have higher ESOL values than those without them. For example, CCC(C)(C)C has a high ESOL value of -2.938 because it contains two carbonyl groups. On the other hand, COCOC has a low ESOL value of 0.092 since it does not contain any polar functional groups.
Rule 2: The number and position of alkyl substituents on a compound can also affect its ESOL value. Generally, increasing the number of alkyl substituents decreases the polarity of the compound and thus reduces its ability to dissolve in water. This is why C has a relatively high ESOL value of -0.636 compared to CC(C)(C)C which has one less alkyl substituent but a lower ESOL value of -2.938. Additionally, the position of alkyl substituents can also impact solubility. For instance, Brc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a much higher ESOL value of -6.155 than Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl despite having similar structures except for the position of the bromine atom.
Rule 3: The presence of aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds can increase the hydrophobicity of a compound and therefore decrease its aqueous solubility. For example, c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3c4ccccc4ccc23 has a low ESOL value of -5.568 due to the presence of three aromatic rings. In contrast, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccccc1 has a high ESOL value of -1.847 due to the absence of aromatic rings and the presence of a polar amide group.

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower ESOL values, as they dissolve less easily in water due to stronger intermolecular forces between them. For example, Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl has a high negative ESOL value of -8.304 because it contains four chlorine atoms, which increase its polarity and make it difficult for the molecule to dissolve in water. On the other hand, C#C has a low positive ESOL value of -0.252 since it is nonpolar and does not interact strongly with water.
Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyls or nitro groups can also affect the ESOL value of a molecule. These groups can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, making it easier for the molecule to dissolve in water. For instance, COc1c(O)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has two carbonyl groups and a relatively high ESOL value of -4.299 compared to most other compounds in the dataset. Similarly, Brc1cccc(Br)c1 has one bromine atom and a moderate ESOL value of -4.298.
Rule 3: The length and complexity of a molecule's carbon chain can also impact its ESOL value. Longer chains may lead to increased hydrophobicity and decreased aqueous solubility. For example, CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O has a complex structure with multiple rings and has a moderately low ESOL value of -3.659. In contrast, CCC(C)CC has only three carbons but a much higher ESOL value of -2.600.

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower ESOL values, as they dissolve less easily in water due to stronger intermolecular forces between them. For example, molecules such as Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, Cc1cccc(C)n1, CC(C)C(O)C(C)C, COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1, O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O, FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br, CN(C)C(=O)Oc1nc(nc(C)c1C)N(C)C, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl, FCCCF, CCI, ICI, CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1OC(C)C, CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC, c1(O)c(C)ccc(C(C)C)c1, Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl, c1(C#N)c(Cl)c(C#N)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)1, COC(C)(C)C, ON=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O, NC(=O)c1cccnc1, Cc1ccc(C)cc1, CCSSC, NCCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NC(C)C)n1, CCl3, F3C(F)(Cl)C(F)(Cl)Cl, c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2, Cc1ccc(C)cc1, OC(C)C, CCNC(=O)

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower ESOL values, as they dissolve less easily in water due to stronger intermolecular forces between them. For example, COc1ccc(C=CC)cc1 has a relatively low ESOL value of -3.254 because it contains a polar carbonyl group (C=O) which can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. On the other hand, Cc1cc(C)c(C)cc1C has a high ESOL value of -3.664 despite having a similar structure, because its nonpolar alkyl groups do not interact strongly with water.
Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as halogen atoms or nitro groups can also affect the ESOL value of a molecule. Halogen atoms such as bromine or chlorine increase the polarity of a molecule and thus decrease its ESOL value. For instance, CCCCCBr has an ESOL value of -2.658 while ClCC(Cl)Cl has an even lower value of -1.961. Similarly, nitro groups (-NO2) can form strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules, making molecules containing them more soluble in water than those without. For example, Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F has a much higher ESOL value of -0.132 compared to CCCON(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 which has a slightly negative ESOL value of -2.671.
Rule 3: The molecular size and shape of a molecule can also influence its ESOL value. Generally, larger and more complex molecules tend to have lower ESOL values since they require more energy to break apart their intermolecular interactions and dissolve in water. For example, c1cc(C)cc2c1c3cc4cccc5CC

================================

To come up with three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict its ESOL value, we can follow these steps:
Step 1: Identify common features among the molecules whose ESOL values are given. In this case, we can see that all the molecules have carbon atoms but differ in their functional groups.
Step 2: Analyze how each functional group affects the ESOL value of the molecule. For example, carbonyl groups (C=O) tend to increase the polarity of the molecule, which makes it more soluble in polar solvents like water. Therefore, molecules containing carbonyl groups generally have higher ESOL values than those without them. Similarly, halogen atoms like chlorine or bromine also increase the polarity of the molecule and hence increase its ESOL value.
Step 3: Based on our analysis, we can come up with three rules that can be used to predict the ESOL value of a new molecule based on its structure:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains one or more carbonyl groups, its ESOL value will likely be higher than if it does not contain any carbonyl groups.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains one or more halogen atoms, its ESOL value will likely be higher than if it does not contain any halogen atoms.
Rule 3: The presence of other functional groups such as alkyl groups, alkenyl groups, alkynyl groups, etc. may also affect the ESOL value of a molecule depending on their nature and position. However, these effects cannot be generalized and need to be analyzed individually for each molecule.

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower ESOL values, as they dissolve better in polar solvents like water. For example, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has a high polarity due to the presence of two chlorine atoms on opposite ends of the molecule, resulting in a low ESOL value of -5.604. On the other hand, Oc1cccc2ccccc12 has a relatively low polarity due to its symmetrical structure, leading to a slightly higher ESOL value of -3.080.
Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyl groups or double bonds can also affect the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules containing these groups may have lower ESOL values than those without them. For instance, C/C=C/C=O has no functional group and has one of the highest ESOL values among the given molecules at -0.604. In contrast, COc1ccccc1 has a carbonyl group and has a significantly lower ESOL value of -1.999.
Rule 3: The molecular size and shape of a molecule can also influence its ESOL value. Generally, larger molecules with complex shapes tend to have lower ESOL values because it takes more energy to break the intermolecular forces between them and dissolve them in water. For example, c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 has a large and complex structure, resulting in a low ESOL value of -4.079. Conversely, CC(C)CO has a smaller and simpler structure, resulting in a higher ESOL value of -0.672.

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower ESOL values, as they dissolve less easily in water due to stronger intermolecular forces between them. For example, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a high negative ESOL value of -7.343 because it contains highly polar chlorine atoms. On the other hand, Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO has a low positive ESOL value of -0.859 because its carbonyl group is not very polar.
Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids can increase the hydrophilicity of a molecule, leading to a decrease in its ESOL value. For instance, O=c1cc[nH]c(=O)[nH]1 has a relatively low negative ESOL value of -0.441 because it contains a nonpolar alkene group. However, when it reacts with hydrochloric acid to form a chlorinated alcohol, its ESOL value decreases further due to increased polarity from the hydroxyl group.
Rule 3: The size and shape of a molecule also play a role in determining its ESOL value. Generally, larger and more complex molecules tend to have lower ESOL values than smaller ones. This is because they have more surface area available for interaction with water molecules, which can lead to stronger intermolecular forces and reduced solubility. For example, CC(C)Cl has a moderate negative ESOL value of -1.585 while c1ccc(Cl)cc1C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)(O)C(=O)OC(C)C has a much lower one of -5.093 despite having similar functional groups. This is likely due to its greater size and complexity.

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower ESOL values, as they dissolve better in polar solvents like water. For example, CN(C)c1ccccc1 has the lowest ESOL value among all the given molecules due to its high polarity caused by the presence of both nitrogen and oxygen atoms. On the other hand, c1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has the highest ESOL value because it contains only chlorine atoms which are nonpolar.
Rule 2: The number and type of functional groups present in a molecule also affect its ESOL value. Functional groups such as hydroxyl, carbonyl, and amino groups increase the polarity of a molecule and hence decrease its ESOL value. For instance, CCNOCC has a lower ESOL value than CCCONC since the former has two carbonyl groups while the latter has one carbonyl group and one amino group.
Rule 3: The molecular size and shape of a molecule can also influence its ESOL value. Generally, larger molecules with complex shapes tend to have lower ESOL values compared to smaller ones with simple structures. This is because large molecules require more energy to break intermolecular forces between solvent and solute molecules before dissolving. For example, Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a much lower ESOL value than Cc1ccccc1 despite having similar functional groups due to its larger size and more complex structure.

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with high polarity tend to have higher values, while nonpolar molecules have lower values. For example, COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC has a relatively low value of -2.347 due to its nonpolar nature. On the other hand, CC(OC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1)C#C has a much higher value of -3.629 because it contains polar functional groups such as carbonyl and nitro groups.
Rule 2: The presence of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can also affect the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with multiple hydrogen bond donors or acceptors tend to have higher values than those without. For instance, Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 has a moderate value of -2.392 since it contains one chlorine atom which acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor. In contrast, Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C has a significantly lower value of -1.733 despite containing two polar functional groups because it lacks any hydrogen bond donor or acceptor.
Rule 3: Molecular size and shape may also play a role in predicting the ESOL value of a molecule. Generally, larger molecules tend to have lower values compared to smaller ones. This is because large molecules have more surface area available for solvation, making them easier to dissolve in water. Additionally, linear molecules tend to have slightly higher values than branched or cyclic molecules due to their greater flexibility and ability to form stronger intermolecular interactions.

================================

To come up with three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict its ESOL value, we can follow these steps:
Step 1: Identify common features among the molecules whose ESOL values are given above.
Step 2: Assign a numerical value to each feature based on how much it contributes to the overall ESOL value. For example, if a certain functional group increases the ESOL value by X units, then all molecules containing this functional group should be assigned a value of X for that feature.
Step 3: Use the assigned values to create a set of rules that can be used to predict the ESOL value of any new molecule based on its structure. Here are three possible rules:
Rule 1: If a molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), assign it a value of +0.5. Otherwise, assign it a value of 0.
Rule 2: If a molecule contains a halogen atom (such as Cl or Br), assign it a value of +X, where X is the average increase in ESOL value observed for other molecules containing halogens. In this case, X would be around +1.5.
Rule 3: If a molecule contains a long chain of carbon atoms, assign it a value of -Y, where Y is the average decrease in ESOL value observed for other molecules containing long chains. In this case, Y would be around -0.5.
Using these rules, we can calculate the predicted ESOL value for each molecule in the table:
CCOC=C -0.857 (predicted ESOL value = 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25)
Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1 -4.621 (predicted ESOL value = 1.5 x 1.5 = 2.25)
CC(=O)

================================

Rule 1: Polarity plays a significant role in determining the ESOL value of a molecule. Molecules with higher polarity tend to have lower ESOL values, as they dissolve less easily in water due to stronger intermolecular forces between them. For example, the molecule ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl has a high degree of polarity due to its chlorine atoms, which results in a low ESOL value of -4.009. On the other hand, the nonpolar molecule CC has a relatively high ESOL value of -1.132 because it dissolves more readily in water.
Rule 2: The presence of functional groups such as carbonyls or nitro groups can also affect the ESOL value of a molecule. These groups increase the polarity of the molecule and make it less soluble in water, resulting in a lower ESOL value. For instance, the molecule CN2C(=O)CN=C(c1ccccc1)c3cc(ccc23)N(=O)=O contains both a carbonyl group and a nitro group, which contribute to its low ESOL value of -3.557. In contrast, the molecule COc1ccc(Cl)cc1 lacks these functional groups and has a higher ESOL value of -3.057.
Rule 3: The molecular size and shape of a molecule can also influence its ESOL value. Generally, larger and more complex molecules tend to have lower ESOL values than smaller and simpler ones. This is because larger molecules have more surface area available for interaction with water molecules, which can lead to stronger intermolecular forces and reduced solubility. For example, the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl has a relatively large size and complex structure, which contributes to its low ESOL value of -3.572.

================================

To come up with three rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule to predict its ESOL value, we can follow these steps:
Step 1: Identify common features among the molecules whose ESOL values are given. In this case, we can see that all the molecules have carbon atoms but differ in their functional groups and structures.
Step 2: Analyze how each feature affects the ESOL value by comparing it with other similar molecules. For example, if we compare the first two molecules, we can see that they both have carbonyl groups (-C=O) but one has a benzene ring while the other does not. We can assume that the presence of the benzene ring may increase the ESOL value because it makes the molecule more hydrophobic. Similarly, we can analyze the effect of other functional groups such as -OH, -NH2, etc. on the ESOL value.
Step 3: Based on our analysis, we can come up with three rules that can be used to predict the ESOL value of new molecules:
Rule 1: The presence of polar functional groups like -OH, -COOH, -NH2, etc. increases the ESOL value due to increased hydrophilicity.
Rule 2: The presence of nonpolar functional groups like -CH3, -C=C-, etc. decreases the ESOL value due to decreased hydrophilicity.
Rule 3: The size and shape of the molecule also affect its ESOL value. Molecules with larger sizes and complex shapes tend to have lower ESOL values than those with smaller sizes and simpler shapes.
Using these rules, we can predict the ESOL values of new molecules based on their structural features.
