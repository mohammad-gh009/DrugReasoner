Rule 1: If there exists at least one functional group such as -COOH or -CONHR in the molecule, then it may have inhibitory activity against HIV replication. This rule is based on the fact that these groups can form hydrogen bonds and interact with the target protein involved in viral entry into host cells. Rule 2: If the molecular weight of the compound is less than 500 Da, then it may not possess any significant antiviral property due to its inability to penetrate cell membranes effectively. Therefore, larger molecules tend to exhibit better biological activities compared to smaller ones. Rule 3: The presence of aromatic rings in the structure also plays a crucial role in determining the potency of the drug candidate because they can enhance hydrophobic interactions between the ligand and receptor proteins.
