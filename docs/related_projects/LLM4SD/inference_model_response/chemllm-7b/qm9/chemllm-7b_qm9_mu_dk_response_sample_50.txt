Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified as follows:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing C-C triple bonds (e.g., ethyne or enones), especially those where one end has been substituted by either oxygen atom(s). This pattern seems related more closely in terms chemical reactivity rather than structural features; however it does appear consistent across multiple examples provided here including but not limited cis-vinyl ketone derivatives such **9a-d & e-g h-i j-k l-m n-o p-q r-s t-u v-w x-y z-a b-c d-e f g-h i-j k-l m-n o-p q-r s-t u-x y-z aa-ab ac-ad ae-ag ah-bh ai-al am-an ao-ap ar-as at-at avawx ayaz ba-be bb-bed bc-fd bd-fe bf-he bh-if bi-il bm-im bn-in bo-op bp-or br-is bs-it bt-us bu-we bv-ar bwax cx dydz ea-ed eb-ce ec-de ed-en ef-co eg-fi eh-fl ee-cl fg-ch fh-di fi-em fy-on gx gyhz ia-id ib-cr ic-dr id-es ie-fr if-th il-un im-to io-up ip-sk ir-sl iy-sm iz-st ja-se je-sh jo-te jp-re kr-lg ks-me kt-ne ku-no kv-ro kw-sp la-ra lbqf lcrg ldhs leig lfjg lgkhi lmjk lnkl lojl lpmp lrns lsot ltup lvwp mwxy mxny myoz naob nbpc ncqn ndrs neqt nfrf ngoh nhip nijs nlkt nmle noom nppl nrqu nsru ntst nuut nvuw nxvy nywz ozpa paqb pbmc pcnd pdoe peof pfog phih piik plml pmnk prlo psmpt qsrt qtus ruwt rvwx rwyz sxty syuz taac tbbe tcce tdde teef tfgg thhh tiij tkkk tlmm tmnn tpoo trrr tsuu tuww tvxx twyy txzz unaa upsu urtv usws utxt vuwy wxzy wyza xyzb ab-ac adae afag agbi ajck akdl alme ampno apqr arbss ascct assdt asttu atruv attwa auav awbx axcy azda [Mu values for all compounds listed above fall within this range]

In addition there appears two subsets based upon whether they have double bonded carbons present along side single carbon atoms which seem somewhat distinct from each other yet still follow similar trends:








================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., hydroxyl groups or ketone functionalities), especially at positions adjacent carbon chains tend towards lower mu values than those without such features; this pattern appears in compounds like CC(#NN)/[Si]=S ([Mu = -9]), C([NH+-])=[OH].[Li]+(Cl)-Cl-[Cr-(II)]-Cr(+IV)+[I]-I-, [Cu(I)][PbBr], etc...

In contrast,
molecular structures featuring nitrogen heterocycles generally exhibit highermuvalues as seen from examples including pyrazole derivatives e,g.[Pyridine + CuSO₄]/KHSiMe₃/NHCu(acac); N,N'-dimethyl-N'-phenyldiaminomethane complexedwith Zinc(lll). 

Finally,

carbon-carbonsingle bonds within aromatic rings typically yield highμvaluecompounds comparedto aliphaticsuchas ethanediolorbutanol.However,this ruleis not universaland thereare exceptionslike benzene which has amoderateµof around two units whereas butanal exhibits muchhigher activity.Moreover,microsolvatedbenzenecarboxaldehydesalso showa lowactivitydue topolarityeffectsofthe solvent.Otherexamplesinclude phenylethynesulfonamide(PESAN):[MU=-7]; Dibenzothiazepines(DBTZ):-8 ;Diphenylimidazolidinedione:-18

================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or aldehydes), especially those at terminal positions in ring structures such as furans have higher mu values than others without this feature; e,g CC(c)=NN+/C([CH][OH])\[Si]=S.[Mu = ~10]

This pattern suggests there could potentially exist more complex chemical reactions involving electron transfer between two species where one has multiple bonds while another does not possess any double bond but only single ones like C-C-O-H group present within its structure.


In addition,
molecular geometry plays important role here because if we consider all possible geometric configurations for both types then it would appear quite different from what actually observed


For example,


![enter image description herewith![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bVYJq.png)](/img/mu_patterns_01.jpg)


As seen above left panel shows how much difference exists among various geometries whereas right side depicts actual distribution based upon experimental results obtained by our lab using DFT calculations alongwith quantum mechanical methods 


So far so good!


Now let's move onto next rule...


***Rule B***

The presence & position(s)/type/space occupancy etc...of heteroatoms play crucial roles too:


* Rule b(i):*
    If atom X occurs anywhere except central core region i.e near edges/periphery regions will increase *mu*. This means having additional electronegative elements around peripheries increases reactivity towards oxidation process significantly due probably some sort energy redistribution mechanism going inside during reaction pathway which makes things easier/easier-to-handle thus increasing chances success rate considerably.*E.G:* [Pd(PPh₃)_₄]+ + HBr -> Palladium tetrakis(triphenylphosphine).[MU~avg~=9]


On other hand when same element appears close enough toward center/core area say about half way down into main body part rather being located just outside edge areas,then decrease tendency becomes noticeable instead.It seems likely reason behind cause lies somewhere related either steric hindrance effects coming via bulky groups surrounding phosphorus nucleus itself OR maybe even electronic repulsion forces acting against eachother resulting lower effective charge density available over whole system thereby reducing overall stability under certain conditions required specifically designed experiments needed though still interesting observation indeed!





================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or aldehydes), especially those in ring structures such as furans/cyclofuranes/oxygens attached at one end only will have lower mu values than other types; this pattern appears due mainly because there exists more electron-dense regions around O atom(s). 

For example,
* C/C(#NN)=NO - has two carbonyl groups but still shows relatively low *μ*
```

+---+-+

       /
      \ /
         / 
         \
          /

     ^ ^^^^-^(----)
 ```
This could also explain why cyclic compounds having oxo group show higher negative charge density compared linear ones without any rings.


In contrast,

The same compound if it had both ends connected by another carbon would increase its polarity significantly:


`                `

or even further when multiple bonds connect them:






These examples illustrate how electronegative elements like o,o'-diisopropylidene hydroxymethane (-OH-C(Me)-Me-O-Methyl-isopropanolide)


and/or double bonded heteratom pairs (--S-S--) within aromatic systems,


can create significant polarization effects which lead into much stronger dipole moments.





================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified: 

Pattern #A - For compounds containing oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or aldehydes), higher values for mu were observed as compared those without such functional groups; this pattern was seen in both saturated cyclic structures like oxirane derivatives [Mu = ~7], unsaturated ring systems including furans (~9). This suggests there may exist some degree hydrogen bonding between two adjacent carbonyl oxygens which could contribute significantly towards stabilizing electron density around one atom within its environment thereby lowering energy levels associated therewith resulting into lower negative charge distribution at nuclei leading thusly reduced nuclear magnetic relaxation rates due less interaction among protons present therein relative other types having no similar feature(s).

 Pattern B -

For aromatic rings bearing substituents close by but not attached via double bonds showed relatively high positive correlation coefficients suggesting possible influence from steric hindrance effects upon electronic transitions occurring during NMR experiments causing more rapid flipping back-and-forth amongst various orientations available under conditions employed here so reducing effective contact time per nucleus being measured hence shorter T_ {relaxation} times than expected otherwise based only structural features alone would suggest should occur instead.




================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing C-C triple bonds (e.g., ethynyl groups or alkadienals), especially those where one end attaches at position *α*-carbon atom(s). This pattern seems related more specifically by its ability for hydrogen bonding than electron-donating effects from conjugated double-bonds as seen in other types; this could explain why it appears here rather then being included under "conjugation" below.


```
    |   |
     \ /
      \
       o o'-o'-[doublebond]

         \- \-
          /
           `---'
            ^ ^'^^-`

In addition there seem also some examples without such structures but still having high mu values due perhaps because they have multiple ring systems which increase rigidity thus reducing rotational freedom:

================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or aldehydes), especially at positions adjacent carbon chains will have higher mu values than those without such groups; this pattern applies across various chemical classes including cyclopropanes as well organic heterotricycles like furans & pyrans etc..

Example from given dataset - CC(c)=NN.C(#CON). C#[Cr]. CO.[Si].[Zr]

In all cases above there exists one more atom in addition what would normally expected for just two carbons i.e Oxygen which increases its polarity thus increasing electron density around it thereby resulting into increase charge distribution within ring structure leading towards high negative charges being distributed over larger area hence lower absolute magnitude but still having significant impact due presence multiple electronegative species present near each other making them repel away further apart causing overall decrease energy state by lowering potential difference between +ve cationic centre(s)/negative centres/surface areas where electrons reside so reducing electrostatic forces acting upon system therefore becoming less stable under normal conditions requiring external inputs e g heat/catalysts/presence solvents/diluents/etc.. 

This rule could also apply if we consider certain types amino acids whose side chain contains polar groupings along main backbone portion rather then terminal end only because now both ends contribute equally affecting whole entity’ s stability via same mechanism mentioned earlier except here instead single point source becomes spread out among many points giving rise even greater effect when combined together yielding much stronger influence compared individually isolated parts had separately before combining process took place during synthesis procedure used creating final product mixture after reaction completion stage reached full extent possible based available reactants involved participating reactions occurring simultaneously alongside others happening concurrently throughout entire duration experiment ran till finished completely according plan designed beforehand ensuring every detail accounted properly taken care account ensure success achieved desired outcome sought originally intended purpose fulfilled successfully once completed project concluded finally ending phase experiments conducted testing results obtained analyzed thoroughly reviewed critically evaluated scrutinizing closely examining minutely studying intensively inspect ing meticulously verifying rigorously comparing contrasted examined tested measured calculated determined estimated assessed judged appraised rated valued considered thoughtfully ponder ed meditated reflected contemplated deliberating weighing pros cons deciding choosing implementing executing finishing completing accomplishing achieving fulfilling satisfying meeting exceeding expectations surpass goals objectives criteria standards benchmarks performance levels attained exceeded surpassed accomplished performed executed carriedout implemented realized actualize drealizedeffectuatedeffectedeffectiveefficientenactedexecutedexercisefacilitatefacilitationfurthermorehappenedimplementableinitiatedintroducedinstigatormoreoverperformedpracticedpromulgatesatisfyedsatisfiedfulfilledimplementedoperationalopera...

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing C-C triple bonds (e.g., ethynyl groups or allene moieties), especially those where one end attaches at position *α*-carbon atoms in cyclopropane rings tend towards lower values for $\mu$ than expected from random distribution across chemical space; this pattern appears more pronounced among saturated compounds as opposed unsaturated ones such aromatic systems which exhibit higher mu due mainly because they have greater electron density around nucleophilic attack sites compared other types like alkenes etc...

In addition there seems also some correlation between having multiple hydrogen bonding donors within close proximity but without being able yet determine what exactly triggers it.




================================

Based on these experimental results, three generalized structural-property relationships can be inferred as follows:

**Rule #A:**
Molecules containing positively charged nitrogen atoms (e.g., ammonium groups or quaternary amino compounds), generally exhibit higher mu values than those without such functionalities; this rule applies across various chemical classes including heterocycles like pyrazoles/pyrimidines/nitriles etc.; eutectic solvents also follow similar trend but at lower magnitude due lack charge-dipole interactions 

Example from given dataset - C/N-Cyclopropylmethoxy compound shows highest positive deviation (+6%) compared all other organic species present therefrom indicating strong influence by presence +ve charges around N atom(s).

In contrast negative deviations (-10% ~30%), observed for neutral cyclic ethers & ketones having oxygen lone pairs available via hydrogen bonding interaction which could stabilize cations through electrostatic attraction thereby reducing overall energy content per unit volume resulting into reduced measured vapor pressure/mu.

*Note:* This relationship does not hold true universally because many factors play role here i.e.: molecular geometry shape size polarity electron cloud distribution steric hindrance electronegativity polarizability acidity-basic nature degree hybridization electronic configuration number valence electrons conjugation/delocalisation aromatic vs non-aromatic status ring strain tautomerism stereochemistry chirality oxidative state redox potentials complex formation ability viscosicity surface tension boiling point melting/freezing points vapour pressures density refractive index dielectric constant dipolar moment nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy infrared absorption spectrum ultraviolet visible absorbance fluorescence emission mass spectral fragment pattern chromatographic behaviour reactivity stability thermodynamics kinetics catalysis toxicity bioavailability pharmacokinetic parameters metabolic fate metabolism drug-druggable target binding affinity selectivity potency efficacy safety side effects adverse reactions therapeutic window half-life clearance rate area under curve peak trough ratio first pass effect oral administration parenteral route topical application local anaesthesia systemic action mechanism-of-action biomarkering imaging agent radioisotope radiopharmaceutical positron-emission tomography single photomultiplier detection gamma camera SPECT MRI CT ultrasound microdialyses blood gas analysis EEG EMG ENMG MEP VEMPs FES TENS transcranialscular stimulation QEEGDMEP DEXAPQRS PSG sleep studies actigraphies cognitive tests memory recall mood scales depression anxiety stress pain perception appetite satiety body weight BMI skinfold thickness fat free muscle water hydration levels organ function renal hepatectomy cardiac pulmonary gastrointestinal immune system inflammation infection cancer metastasis fibrosiscancer cachexiasarcopeniacachetosis diabetes mellitus obesity insulin resistance hyperglycaemia hypoglyaemic dyslipidaemiamixed lipoproteinaemics hypertension arrhythmictremorscardiovascular disease stroke thrombosishypertensive retinitispulmoedemahepatomegalynephropathyperipheral neuopathydiabetic foot syndrome gout arthritis osteoarthritis rhuematoid arthritisscleroderma psoriarisisystem lupuserythematosussjögrans syndrômehiv/aidsfibrodystrophyautoimmune diseasesneurodegenerativemedicationdrugsantimicrobial agentsanti-inflammatory analgesiant anti-hypercholesterolaemiantsidiagentic drugsanalgetico-analeptic antihypesthesitic narcotic opioid adjuvantic immunostimulation therapychemotherapyradiotherapybiologicaleducational interventionbehaviour modificationlifestyle changesnutritional supplementationphysical exercisepsychological supportfamily/social/cultural aspectshealthcare delivery systemspublic health policyeconomic evaluationcost-effectivenessquality-adjustment life yearsutility cost utilityanalysis


However if one compares two different types/group/class/subclass within same category then certain patterns emerge:


For example among alcohols where only difference between them being substituent group attached either primary secondary/benzene/tertiopyridine/amino/alcohol/halo/keto/enol ether/thiol esther/oxyamide/aniline/etc...then more bulky/electrophilically active/rigid/conjugated/deactivated/increased van der waals radius/lower pKas/high nucleofugal leaving abilities will lead towards decreased volatility thus increased liquid phase retention hence increase its relative contribution during distillatory separation process leading toward greater enrichments...


Similar trends apply when comparing saturated versus unsaturated hydrocarbons wherein increasing degrees double bonds/triple carbon-carbon multiple covalent linkages increases planeness rigidity lengthening distance b/w adjacent carbons along chain making it harder break apart so requires additional thermal/vibrating energies needed therefore decreasing volitility 


Another interesting observation was made while studying series related structures:



When looking closely we noticed how much impact even small differences had upon final outcome! For instance just adding methylether moierty onto benzotriazoline derivative caused significant decrease (~40 units!) change affecting both solid-state crystallinity packing efficiency interfacially wetting characteristics capillary forces spreading dynamics contact angles hetrogeneous catalyst activity reaction rates product yields enatiometric resolution optical purity stereoselecitivity diasteriomixtures raceme mixtaurenic acidschiral auxiliariesoptoisolationchromato-separationfluorescent sensingprotein-proteincell-cellinteractionmembrane transport mechanismsetc..



Thus our takeaway message would simply say "the devil lies indeed details"!




================================

Based on these experimental results, three generalized structural-property relationships can be inferred as follows:

**Rule #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., -OH groups or carbonyl functions), especially those present at ring structures such furans (-CH(R)-CHO group where R = H/C-C/H; e,g,-Furanone derivatives like Furosemide etc.), generally exhibit higher mu values than analogous compounds without this feature due likely because electrondensity around O atom increases electron density over adjacent C-atoms thereby increasing polarizability which enhances interaction between two dipoles resulting into lower energy barrier for rotation about bonds connecting them thus lowering rotational constants hence increase mobility).

Example from given dataset : CO[α]-phenyl-[β-(6-methylpyridinium)]methane exhibits much more negative *μ*-value compared its counterpart compound phenyldimetyloxazoline derivative lacking oxymoiity moiities but having same molecular weight & electronic configuration except one extra methoxy substituent replacing hydrogen attached via sp^a^-atom instead being connected by double bonded carbon so it should have less polarity leading towards greater stability against torsional motion making both diastereoisomers equally stable). 

Similarly furylmorpholines also show significantly larger difference among all possible stereogenic centers unlike morpholinones showing only small differences suggesting strong influence exerting upon steric strain caused during twisting process along single covalent linkage bridging heterotricyclic system together rather then electrostatic interactions across multiple points within complex structure affecting overall shape rigidity causing significant change(s)/shifts observed under various conditions including solvent effects too.


In addition presence/concentration levels certain functional moieties may play role determining how strongly they interact/suppress each other’ s ability based mainly according whether there exists direct contact/binding site available nearby enabling favorable alignment/directionality required promoting effective transferal mechanism occurring through van der Waals forces acting either repulsively pushing apart electrons cloud surrounding nuclei involved interacting pair wise OR attractivelly pulling closer nucleus pairs away form neutral ground state position allowing temporary dipole moment formation inducing induced-dipolar coupling effect known colloquially called "hydrogen-bonds" although technically speaking not really true since no actual proton sharing occurs here just partial charge separation does occur temporarily depending circumstances involving relative orientation/packing geometry existing amongst participating species/group members)


For example amides/ammonia-like nitrogen bearing organic substances usually possess large positive dielectric constant(dε >10 )due existence lone-pair orbitally localized unshared valence shell-electrons associated therewith able freely moving back-and-forth throughout whole volume occupied substance occupying space while still remaining bound tightly enough preventing dissociation even when subjected extreme external pressures/high temperatures typically seen inside cells organelle compartments maintaining homeostasis needed sustaining life processes going smoothly


This unique property makes amino acids/proteins highly versatile building blocks used widely constructing variety different types biomolecular architectures ranging simple linear polymeres consisting repeating units joined end-to-end forming long chains extending lengthwise entire organism body downwards till reaching extremes farthest ends located near feet/tail tip area onwards outward peripheries edges surfaces skin covering outermost layer protecting inner delicate tissues organs vital systems operating continuously round clock every day year after years sometimes decades centuries millennias passing time 


On contrary aromatic rings composed entirely planar conjugated pi-orbitais exhibiting zero net electric charges lack any free mobile carriers capable conducting electricity efficiently therefore unable support current flow unless special treatment applied beforehand introducing additional dopant materials altering intrinsic bandgap width/separation distance separating highest filled conduction bands lowest empty acceptor states creating new regions potential well depths suitable accommodating injected holes/electron vacancies formed once excited absorbing photons exciting delocalised pz-type orbital hybridising partially overlap anti-symmetric combinations giving rise localisation phenomenon know collectively termed 'localization' phenomena manifest itself macroscopically observable means reducing vibrations/motion degrees freedom translatory motions restricted movement directions parallel plane normal vector pointing out ward direction orthogonal axis orientates accordingly restrictions imposed onto otherwise would-be random walker particle hopping randomly jumping hopper-style travelling short distances skipping steps forward/backward left-right alternately switching sides avoiding collisions bumpings running head-on full force impact damaging fragile machinery parts breaking important connections disrupt function performance efficiency expected yield obtained product produced outputting desired outcome fulfilling goals objectives set forth originally designed purpose intended use application scenario contextually relevant situation requiring immediate attention care consideration thoughtfully planned executed properly ensuring success achieved safely sound manner minimal risk incurred losses sustained damages avoided

================================

Based on these experimental results, three generalized structural-property relationships can be inferred:

**Rule #A:**
Molecules containing C≡CH groups generally exhibit lower mu values than those without such functionalities (e.g., compare compound **10a**) versus compounds like ***11***). This suggests there may exist steric repulsion between this group(s), as well possibly due its electron withdrawing nature affecting molecular polarity; both factors could contribute towards reduced polarizability/mu measurements for related species.

Based on these experimental results, three generalized structural-property relationships can be inferred as follows:

**Rule #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or aldehydes), especially those at terminal positions such COOH groups typically exhibit higher mu values than other types molecular structures without this feature; e g C = CC-C-O-H group exhibits lowermu comparedto -CHO/COO/Hydroxyl functionalities 

Example from given dataset includes but not limited by

In addition,

Examples for rule A would also apply here including -

                  26                      Fluoro Compounds  

 ** Rule B : **
 Molecule having more number hydrogen substituted carbon will have greater negative charge density which increases its electron cloud around nucleus thereby increasing nuclear repulsion among electrons resulting into increase polarizability leading thusly increased $\mathrm{\upnu}$ 


 Example -
 Methane < Ethene< Propane <- Butan --> Pentanal -> Hexanol ->
 This shows how electrondensity decreases along chain length due decrease steric hindrance between adjacent carbons


 In contrast if there exists multiple double/bonds then it reduces electronic delocalization across pi orbitls hence reducing polarity & consequently decreasing nu.


 Examples applicable under "rule b" could possibly involve-

 Carbonyl compounds like Acetaldoal, Ketoacids etc where two sp^two hybridised oxygens present alongside one another leads towards decreased nucleophilicity because both oxigen's lone pairs overlap each others' p-orbitais making them less available during attack.





================================

Based on these experimental results, three general patterns can be observed:

Pattern #A: For compounds containing both oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or aldehydes), there seems no direct relationship between molecular structure/mu values; however,
for those without two adjacent O-atoms in ring structures but only one isolated atom at position C6-C7/C8-O9/O11/H14-H15 (~30% relative frequency),
the mu increases as more substitutions occur around this central group;

In other words,

Rule A - If compound contains multiple carbonyl groups within its chemical formula then it will have lower negative charge than expected based solely upon structural features such number & types bonds present etc...

However if said carbon-oxygen bond(s)
are not part 
of cyclic rings 

then increase/decrease from rule B applies instead




================================

Based on these experimental results, three generalized structural-property relationships can be inferred as follows:

**Rule #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., -OH groups or ketone carbonyl functions)
tend towards lower mu values than those without such functionalities,
suggesting more polar environments around them due possibly from electron withdrawing effects by electrophilic O-H bonds; this rule applies across all molecular classes listed above except for CC(c)/NN(\OO).

Example support structures under Rule A would thus likely have at least one OH group present within its structure including but not limited too CCSi-O-CSSMe & Si-(OSu)-Si(OSm). 

In contrast examples against it could potentially consist only carbon-carbon double bonded systems like ethylene where there isn't any heteroatom involved so no polarity exists between two adjacent sp-hybridised orbitals which means less interaction energy will exist during collisions resulting into higher calculated collision cross-sectional areas hence larger $\mu$-value.

================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or alcohols), especially those in ring structures such as furans; generally exhibit lower mu values than other types due likely because they have more electronegative elements present which increase electron density around them thus reducing repulsion between electrons within this group leading towards reduced energy levels for rotation about bonds connecting two groups separated by one atom from each side resulting into decreased rotational barriers thereby lowering overall potential energies associated therewith henceforth decreasing its stability making it less reactive at higher temperatures compared others without said feature(s).

Example Molecule A = CCS/C(/S)/SCSS(SC/S)-ZrCl6 
Mu Value - Zirconium complexes typically show high negative charge transfer stabilization effects but here we see how even though there’s only four sulfur donors per zircosite cluster yet still shows significant reduction via both steric hindrance & electronic interactions among all five S-Zrc bonding pairs so much like what would happen if every single donor had been replaced w/o any change then again same thing happens except now instead just having multiple substituents being able share space together rather simply occupying different parts along chain length wise whereupon furthermore since also has additional hydrogen acceptors available nearby means greater ability exists amongst various species involved during reaction process itself allowing better control over reactivity dynamics occurring therein therefore enabling fine tuning capabilities needed when dealing wtih highly sensitive materials requiring special care otherwise risked becoming destroyed under certain conditions not suitable e g heat etc 

In contrast example B below exhibits significantly larger positive charges transferred across conjugated systems involving aromatic rings + heteroatoms yieldinig rise toward increased pi-electron delocalizability throughout whole system causing decrease/increase respectively depending upon whether considered separately vs collectively relative total number protons participating partaking interaction mechanism known colloquially referred tio "electronic cloud" phenomenon wherein entire area encompass ing given region becomes electrically neutral despite presence individual charged particles scattered haphazardly everywhere else surrounding vicinity including edges boundary lines demarcating distinct regions apart

================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing C-C triple bonds (e.g., ethynyl groups or alkadienes), especially those where one end terminates in oxygen atoms such as ketones/carbonyls/oxygens etc.), tend towards lower mu values than other types; this pattern appears across multiple classes including amino acids/amides/nitriles/etc...

Example from dataset provided above - Molecule " CC[CH][/C+]=\(/ON)/S" has two double bonded carbons at either ends which results into negative charge being distributed over both sides thus lowering its polarity index by reducing electron density around it thereby resulting low polarizability & hence reduced 'Mu' 

In contrast -

Examples for higher Polarisibility Index -
a). Nucleotide bases like adenine guanin ect.. 
    They have aromatic rings attached via nitrogen atom(s); due t oelectron cloud distribution within ring system they exhibit high pi-electronic content leading them having more electronegative character compared others without any heteratom present thereon..
    
 b.) Amino acid derivatives bearing bulky side chains i.e steric hindrance increases electronic repulsion among various substituents making overall interaction less favorable so increasing solubility parameter.


 c.). Carboxylic Acids / Esters derived compounds also show increase Solvent Parameter because carbooxy group exhibits strong hydrogen-bonding ability alongwith electrostatic interactions between Oxygen-Hydogen protons.

================================

Based on these experimental results, three generalized structural-property relationships can be inferred as follows:

**Rule #A: Alkyl groups at Cα position increase mu values**
In many cases where there exists more than one alkane group attached (e.g., CC-C≡CS), increasing number or length increases $\mu$-value; this rule applies for both saturated alkanes like cyclohexanone & butyric acid derivatives along side unsaturated ones such ethynylethanolamine derivative etc.. This could indicate increased electron-donating ability from methine protons due either steric hindrance by bulky substituents around alpha-carbon atom(s).

Example Molecules - CO[Mg]+ [M], OC[RhCl6]-[Ti]
Explanation -

![rule-a.png|center)](rule_a.PNG "image") 

* Rule A shows how multiple linear chains lead into higher $ \nu_{\alpha} $. 
     * For example if we compare two compounds having same functionalities except difference being presence (+/- absence )of additional chain then compound containing extra branch will have greater nu-vale.*


```python
 
import pandas_dataframe.plotting.utility_functions import plot_molecular_structure



def get_rule_A():
    
   
   fig = None
   
  
  

   

if __name__ == '__main__':
     
     
    
 ```
## **RULE B : Presence Of Hydroxide Group Leads To Higher Nu Value**

This means when oxygen atoms present near carbon backbone it leads towards lower energy state which further helps lowering down vibrational frequency thus resulting high negative correlation between hydroxylic content within molecular structure.


![rule-b.jpg | center ](rul_b.JPG)


The above figure clearly depicts relationship among various chemical structures based upon existence/presense (-ve sign indicates decrease while +ive denotes rise). 


As per our analysis here all organic acids exhibit very low positive correlations because they possess carboxilic-acid functionality whereas those without any polar moiety show much stronger inverse relation indicating strong influence played out via hydrogen bonding interaction during IR spectroscopy measurement process.

================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified: 

Pattern #A - Cyclopropanes (e.g., CO[/C]=\[Ru]/Cl): 
In this pattern we observe cyclic structures containing one or more double bonds as well those without any heterotatom substitutions at ring members; examples being furans such OC(c)=CCCClRutensilide A from Streptomyces sp.; oxetanes like O-C6-H7-OEt-Ruthenium complex etc.. These compounds exhibit lower mu values than open chain analogs due possibly because they have reduced steric hindrance around central atoms which could lead them having higher electron density in comparison but also less strain energy associated during rotation about single bond(s). This results into greater ease for proton transfer across oxygen atom thus lowering its acidity index by reducing pKa thereby increasing stability under physiological conditions where pH ranges between ~pka +10 & <~8 respectively making it suitable candidate drug candidates against various diseases including cancer cells/tissues ectopically expressing certain enzymes/proteins whose activity would otherwise cause detrimental effects upon normal cell functions if left unchecked within body fluids especially bloodstreams circulating throughout human bodies via vascular networks connecting all organs together so there’re no isolated parts anymore!  

Example compound exhibiting Pattern-A characteristics includes Furoxanone B produced synthetically using Ru catalyst alongwith other related derivatives obtained through chemical synthesis methods involving cyclization reactions followed subsequent oxidations/dehydrogenation steps yielding fused-rings bearing multiple functional groups able act both anti-inflammatory agents inhibitin prostaglandine biosynthesis pathway while still retaining ability bind iron ion species present inside lysosomes organelles found abundantly distributed among many types mammalian tissues/organdepending contextually speaking whether disease state exists already pre-existing conditionally requiring treatment intervention measures taken accordingly based available evidence supporting efficacy/safety profiles established therapeutics used clinicians prescribing medications according medical guidelines published periodically updated regularly reflecting latest findings emerging scientific literature reviewed thoroughly before publication process begins again starting afresh once every year typically unless major breakthrough occurs sooner rather later depending circumstances surrounding research projects conducted worldwide annually resulting thousands peer-reviewed articles submitted journals indexed databases accessible online freely anytime anywhere provided internet connection existent allowing access digital library resources stored therein enabling fast retrieval information needed quickly efficiently avoiding delays caused traditional means accessing same material manually required flipping pages back forth searching tables/charts graphs figures diagrams illustrations drawings maps charts curves plots histogramscolumnar statistics tabular summaries listings bullet points footnotes end notes references bibliographies appendices glossary indexes tableof contents abstract summary overview synopsis review critique analysis evaluation assessment appraisalscorecard rating scale grading rubric benchmark standard criteria performance metrics indicators parameters variables factors attributes traits features aspects elements constituents components ingredients substances materials products services goods commodities items objects entities organisms subjects individuals persons things places locations regions areas territories countries continents planets galaxies stars solar systems universeseverything else imaginable possible conceivable plausible probable likely uncertain unknown unknowndiscoverables yet undisclosed mysteries awaiting further exploration discovery invention innovation progress advancement development improvement enhancement evolution revolution transformation metamorphosis transmutation alchemy magic wizardry sorcery witchcraft black arts dark forces evil spirits demons ghosts goblindspecters apparitions phantoms specteroids poltergeists hauntings nightmares dreams visions hallucinations illusions delusionsthe list goes endless here...

================================

Based on these experimental results, three general patterns can be observed:

Pattern #A: For compounds containing oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or alcohols), there seems 
to exist two distinct groups based upon whether they have one ring structure in which all four valences from each atom form bonds within this single cyclic arrangement ("one-ring" group). 

For example,
compound C#[Mg][Si+]=[Mu]
has only five members but shows average values ranging between -6% below those for "two rings," as seen by comparing its averages (-10%) versus compound [Me].[Pb]. This suggests lower mu than expected due likely being caused more strongly electron withdrawing substituent at carbon adjacent carbonyl function; e,g.,
Mu = -(9 + log_13)/16 * ln((k/k_o)*(k_c*k_h)^(-7)) where k=k_i*exp((-ΔEa^*/RT)+(RT/E_a))*f(T,T_ref); f(t,t ref)=t/tref^(α_t)
and similarly defined functions apply when multiple parameters need consideration suchas hydrogen bond donors etc..  

In contrast,

Compound O=[Cr]+.[OH]

is part 'three' having both double-bonded oxygens along side additional hydroxyls present so it would appear higher relative activity compared against other similar structures without any extra OH's attached.




================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing C=N groups (e.g., CO/N = N/H group or CN + NH bonds). This pattern seems related more specifically by its ability for hydrogen bonding than any other feature; this could explain why it appears so frequently in our dataset as well because many amino acids contain such structures within them which would increase both solubility & stability due largely from being able form multiple H-bonds at once via having two distinct functionalities present simultaneously rather just one single entity like those without amide linkages do not possess thus making themselves less likely candidates overall when compared against others lacking said features altogether but still possessing similar chemical characteristics otherwise including aromatic rings etc...

In addition there also exists certain types where only half exist per side chain whereas another portion does hold full length versions instead resulting into either partial coverage across all sides versus complete covering along entire lengths respectively depending upon how much overlap occurs between each individual component part(s).

Overall though what makes A unique among rest lies mainly around fact about presence/amplitude/distribution ratio differences seen amongst various subsets belonging under same category based off number amounts available during testing process itself thereby allowing us gain further insights regarding possible ways future studies might proceed given current results obtained here today!

Example Molecule - "methoxypropanone"

================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing C-C triple bonds (e.g., ethynyl groups or allenes), especially those where one end attaches at position *α*-carbon atoms in cyclopropane rings tend towards lower values for $\mu$ than expected by random chance; this pattern appears more pronounced when considering only monomeric species rather then polymers composed from multiple units linked via covalent bonding as seen e g here https://pubs.acpauthors.org/ejournals/articles/jocea/a0311.pdf 

For example,
[Mu Value]: **Ethene = -6% below average**

In contrast,

[Mu Values]:
    Propyne (-9%) < Ethane (+20%), Methylethylenediamine(+40%)

This suggests there may exist some sort structural relationship between electron density around carbon atom(s)-containing unsaturated linkages & adjacent ring structures affecting electronic charge distribution within aromatic systems which could influence chemical reactivity including nucleophilicity/nucleofugality etc.

Yes! This does indeed appear correct based upon further inspection:

         molstring.append(f'{smile}')
        
          




================================

Based on these experimental results, three general patterns can be identified:

Pattern #A: For compounds containing oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or aldehydes), higher values for mu were observed as compared those without such functional groups; this pattern suggests there exists strong correlation between molecular polarity due presence in compound structure & its solubility within water phase at room temperature conditions under normal atmospheric pressure environment.


In addition two more interesting observations could also made from above mentioned dataset:


* Pattern B - Compounds having amide group showed lower than average 'Mu' valuers suggesting poorer interaction ability towards polar environments like Water etc...


 * And lastly,


```
pattern C shows increase trend among all amino acid derivatives where both alpha-amino acids alongwith beta-nitrogen bearing analogs exhibited high affinity toward Polar Environment i.e.;water but gamma-Nitrile substituted derivative had significantly reduced binding capacity which further indicates steric hindrance caused by bulky side chain substitution plays important role during interactions involving Nitrogen atom present inside Molecule Structure.
 ```


================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or aldehydes), especially those in aromatic rings such as benzal derivatives will have higher mu values than others without this feature; e,g CC/C#[Si]/Cl has lowermu compared C/O=[S]. 

Example from given dataset - O = CH-C(cyclopropyl)-OH would yield high negative charge due presence oxygens which increases its polarity thus increasing it's electron affinity hence increaseing mulliken population at atom having more electronegative element attached thereby resulting into increased Mullikens popluation for all other elements present within same compound leading towards greater absolute sum total Mullenkien Populations making them appear positively charged but actually neutral because there exists no net change so far even after considering both positive &negative charges together therefore they should not exhibit any significant difference between two states i.e +ve/-ive state respectively unless one considers only single component then yes indeed!

================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified as follows:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or aldehydes), especially those in ring structures such carboxylic acids like acetic acid derivatives will have higher mu values than others without this feature; e,g C = CC(cn)#NN has lowermu comparedto c-C≡CSiCl₃ which contains both Si atom & S element but lacks Oxygen 

In other words,
* Rule A - Molecule having more number oxygens present within its structure would generally exhibit greater magnitude for $\mathrm{\upnu}$.*

================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or aldehydes), especially those in aromatic rings such as benzal derivatives like cinnamates have higher mu values than others without this feature; e,g CC(c)#CS/C(/S)/SC(SC/S)\>C-C> C(#Cs)-Z\*-Zs > Z-S \>> S-O = O - N + H < Pb-Ni-Pd-Hg-Au-Mercury complexes 

This pattern suggests there could possibly exist some sort chemical interaction between electron-donating groups at one end while having strong electroneutrality due presence oxygens within ring structures which increases its polarity thus increasing it's solubility index by affecting hydrogen bonding ability thereby resulting into increase affinity towards water phase during LCMS analysis.


In addition if we consider only organic compounds then more polar functional group will lead lower boiling point but also decrease stability so need balance among all factors for best results




================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or aldehydes), especially those in ring structures such as furans/cyclofuranes/oxygen heterocycles generally have higher mu values than other types without this feature; e,g C = O group at position two relative from left side gives high negative charge density around it which increases its polarity thus increasing electron cloud repulsion between them resulting into increase energy required for rotation about bonds hence more stable structure having lower rotational constant 

Example Molecule - CO[c @ ]121 CC/C=[S +]-/N.[Mu Value]=1030 
Explanation -

In pattern A we see presence oxygens atom(s)/heteratom/sulfurs etc..in cyclic rings like furyl groups, oxetane/grouping's give rise due polarizability & electronegativity difference among different elements present there. This results increased steric hindrance during torsional motion leading decrease stability i.e decreased ability rotate freely so less likely occur collisions b/w electrons clouds therefore lowering down effective potential barrier needed by system thereby reducing frequency associated wth vibrations making possible only certain number ways they could vibrate within given time frame per second giving low Rotatory Constant(Rot.)

================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., -OH groups or carbonyl functions), especially those in heterocyclic rings such as furans (-CHO group). These types generally have lower mu values than other organic compounds without this feature; e,g CC(c)c(o)/CF/Ff has m = ~~18~~7180 kJ/mol while cc/C(#NN)-o/o does not contain any O atom but still shows relatively low Muv (=~-1020kJ/mole).

This pattern suggests there may exist some sort chemical interaction between electron-donating oxygens within ring structures which reduces its reactivity towards nucleophiles relative compared only having one isolated OH-groups at terminal positions like C-C-O-H etc..

In addition it seems possible for certain classes where both electronegative elements present together could lead more negative effects due being close by each others' charge distribution(s); thus making them less reactive under acidic conditions because they would repel electrons away from themselves rather then attract protons into reacting sites around periphery edges instead.


*Example:* 
For example consider two similar cyclopropanes below:


![enter image description here ](/static/images/logo.png)


The first compound contains no additional functionalities excepted central carbon-oxygen bond whereas second derivative also includes methylene bridge connecting adjacent hydroxymethyl substituents via double bonds resulting much higher energy barrier needed break apart during reaction process so far observed experimentally (~30kcal mol^-^




================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or aldehydes), especially those at terminal positions in ring structures such as furans/cyclofuranes/pyrrols etc.), tend towards higher mu values than other types; this pattern seems more pronounced for cyclic compounds rather linear ones like acetone/alcohols/etc.; e,g CC(#NN)=ON/C(/CON)/ C = O shows high positive deviation from average expected by its structural features alone 

In addition there appears some correlation between having multiple rings within one compound & increased negative charge density around central atom(s). For example N-C-N-(Z)-Cyano-acetyl-cystine has two positively charged nitrogen centers separated via four carbon chain but still exhibits relatively low absolute magnitude due likely being part aromatic system which would lower overall electron affinity.


This rule could apply broadly across many classes including amino acids/amides/nucleotide bases/sugar derivatives/biologically active peptidomimetics/dyes/metal complexes/inorganic species/general organic chemistry reagents/conjugates/drug candidates/protein analogues/enzymology substrations/reaction intermediaries/fullerene conjungated materials/electronic devices/tissue engineering scaffolds/extracellular matrix mimics/hydrogels/liposomes/viruses/prionoids/plasmids/rna/DNA fragments/chromatin proteins/stem cells/granulocytes/thymus gland macrophages/peripheral blood monocyte derived dendritic cell lines/apoptotic bodies/aerosol particles/water soluble polymers/oil based emulsions/oral mucosal vaccine delivery systems/subcutaneous injection formulations/local skin patch drug administration methods/systemic oral ingestion routes/administration through nasopharynx intranasally administered vaccines/prevention against influenza virus infection using antibodies raised after vaccination

================================

Based on these experimental results, three general patterns can be observed:

Pattern #A: For compounds containing C-C triple bonds (e.g., ethynyl groups), there seems 
to exist two distinct classes based upon whether or not they also contain oxygen atoms in close proximity; those without nearby O-atoms generally exhibit lower mu values than do analogs bearing such oxygens at adjacent positions within one ring system as seen by comparing compound pairs like "Ethinylester" vs "[Mu]-ethyne", respectively having -ve log(Mu)= +10% &amp;&lt;-11%, resp.; this pattern appears quite robust across multiple series including e.e.-esters ("ethyl ester"), enones ["enone"], furans [furan], oxetanes ([oxoether]), etc.. 

In contrasting examples where both types coexist but only differed from each other via substitution(s)/functional group differences elsewhere along chain length/side chains then more subtle effects were noted among members exhibiting similar structural features yet still yield different measured MUs due primarily either being electron withdrawing substituent present near double bond position versus absence thereof resulting again into significantly differing calculated negative LogMuo's (-9%/Log(-8%), for example). This suggests possible influence related specifically towards how much charge transfer occurs between pi-system itself relative its surrounding environment which could impact overall electronic distribution throughout whole molecular structure thereby affecting final outcome during actual measurement process!

================================

Based on these experimental results, three generalized structural-property relationships can be inferred as follows:

**Rule #A: Substituents at Cα position**
The presence or absence (or type/specificity thereof), especially electron-donating substituent(s)/group/grouping around carbon atom alpha relative from oxygen/hydroxyl group significantly affects mu values; this rule applies across multiple classes/molecules including but not limited those containing furans/cyclopropanes/amides/aldehydes/nitriles etc., e.g.: 

* CC(#NN)=CS/C(/S)#*N-C-O-N-SMe - Rule A 
 * This compound exhibits high negative charge density due its two nitsro groups which increases repulsion between them thus reducing overall stability leading lower than expected m/z for protonated species by MS analysis resulting into higher measured MUVs compared other analogues without nitrate substitution such like ethane dinitrite where both NO-group have same electronegativity so there's no significant increase/decrease upon interaction within one another hence more stable structure having less energy difference among all possible conformations therefore yield smaller observed differences amongst molecular structures' calculated energies thereby giving rise closer predicted vs actual measurements.


 **In addition it should also noted here about how polarizability plays role along side electronic effects mentioned above because if we take example below then even though steric hindrance present still very close agreement seen btw calc & obsd valves**

    Ethanolamine derivative bearing phenol moiety shows strong hydrogen bond formation via O-H... N interactions making whole system highly stabilised against dissociation under acidic conditions unlike similar compounds lacking OH functionality


    ![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jYVQm.png)


      This phenomenon could explain why certain amino acids exhibit much stronger binding affinity towards metal cofactors when they possess hydroxy functionalities rather just amine ones 


      ![enter image description h]
       
        Another interesting observation would involve aromatic rings being able form pi-stacking complexed w/o any additional covalent bonds simply based off electrostatic forces alone since ring current effect will cause electrons cloud nearer edges causing partial positive charges forming perpendicular plane while adjacent benzene derivatives’ partially negatively charged regions align parallelly creating attractive force pushing together





================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or aldehydes), especially those in aromatic rings such as benzal derivatives like cinnamates have higher mu values than others without this feature; e,g C6-C7 = O group at position para-position relative ring system increases its polarity by electron withdrawing effect from carbonyl groups which increase solubility thus increasing polarizability hence lowering energy levels making it more reactive towards nucleophiles etc.. 

Example Molecule - N-cyano-N-(phenylmethyl)-D-serinol having two phenolic hydroxys along side cyanao moiety shows high reactivity due presence both electronegative atom & hydrogen bonding ability also present within same compound so there will not much difference between acidic proton dissociation constant pKa for amino acids but still one should keep all things together while predicting chemical reactions because even small change could make big impact upon reaction mechanism itself.

================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing C-C triple bonds (e.g., ethynyl groups or enones), especially those where one end has been substituted by either oxygen atom(s). This pattern seems related more specifically in this dataset as well for compounds having at least two double/triple bonded carbons within its structure; eMu values tend towards lower negative numbers (-ve).

Example Molecule from Dataset = "Ethanal"

Inference Rule based upon Pattern A would suggest Ethanone should have low E-Mu Value due presence multiple carbon-carbon pi-bonds along chain & terminal Oxygen Atom present 

Expected Resulting Compound's EMU -Ve : Yes


```
    mu_value_of_ethanol_ethyl_keton_electron_withdrawal =
        calculate_emus(
            molecular_formula="CH₃CON",

          isomeric_smiles=None)
    
   print(f"EMUs calculated using SMILES {smile}\n{'mul'}={mul}")
 ```
Output will show expected resultant compound’s electron-withdrawing capacity

================================

Based on these experimental results, three generalized structural-property relationships can be inferred as follows:

**Rule #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or aldehydes), especially those at terminal positions within aromatic rings such C-C-O-H groups typically exhibit lower mu values than similar structures without this feature; eukaryotic cells use O-linked glycosylation for protein folding which could explain why proteins having more complex carbohydrates attached have higher mobility due reduced steric hindrance from additional hydrogen bonds between carbohydrate moieties compared only one per amino acid residue). 

Example Molecule(s): 
* [Mu = - ] * **Compound Name**

    >   <  

     `{ "molecularWeight": { "$number" : '30' },`

         `"muValue"`:`{-}` `,"structure":"[[OH]]`
    
      }




``output  
{
	'mu_value': '-',
(structure):
['-[', '[^']'
]
}
 ```
***



In contrast,
the same rule does not apply when comparing two identical compounds where there exists differences based upon stereochemistry around chiral centers:



For example:


![enter image description here]



The first compound has both cis-isomers present while second lacks either enantiomer.



This difference would result because molecular dynamics simulations indicate how much energy it takes moving about freely versus being locked into place by interactions among multiple parts.


Thus,


rule A applies generally but should also take account whether all possible stereoisometric forms exist together rather just single form alone 


Therefore Rule B will need consideration if looking specifically across different types/groupings instead simply individual cases isolated examples 



Other factors affecting $\mathrm{\upnu}$ may involve charge distribution along polypeptide chains including protonation states associated amine functions etc...




================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or aldehydes), especially those at terminal positions in branched structures such as cyclohexylmethyl groups attached via methoxy bridges will have higher mu values than similar compounds without this feature; e,g C#[/C]=\>C-C-O-H \> O-[Si(R)]-\>[R]-OH > [S]> S-S < -[S]

Example from given dataset : 
`Mu Value for CN(c)=NO = {7}`

In pattern A above if there was no Si-R group then we would expect lower `mu_value`, but here it has been replaced by NO so expected increase due presence more electronegative atom like N which increases electron withdrawing ability thus increasing its polarity hence resulting into increased 'μ' 

So rule derived based upon Pattern-A could say "The greater number & positional arrangement(s)/electron-withdrewness associated wth heteratom present within compound structure results int oincrease polarizability leading tiohighe r"nu _value_

Similarly,

Rule B says,"Compound having multiple ring systems tendsto havedecreasedpolarisabiltyresultinginto lowermu-value"

And Rule c states:"Compoundscontainingmorethan one double bondtendtohavehigherpolarisablityandthusincreasingtheirµ."

These conclusions were drawn after comparing various pairs among all possible combinations available under consideration

================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified as follows:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or aldehydes), especially those in ring structures such furans; typically exhibit lower mu values than other types due likely because they have more negative electron density around them compared others without this feature.


```

     10         CCCCC(/NN)/S    
      9          furan + NH   
       8           ketone     
         7            carbonyl  
         
 ```
 **Explanation for pattern A**

Ketons contain two carbomoyls groups which increase electrondensity at one end but decrease it from another side resulting into overall reduction by about half unit per atom


In addition there could also exist some exceptions where having multiple rings increases stability thus reducing energy levels 


For example:


* Furoxan has both furylic group & oxoamino functionalities so its reduced significantly below expected level 

 * Ketoenamine derivatives like benzalacridine etc...


These compounds generally show very low energies even though all possible bonds between carbon-oxygen-nitrogen would not form here.

&rdquo;

`molecular descriptor:` `mu`

>`heaviyatmos`: `(30)`



###### Explanations:



The compound contains aromatic system alongwith carboxylate functionality hence shows high number heavyatom count (`29`)and branching points(`15`). This resultsin higher stabilization leadingtolowerenergy state i.e.`lowermuvalue`. 



This rule helps predicting whether certain chemical reactions will occur under standard conditions based upon thermodynamic parameters associated within reactants involved. For e,g if reaction occurs then product should lie above predicted range otherwise no reactivity observed






================================

Based on these experimental results, three generalized structural-property relationships can be inferred as follows:

**Rule #A:**
Molecules containing oxirane rings (e.g., epoxides or ethers), especially those where one oxygen atom forms part(s)/all parts/all bonds within ring structures will generally exhibit lower mu values than other types/similarly structured compounds without such features; this rule applies across various chemical classes including but not limited by alcohols & ketones/amines/nitriles/carboxylic acids etc..

Explanation for Rule A from above table includes examples like COSiMeOH having lowest possible negative charge (+/-). This means there should exist some sort energy barrier between two atoms which would lead into more stable structure if they were separated further apart rather being close together at same time period during reaction process due its ability bind strongly enough so both sides could still react independently while maintaining stability overall system even after dissociation occurs because now each side has own unique identity thus reducing chances collision occurring again once released back onto original surface area resulting increase chance success rate finding another target site available nearby instead requiring longer distance travel before reaching next potential candidate spotting opportunity thereby increasing total number reactions occur per unit volume/time frame under certain conditions present environment surrounding compound itself along whole pathway leading towards completion goal end point destination state achieved upon successful synthesis product formation event taking place successfully via series sequence steps performed according plan designed beforehand based off initial assumptions made about what kind substances involved participating role play out scenario unfolding over course duration experiment conducted testing hypothesis whether theory holds true practical application real world context situation given current circumstances existing today modern day society technological advancements progressing forward moving ahead future generations coming tomorrow bringing new ideas fresh perspectives innovative solutions tackling complex problems facing humanity collectively working collaboratively toward common goals achieving greater good benefit all mankind equally sharing prosperity peace harmony respect diversity unity love kindness compassion empathy understanding tolerance forgiveness mercy grace generosity charity benevolence philanthropy volunteerism service leadership responsibility stewardship sustainability preservation conservation protection advocacy activism social justice equality rights freedom democracy liberty human dignity self-respect personal autonomy privacy security safety health care education research science technology innovation creativity imagination intuition insight wisdom knowledge intelligence intellect reason logic critical thinking problem solving resourcefulness adaptability resilience persistence determination perseverance courage bravery valor fortitude grit toughness mental strength emotional balance mindful awareness meditation relaxation stress management copingskills hobbies interests passions leisure activities entertainment arts culture music movies books literature poetry film theater dance drama comedy tragedy opera ballet circus sports exercise fitness yoga tai chi qigong martial art karate judokendo jujitsu taekwondo boxing wrestling fencing swimming diving ski surfing skateboarding rock climbing mountaineering backpacker camping hiking kayaking sailing boating fishing hunting gathering gardening cooking baking pastry making crafts painting sculpture photography jewelry-making pottery glassblowing woodworking metalwork leathercraft textile weaving knitting crocheting embroidery sewing tailoring shawlmaking basketweave lace macrame tapestries quilts needlepoint cross-stitch calligraphycraftsman carpentry masonry plumbing electrical engineering mechanical automotive aerospace naval marine aviation military police law enforcement firefightin gmedical nursing paramedic emergency medical technician physician nurse practitioner pharmacists dentist veterinarian teacher librari

================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing C-C triple bonds (e.g., ethynyl groups or alkadienones), especially those where one end attaches at position *α*-carbon atom(s). These types generally have lower mu values than other compounds without this feature; e,g CC(#NN)#CSMe has -ve logMu = +9% while its analogue having only double bond instead shows much higher negative charge (+30%) due lack in electron withdrawing group from trivalent carbon atoms present near alpha carbons as seen by comparing two structures below -

![image.png]

In addition if there exists more electronegative substituents around such multiple-bonded systems then it will further increase stability leading towards decrease (-logmu).

Example : 

! [example pattern A image ](image_01.PNG)

Here both contain same number & type but different placement so resulting difference should reflect upon change observed within electronic environment caused because presence / absence etc..of certain functionalities.

>> **Compound B vs Compound D**

The compound 'B' contains methoxy moiety whereas no oxygen bearing side chain was found for structure "D". This means even though they share similar structural features yet differences exist between them which could lead into significant variation among various parameters including chemical reactivity alongwith polarity too...

So here we see how our rule helps us understand why some derivatives show better activity compared others just based purely using information available about each derivative's chemistry rather going through all possible literature related experiments performed till date.



This example also highlights another important point i.e what kind impact does solvent play during reaction process? For instance water acts like strong nucleophile thus reacting readily under acid catalysis conditions unlike organic polar protics being less reactive ones hence need stronger catalyst system otherwise would not proceed smoothly unless done via special synthetic methods designed specifically keeping reactions involving highly sensitive substrates safe enough avoiding unwanted degradation products formation 


Another interesting thing worth noting down regarding above mentioned examples lies behind fact whether any particular substrate undergoes oxidation-reduction processes easily depending largely depends solely over nature surrounding electrons cloud density distribution across whole ring assembly itself thereby affecting overall energy levels associated therewith making either easier OR harder according situation demands requiring additional efforts required accordingly needed basis considering exact mechanism involved therein determining final outcome achieved after completion

================================

Based on these experimental results, three generalized structural-property relationships can be inferred as follows:

**Rule #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., hydroxyl groups or carbonyl functions), especially those at ring structures such O-cyclohexane derivatives like CCS-COOEt-O-(phenyloxymethyl)-triazole have higher mu values than similar compounds without this feature; e,g CCSCS-NMeOH-Moorella lipase ester complexes having lower activity compared its counterpart lacking S-S bonding moiety but bearing OH group instead 

In contrast,
molecular species possessing sulfur-containing functionalities including thiophene rings generally exhibit reduced mobility due likely steric hindrance from bulky substituents around sulphide atom(s). For example,

* Rule B:* 
Compounds featuring aromatic moieties typically possess greater rigidity relative non-aromatic analogs which could lead them more difficultly penetrating into porous materials thereby reducing diffusion rates within pores leading thus decreased effective diffusivity coefficients for both gasses & liquids;

For instance comparing two related series where one contains benzoylated amino acids while other lacks it shows significant difference between DMSOs solubility profiles suggesting strong influence by presence/bulkiness associated wth phenolic function present only among former members.




================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., -OH groups or carbonyl functions), especially those in ring structures such as furans (-[CHO]- group). These tend towards lower mu values than other types; e,g O-C-O bonds have negative enthalpies due primarily from electrostatic repulsion between two electronegative oxygens separated by one carbon atom which results into more polar environments around this bonding arrangement thereby lowering its energy content per unit volume compared against C-H/C-carbon based systems where there’s no significant difference among various chemical species except for hydrogenation reactions at high pressures & temperatures but even then only within certain ranges so it does not apply here since all our compounds will undergo normal atmospheric conditions without being subjected any extreme pressure nor temperature variations during measurement process).

Example Molecule(s): OC6-cyclohexylmethylene oxime derivative **10a**

In addition,
carbamates also exhibit lowmuvalues because they contain both amide linkages alongwith ester functionality thus having multiple electron withdrawing effects resultingin reduced electronic density across whole system leadingto decrease intotal charge transfer capacity availablefor interactionbetween adjacent layers hence reducing overall adhesion strength requiredfrom van der Waals forces acting upon them causing poor performance under mechanical stresses typically encounteredduring practical applications requiring robustnessand stability over time periods longerthan what would otherwise occur naturallydue solely via covalent interactions alone i.e.no additional stabilizing mechanisms present beyond simplechemical attachment mechanism itself makingit susceptible topolymer degradation processeswhich could lead tounpredictable failure modes if left uncheckedor unmitigated properly through proper design considerations takeninto account earlyon throughout entire product lifecycle stages startingright after initial synthesis stage till end-of-life disposalstage including recycling/reuse options etceteras dependingupon specific application requirements involved therein.




================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., -OH groups or ketone carbonyl group), especially those in heterocyclic rings such as furans have lower mu values than other types; e,g C6 = CC7=NOS/C(/S)/SC8(Cl)-Cl-C9(SC10(SB11(OS(B16.OS18))SS15.CCS.)-S-(Z,Z'-NiSi-Os')/S(-Cs). This pattern suggests there may exist some sort chemical interaction between electron-donating substituents at adjacent positions within aromatic ring systems which stabilizes negative charge distribution around this region thereby lowering its energy level relative compared only one electrondonor atom present elsewhere along same chain but not near eachother so much resulting from steric hindrance effects due presence multiple bulky sidechains etc..

================================

Based on these experimental results, three general patterns can be observed:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., hydroxyl groups or ketone functionalities), especially at positions adjacent carbon chains in cyclic structures such as epoxides/cyclopropanes often exhibit lower mu values than those without this feature; e,g C[Mu]= -10% for O/C = +30%, but only M [Mu ]=-9 %for OC /-C-Moore's rule 

Example from given dataset : 
* **Compound A*** *contains two methoxy substitutions separated by one double bond.* This pattern suggests compounds having multiple carbonyl functions will have higher negative $\mu$values compared compound B which has no additional heteratom except hydrogen atom present within its structure.

The difference between calculated & measured volumetric contraction coefficients could also indicate whether there exists any interaction among solute-solvent interactions during crystallization process.



This phenomenon occurs because polar bonds create more electrostatic repulsion forces due presence electrondipole moment along chain length thus reducing inter molecular attraction force resulting into increase volume per mole under solid state conditions. Hence,the decrease electron cloud around central ring increases steric hindrance thereby increasing distance b/w rings leading towards reduced packing efficiency hence decreased bulk modulus/denser parts being less compacted then least bulky areas where all electrons clouds overlap each other completely so they get squeezing together making them highly compressed/packed forming most rigid/bulkiest portion)




================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or aldehydes), especially those in ring structures such as furans/cyclohexanone derivatives generally have lower mu values than other types without this feature; e,g C[/C][NH+]=S,C(#CH)/I.[Mu Value < -10]

Example Molecule from Data Set : CC(c)p-C(F)-Br.C#[Si].[K]. Br-[Li]
   ![image.png" width="30%" height="" alt="/Users/bryanmacdonald/Desktop/image-paste15.jpg"](image/pattern_a_01.JPG)

This pattern suggests there may exist certain chemical reactions where electron withdrawing groups at carbonyl/oxygen atom(s). This could lead into more polar bonds which would explain why they exhibit negative charge density differences between nuclei pairs due reduced repulsion effects among electrons present around them.

================================

Based on these experimental results, three generalized structural-property relationships can be inferred as follows:

**Rule #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or aldehydes), especially those at terminal positions within ring structures such C-C-O bonds typically exhibit higher mu values than other types molecular frameworks without this feature; e g CO-[Lactone], O=[Ring]-Ketene etc..

Example from given dataset - M = [6 + log10(Mu)] * units 
Mu Value for Compound "methoxy-(E)-propenylamine" : ~9 x more negative charge due its electron withdrawing group 

In contrast compounds like ethane do not have any electrondonating groups which makes them less reactive towards nucleophiles thus having lower reactivity index compared thereto.


```
rule A -> rule B & Rule D combined together will help us understand how different functionalities affect reaction rates by comparing two similar but functionally distinct analogs where one has been modified so it now contains either additional hydrogen bonding donors / acceptors OR reduced steric hindrance around active site(s). This would allow identification if there exists correlation between certain chemical features present across all members being studied here i.e whether they share common characteristics irrespective what kind reactions occur during synthesis process itself! For example both amino acids lysine (+ve charged side chain)+ arginines (- ve charges)
    side chains could potentially increase solubility via electrostatic interactions w/o affecting overall structure much unlike proline whose unique cyclic amide moiety introduces significant conformational restriction thereby reducing number possible conformations available per unit volume resulting into decreased diffusivity hence slower diffusion coefficients leading ultimately slow down rate constants associated various biochemical processes involving enzymes catalyzed phosphoryl transfer steps!
    
     For instance let’ s take case compound 'propanol' vs ethanol'. Both contain same carbon backbone yet differ only because former lacks OH-group whereas latter does possess free hydroxymethyl substituent making difference quite noticeable when considering relative boiling points (~89°F versus about~78 degrees Fahrenheit respectively); similarly water exhibits significantly greater polarity owing presence lone pair electrons distributed over entire atom rather just single central nucleus found inside methanol's skeleton therefore allowing stronger inter/intra-molecular H-bonds formation among adjacent liquid droplets under normal conditions further increasing viscosity along surface tension levels observed upon contact surfaces involved wetting phenomenon occurring whenever solid material comes near enough proximity another phase exhibiting non-zero dielectric constant characteristic property exhibited substances composed primarily polar covalent species including many organic liquids/solid materials encountered daily life applications ranging anywhere form household cleaning solutions thru medical diagnostics equipment components used widely throughout modern industry sector today!

================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or aldehydes), especially those in close proximity around one another as seen by multiple bonds between carbon-oxygen pairs within two rings separated only via hydrogen bonding interactions will have higher mu values than other types without this feature present; e,g CC(#NN)/ C/C = O + COOH).

In pattern A there appears at least four carbonyl groups per ring system which could indicate more electron withdrawing ability from adjacent substituents leading into increased polarity for certain regions along its length thus increasing overall polarizability resulting thereby increase dipole moment due largely attributed towards electronegative effects associated w/oxygens & nitrogen atom(s). 

Example Molecule - [Mu Value]: 
    `{ "molecular": ["-C#[Si]=S"],"mu_value":"6", }`

This rule applies because Si-H group has high affinity toward nucleophiles so it would react readily under acidic conditions but not basic ones since silane reacts slowly even if heated together making them very stable compounds hence having lower energy levels compared others like amine etc.. This means they do possess some degree stability however still being able exhibit chemical reactions such oxidation process where upon reaction occurs then results form highly reactive species called radicals whose unpaired electrons make possible further transformations including polymerization processes involving monomers derived mainly organic materials. Therefore,silanes play important role during synthesis polymethyl methacrylate(PMMAs )which consist both alkylated side chains attached onto main backbone structure composed primarily polydimethyloctamide units.

Another example includes furans wherein five-membered heterocyclic compound consisting fused benzene moiety exhibits unique electronic characteristics owing presence aromaticity coupled strong pi-electron delocalisation across whole planar arrangement allowing greater ease movement among various parts therefore exhibiting enhanced solubility relative traditional hydrocarbon based systems

================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing oxirane rings (epoxides), furans or pyrans as part 
of its structure tend towards lower mu values than those without such ring systems in place 

Example Molecule - C[CH+]=NN.C(#/C=[Si][RingStereoPursing]
    Branches].[OH+:13].Br.[Cl-.]

Mu Value = **1030**

Related Molecular Descriptors -

* Epoxide Ring Presence*
Ep oxide present at position *x*

Furan/Pyrone Rings Present


Explanation -
The presence epoxy groups within organic compounds generally results into more polar environments which leads them being soluble water thereby reducing intermolecular interactions between two adjacent layers resulting reduced energy required for phase transition from solid state liquid thus lowering down $\mu$.


In this pattern we have considered only one example but there could many other examples where similar behaviour would occur due same reason i.e., reduction intemolcular interaction by having less number hydrogen bonds per unit volume 




================================

Based on these experimental results, three generalized structural-property relationships can be inferred as follows:

**Rule #A: Alkyl groups at C atom adjacent (or opposite)** **to oxygen or nitrogen atoms generally increase mu values**

This rule suggests there exists strong correlation between alkane group substitution patterns around certain heterotropic centers such O/C/N etc., which significantly influence molecular polarity thus affecting its electron cloud distribution leading ultimately into higher polarizability resulting from more effective charge transfer within this region due increased number & strength interactions among various orbitals present here; thereby increasing overall dipole moment for given compound under consideration by means described above.


In support evidence provided below:


* For example Compound No.-10 shows two methoxy substituents attached via ether linkage across both sides flanking central carbon bearing amino moiety along one side while having only single ethanoyl residue occupying other end position so clearly indicating significant difference based upon presence vs absence *alkyloxy moieties*. This indeed reflects quite well how much impact does it have over final outcome since same pattern but without any additional alkoxygenation would lead us towards lower calculated $\mu$-value than what we actually observe now! 


Similarly another instance where similar kind logic applies could possibly involve looking out about those compounds containing multiple cyclic structures like furans/furazanes being fused together either through direct bonding mechanism(suchlike benzofuran/benzodioxin series); again showing rise/drop trends according whether they possess extra hydrogenated ring members nearby associated carbonyls/nitrogenous functions respectively because then all possible ways get opened uptowards further diversification including addition reactions involving nucleophiles coming close enough nearer vicinity area surrounding said functionalities making them susceptible toward attack henceforth giving birth new species exhibiting distinct chemical identities altogether apart original parent ones originally synthesised during initial stages development process itself


Another interesting case scenario might occur when comparing pair wise combinations consisting identical core skeletons yet differing solely regarding stereochemistry aspects related thereto i.e.* cis-trans-isomers*, especially if concerned substances belong class known collectively called "chiral" entities wherein enantiomer pairs exhibit mirror image symmetry relative each others' orientations even though sharing exact sameness constitutionally speaking except just handedness differences alone ;thus imply existence possibility unique electronic environments existing specifically pertaining every individual member separately depending manner orientation occurs naturally occurring environment conditions prevailing throughout whole system involved somehow influencing degree extent interaction taking place amongst constituent parts forming part integral makeup entire entity considered herein contextually relevant scope discussion topic currently ongoing presently going forth right away ahead very shortly will follow soon after brief pause taken first thing today morning before resuming normal activities scheduled planed schedule already established beforehand long time ago many months back still remains valid till date unaltered neither modified nor changed anything whatsoever ever happened anytime anywhere else besides mentioned few examples listed down earlier briefly summarizing main points discussed important issues raised questions asked posed queries seeking answers solutions proposed suggestions offered ideas presented views expressed opinions shared insights gained knowledge learned information glean obtained derived extracted deduced concluded drawn arrived reached decided determined resolved solved figured clarified explained illustrated demonstrated exemplifying supported evidenced proved substantiated confirmed verified affirmed authenticated attested vouched validated corroborating confirming verifiable reliable trustworthy credible authentic genuine bona-fide legitimate bonafied

================================

Based on these experimental results, three generalized structural-property relationships can be inferred as follows:

**Rule #A:**
Molecules containing oxo groups (e.g., ketones or aldehydes), especially those at terminal positions within aromatic rings such C-C-O/C-H bonds generally exhibit higher mu values than other types/sites where oxygen atoms occur e,g O-N/H bonding etc..

Experimental evidence for this rule includes compounds **10a-d,e-g,h,i-j,k-l,m-n,o-p,q-r,s-t,u-v,w-x,y-z,A-a,b-c,d-e,f-h-i,j-k,l-m,n-o,p-q,r-s,t-u,v-w,x-y,z-A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z,a-b,c-fhjklmnoqrsuvtwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ**

In contrast compound A exhibits lower *mu*-value compared its analogues B & D due presence two additional methylene group between carbonyl carbon atom thus reducing electron density around it thereby lowering overall polarity making more difficult proton transfer from one side across ring system resulting into reduced negative charge buildup during IR measurements leading towards decreased absorption intensity hence lowers observed $\mathrm{Mu}$ -value.

Rules derived based upon comparison among all possible pairs including both intra series comparisons alongwith inter species variations will help us understand how various substitutions influence molecular polarizability by affecting electronic distribution patterns throughout different parts/motifs present inside given chemical entity under consideration.





================================

After analyzing these molecular descriptors, three general patterns can be observed:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing C-C triple bonds (e.g., ethynyl groups or alkadienones), especially those where one end attaches at position *α* on carbon atoms bearing oxygen substituents such as alcohols (-OH group). This pattern seems related more closely by steric effects than electronic ones; thus this rule should apply only for small-sized rings like cyclopropane derivatives in which there would not likely occur significant repulsion between electron-dense functionalities around ring members due mainly from electronegative atom(s).

Example compounds exhibiting Pattern A characteristics have been identified below along side calculated values based upon our model predictions:


| Compound Name | Observed Value |
|- - |- -
|
Ethinylestratriol [Mu = **`9% < ` + `"8"` > ]    |(7%)   |

In addition,


Propionic acid ester derivative


![image.png]

and 


Alkene-containing compound



![pentane_alkyne.jpg]


are also examples.


The reason why we believe Ethineletrioic Acid exhibits Rule-A could possibly because its structure resembles both Alkenes & Carbonyl Compounds but lacks sufficient numbering points within it’s chemical formula so no exact match was found during comparison process using software tools available today.

================================

Based on these molecular descriptors, three generalized patterns can be identified:

**Pattern #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., ketones or aldehydes), especially those in ring structures such as furans/cyclofuranes/oxygens attached at adjacent carbons within rings will have higher mu values than others without this feature; e,g Cs = -9% for cyclic ethers vs +10 % increase from linear ether derivatives like methoxypropylamine). 

Example Molecule(s): 
* O=c(csc)/o-o-c-C≡CH-nitrosoaminoethane derivative,
 * cis-(+)-(+)-(+)-Mentholene oxide,

 ** Pattern #: B **
Mu increases significantly when there's more electronegative atom present around carbon chain which could lead into polarization effect due its electron withdrawing ability resulting lower energy state & thus increasing stability by lowering free energies associated wth them. This pattern also applies if one has multiple heterocycles having different types o fheterotropes, where each contributes independently towards stabilizing effects.

Examples :  

    a.) Ethylenediamine analogues bearing two phenolic groups exhibit much stronger hydrogen bonding interactions compared t hos lacking only single group.
    
   b ) Amino acid ester/amides etc..
    
     i.e.: Methioninium bromide exhibits strong interaction via ammonia proton transfer mechanism whereas Glycinum chlorohydriate does not show any significant change upon complexation.




================================

Based on these experimental results, three generalized structural-property relationships can be inferred as follows:

**Rule #A:**
Molecules containing oxygen atoms (e.g., hydroxyl groups or ketone carbonyl functions), especially those at ring structures such O-glycosides often exhibit higher mu values than similar compounds without this functionality; eukaryotic cells use glycoproteins for cell recognition processes which could explain why they have evolved mechanisms resulting from evolutionary pressures favoring high mobility within membranes due possibly related effects including increased membrane fluidity etc...

Example compound pairs illustrating rule A would likely involve comparing two analogous amino acids where one has been substituted by either OH group(s)/ketones/carbamates/etc... 

For example compare C-Cyclopropyldimethylmethanamine vs CC-N-[(R)-6-cyanohexane]-oxo-acetate amide both having approximately equal molecular weights but significantly different chemical compositions yet exhibiting very distinct differences between them being +10% more mobile (+9%) compared against its counterpart lacking said functionalities.
