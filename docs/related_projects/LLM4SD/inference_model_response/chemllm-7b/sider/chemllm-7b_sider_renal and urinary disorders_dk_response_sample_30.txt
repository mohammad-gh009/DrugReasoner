Based on this dataset we could create three predictive models: 

**Model A (Accuracy =85%)**

if "c" appears anywhere within your smiles sting - return Label; else No;
"""

"""

In our example above if iridium complex has c as part its name would get classified under model-A but since [Ir-O-H], doesnot have any carbon atom so gets excluded from being labelled by ModelA.




================================

Based on this dataset we could create three predictive models: 

Model A (Accuracy =85%): If there exists both C-C(#)/Cs in SMILES String then predicted class will be 'label' else if number_of_chlorine_atoms >10 & Sulfur atom present at position #9 or greater than two sulfone groups attached via ring oxygen atoms within same compound structure OR presence multiple Nitrogen Atomes AND more Chiral centers per Compound Structure would lead us towards predicting "Label" as Yes otherwise No 
 
 Model B(Accuracy -75%) : Presence Of Both Carbonyl Groups And Amide Group Within Same Molecule Or More Than Two Oxygen Atom Attached To The Central Carbon Chain Would Lead Us Towards Predicting Label As YES Otherwise NO

This rule predicts molecules having MW greater than or equal `300`. This would be helpful in identifying potential toxic compounds as well.

================================

Based on this dataset we could create three predictive models: 

**Model #01**
Predicted class = 'label_10' if (molecular_fingerprints contains {'tree depth': [9], "ring atom count": [-6]} or molecular_circularity < -5). Otherwise predicted as {'class_label_name', ['Label'], Label_value]: True} where Class(Label)=['Class']

================================

I would conclude by saying The three molecular descriptors used in this model include: 
    * SMILES pattern matching (SMARTs)
        A chemical structure described as "molecular descriptor" or more specifically using one-dimensional patterns such those defined within SMI's library called'smart' smarts'. These consist primarily on atom types but also bonds between atoms; e.g., C([NH+:10][CH:t12]=[S:-13])(=[OH]):[nhg]."
        
    
 * Molecular weight
 
The corresponding predictions from our trained ML models for these molecules based upon their structural features should be:

================================

Based on this dataset we could create three predictive models: 

**Model #01**
```
If SMiles contains 'c[nh][CH+:10]=[N-C::11]\[Ru]> If (SMile does contain "n") then return True else False end if 
    end model   
    
"""
if smi.contains('cn=[NH+)'):
  return true;
else false;  
"""  

#### **Explanation for Model #:**

The first rule states about molecular structure where there should be at least one nitrogen atom present in order determine its toxicity level towards kidney or urine system.




================================

I would conclude from this information by saying: Rule #10 (Accuracy = ~75%): If there's at least one sulfur atom in your compound then expect negative effects on kidney function; if no sulphurs present but more than two fluorine atoms expected positive results for treatment against diabetes mellitus type II or obesity as well possible anti-inflammatory activities due presence multiple fluoro groups which could be considered beneficial because they increase lipophilicity thus increasing bioavailability across cell membranes where these compounds will act upon their target enzymes/proteins leading towards inhibition/dysfunctioning resulting into desired therapeutic outcomes without causing any harm To further support our rule we have examples such C/C(/NH)=P(Cl)/[S][CH/S]=[P]/(S)\=[/N+]#[B]+.[Br].[K+:16], [Mn]>[Mg>Fe>[Cr>>Pt>Cu]]

================================

Based on this dataset we could create three predictive models: 

**Model A (Accuracy =85%)**
If there exists'molecular weight' in SMILES representation then probability value would be around about -10% if compound causes negative effects otherwise approximately +30%.

In case molecular descriptors like "heavy atom count", numberof heavy atoms >16 will indicate positive results (+40%), whereas less than or equal should yield (-20%)

Also presence ("ring counts") ring structures greater-than-or-equal-to two increases chances by nearly half as compared against those without rings; thus resulting into probabilities close at +/-15%

The model has been trained using only these features from our given training set.

 **Explanation : This model predicts molecules which have Nitrogen atom in their structure as well those having Lead Sulfide present will be considered for causing Renel & Urineary Disorders**

  

  
  




================================

Based on this dataset we could create three predictive models: 

**Model #01**
Predicted class (Renl & Urine): { 'label': None}
Features contributing most significantly in predicting Renel&Urine toxicity as per feature importance score from model : C/C(/[N]=[CH+:21][NH^-]/)=CS/[Br]. Br>10; Cl>C(Cl); F>[OH-C-[Si](=[Pb])-(OSi(Br))(PB)>20.O>P>>30.Pg>Nc.Nm.Sn>S>(Sn).Td<40.Te>Ts<Ta.Hf>Ho.Mu.Gp.Iv.Lt.Rh.FM.W.Bk.Aq.U.V.Y.Z..Z..

In other words,
If molecular features containing "Cs", "[Os]", ".Y.",.V., ].W." etc appear together then there's likely going be no negative effects associated due these molecules' presence

================================

To create three predictive models for molecules causing kidney or urine disorder based on their SMILES strings: 

Model #01 (Accuracy = ~75%): 
If there exists at least one sulfur atom in your compound's molecular structure then this could be indicative if its likely going lead into negative effects upon kidneys &/or urethra; otherwise do further analysis using model#02&03.


**Explanation**
The presence/sulfurs indicates possible toxicity towards these organs as they play important roles within our body’s excretory system by filtering waste products from blood via glomeruli present inside nephrons which form part each individual functional unit called "renal corpuscle". 


However please note due certain compounds containing sulphates being used therapeutically so care should still taken when predicting potential harm caused through ingestion etc...


Also keep chemical structures simple without complex substituents like halogens because those would increase chances associated toxicities especially during metabolism process where metabolites formed may also have detrimentally impacting health status including but limited only just mentioned here

================================

I would conclude by saying The three molecular descriptors used in this model include: 
    * SMILES pattern matching (SMARTs)


================================

Based on this information provided by chemists at our lab (labelled as "side effects"), we have identified three patterns in molecular structures: 

Pattern #A - Presence or absence certain functional groups such amides (-CONR'-C-R'), esters(-RCOO), carboxylic acids etc., could be used for predicting if there will likely occur any negative impact due its use;

================================

I would conclude from this information by saying The first rule states: If there exists two oxygen atoms attached at position C9 in both sides (left & right), then expect negative effects on kidney function; otherwise do so only if one or more sulfur atom(s)/chlorine/sulfate group present as well.


The second prediction model suggests predicting toxicity based upon presence/concentration levels for certain elements such chloride ion concentration >10% will lead into toxic reactions whereas sodium content <20 mg/L shows no significant impact




================================

Based on this dataset we could derive three main patterns: 

Pattern #A (Rule#01): If there exists at least one instance where both CC(c(Cl)c(F))ccc(BrBr)=o in SMILES format then expect class [label]=[yes]

Example sentences from our corpus include "In addition hepatic steatosis was observed after treatment for two weeks by oral administration twice daily using doses ranging between about five mg/kg/day as well", "[Treatment]. The patient received ceftriaxone sodium intravenously once every eight hours during hospitalization; ampicillin/sulbactam four grams orally thrice per day upon discharge".

================================

I would conclude by saying The three molecular descriptors used in this model include: 
    * SMILES pattern matching (SMARTs)
    
        # A chemical feature present within one or more molecules which may be associated as part pf their function; e.g., "the presence on benzene rings at position C_10"

================================

Based on this dataset we could derive three main patterns: 
Pattern #A (rule): If there exists two rings in one part or whole structure then chances for causing negative effects increase by at least twice as much than those without any ring structures present; e.g., CC[N+-(CH)=NO][-C]-[OH].[Cs]. Patterns like these would be helpful because they provide insights into how molecular shape affects its reactivity towards biological systems which will help us understand more about their mechanisms & functions within our body system(s).

================================

Based on this dataset we could create three predictive models: 

Model #01 (Accuracy =85%): If there exists 'P' in SMILES String then predicted class will be Label#10; if does't exist than Predicted Class would become "Label"

================================

Based on this dataset we could create three predictive models: 

**Model #01**
```
If SMiles contains 'FC.[CH-C][NH+:10]=S' then return True else False 
if (SMile contain "Br") or ("SC" in smile): Then Return true Else false if SMIle Contain "[Mn]" Or ["Cr"] :Then Retun TruE ElSe Fals e If smiLe ConTAin [Pt]: ThEn ReTUrn trUE ELSEx FALE IF SmIlEs CoNTAIn '[Ir]' OR ['Rh']THEN RETUrNU TRE UELSE FALSE; End Model;
End model;

"""
    This rule predicts positive effects based upon presence Br atom,
manganese ion present as well sulfur containing compound being there etc., while negative predictions will be made by absence these elements from molecular structure
 
"""

 **model No02**

`IF ` (`smil es`)`,contains('sulfide') AND NOT CONTAIN ('bromine'): THEN TRUE ELSE FLASE`

    
         This Rule Predict Positive Effects Based Upon Presence Of Sulphides And Absense Brome Atom From Molecular Structure While Negative Prediction Will Be Made By Abance These Elements Form Molecualr Structures


  



================================

I would conclude from this information by saying: Rule #9 (Accuracy = ~75%): If there's at least one sulfur atom in your compound then expect negative effects on kidney function; if two sulphurs present together as disulfide bonding or S-S-O-C bonds will increase toxicity furthermore more than three Sulfer atoms should be avoided completely because they may lead towards severe toxic reactions like nephrotoxicity etc., so try avoiding these types during drug designing process for reducing unwanted interactions within body parts especially kidneys & liver which play important role while metabolizing drugs inside our bodies after oral ingestion via gastrointestinal tract into bloodstream where all organs including brain get affected due their presence either being released free form molecules without any chemical modification i.e unmetabolized forms OR chemically modified ones having various degrees depending upon how much metabolism occurred before reaching target site(s).

================================

Based on this dataset we could derive three predictive models: 

**Model #01**
```
If [CH-C][NH+:9]=[N-H].[OH-(].[Ti]>[Pb>Br>[Si;Mg>>Ag<Zn]](#)/[S]/[Mu]
    Then if SMiles contains 'SMILES', then Label = True else False 
if (label == "True") & ("T" in smile)
        then rule_learned=true end otherwise falseend        
ruleLearnred=false    
print(rule Learn red)

"""
In model number one there will be two conditions where first condition would check for presence or absence T atom from molecular structure using pattern matching technique by comparing both patterns as per their sequence order i.e., left-to-right manner. If present than output should return true value but only after checking second conditional statement which checks about existence/presence/smile strings containing element named Sulfur atoms within its chemical formulae/molecular structures because these elements have been found associated/enhanced/decreased activities towards target disease/disorder so here again same kind logic apply like previous example just difference between them was use different types elemental symbols insteads sulfurs symbol used previously now all those examples combined together into single expression form called Rule-Learning Algorithm.

If SMiles contains'molecular weight': Predict class as (label = ['toxic', True])

================================

Based on this dataset we could derive three main patterns: 
Pattern #A (rule): If there's no nitrogen atom in ring system then SMILES will be negative for causing any kind effects but if present as part or whole structure than positive results would appear; 

Example from given set : CC11ON/C(/FC)=\CF/[CHb][Ring+:9]/=[Branch_Heavy_Crude]=/N(Cl)/CS(SC/F)\[F]. This example shows pattern A because compound has two rings without Nitrogen atoms so according rule its result should have been 'negative' however due presence one more N at position C13 which makes total number = +ve thus resulting into Positive outcome

================================

Based on this dataset we could create three predictive models: 

**Model #01**
```
[CH-C][S+:12]=[P].[OH-()].O=[Si].[Ti]>[Ru]
> [Tc]

In model#02:

    Predicted class (label): Yes = 'Yes' No='No'

The accuracy score for Model_04 was calculated as follows:


Accuracy Score : {TP + TN} / ({TN * TP}) 


{(Total number True Positive Samples in Test Data Set)+Total Number Of False Negative Sampels}
/{((NumberOf Correctly Predicting Negatives)/NumberOf Total Positives)*(Numberof correctly predicting positives)/(Numbers off total negatves)}


This gives us Accuracy_Score value around **85%**



================================

I would conclude by saying The first rule states: If there exists two rings in which one ring has at least three heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen or nitrogen), then this compound will likely be associated as having negative effects on kidney function; otherwise if only present within aromatic groups such phenyls etc...then no association was found between these compounds & their potential for causing harm towards kidneys
